 my hon friend have be a real constituency champion in highlight some of the flooding issue that have occur in north warwickshire and bedworth of the environment agency investment over year £ be go specifically into protect property and i know we will have further discussion on the work that he be do locally to tackle flooding 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response as he will know the northern ireland assembly be back up and run we have a minister in place to deal with flooding but money must be spend wisely and effectively what discussion have the secretary of state have with the northern ireland assembly minister at this early stage to ensure that lesson learn here on the mainland can be use back home where over the past year flooding have become an exceptional problem that worry many people 
 i think the whole house welcome the fact that the assembly be back up and run the hon gentleman will appreciate that i be very keen as a former chief secretary to the treasury that money be spend in a value for money way i be in the northern ireland secretary ’s constituency just last week to discuss a range of issue in northern ireland and i be very keen that we learn from each other about the good way to tackle flooding 
 what step he be take to encourage supermarket to promote british produce 
 i welcome the campaign of my hon friend   the member for bosworth dr evans   and the action take by some supermarket to introduce a buy british button online and i strongly support their effort to encourage consumer to pick high quality british produce the department for environment food and rural affairs have launch a consultation on fair food labelling to help promote british produce and statutory code that ensure that british farmer get a fair price for their good 
 of the good way we can support british farmer be by choose to buy british food it be good for the environment reduce food mile and improve our food security because we be import less produce will my right hon friend the farming minister join i in specifically congratulate morrisons aldi sainsbury ’s and ocado which all now have the buy british button online so that consumer can easily find british food to buy

 what recent assessment he have make of the cleanliness of england ’s waterway 
 what recent assessment he have make of the cleanliness of england ’s waterway 
 what recent progress his department have make on improve water quality 
 we know how important clean water be to the public and we share their concern and outrage about pollution in waterway that be why we have increase monitoring of storm overflow in england from under labour in to today and we be now hold water company to account on tackle pollution by quadruple the   number of check increase unannounced inspection give ofwat new power to block bonus and take action against water company that do not link dividend to environmental performance 
 household across the north west could see their water bill rise by nearly by as water company look to consumer to meet the cost of much need infrastructure upgrade do the government agree that the cost of stem the flow of sewage into our waterway should be meet by the water company and the shareholder who be receive hundred of million of pound in payout last year not by the hard- work british public 
 the government be absolutely clear that no should pay extra for water company to clean up our river we be pleased that water company have promise a £ investment over the next year across england and wales and we will continue to hold polluter to account just this week we announce a fast track investment of £ over the next month to prevent more than sewage spill from pollute english waterway 
 we should not have an open sewer flow through the city of york and when it flood flow into business and people ’s home while water company executive have pocket £ in bonus my constituent have have to put up with sewage release when will the minister end this profiteering and invest in upgrade york ’s sewerage infrastructure how do he intend to do this 
 as i say we have already see water company want to invest £ over the next price review cycle i recently visit york and work be be undertake by yorkshire water to address sewage pollution spill ofwat have already be give power to take a much tough approach to boss bonus if their company be deem to have be pollute this government will continue to hold water company to account 
 i welcome the action that this government be take to improve water quality but in wales which have some of the bad level of sewage pollution there be no legally bind target for the water company to reduce sewage or to upgrade their waste water treatment plant and there be no overall reduction plan for sewage there be not even any prosecution because the policy in wales be not to prosecute these company do the minister know which party be run the administration in wales 
 i share my right hon friend ’s concern about labour ’s failure to tackle spill from storm overflow in wales where the average number of spill from storm overflow be third high than in england i be not surprise by this because we know that when labour be last in government in only of storm overflow be monitor compare with today per cent of bathing water be now class as good or excellent compare with just under labour in 
 drinking water be treat with both ultraviolet light and chlorine before it go into our tap so it be perfectly safe water that go through water treatment work be treat but not necessarily disinfect by the use of uv unless it be head towards a designate bathing water 
 france be host the olympics in paris and the seine be be treat with performic acid place in this country southwold be use performic acid right now but scientist from the department for environment food and rural affairs and the environment agency have so far be reluctant to roll it out if it be good enough for people to swim in the seine during the olympics surely it be good enough to start use this treatment which be cheap and could be deploy across our country 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise this important issue and i reassure she that i be have conversation with official not only in the environment agency but in defra on this very issue i be more than happy to meet she so she can share her knowledge from when she be secretary of state 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be clear from what we have hear that the minister be here to tell we how well the government and the water company be do meanwhile out there in the real world the recent state of our rivers report expose that not english river be in a good overall condition the capital ’s water supplier be on the brink of collapse and the only solution that the government be even consider be steal from the labour party be it not the truth that what britian ’s river really can not afford be more year of this useless government 
 when the leader of the opposition say that he would want wales to be his blueprint if labour get into power in england i fear for this country we have see far bad water pollution under welsh labour as have already be say we will continue with our plan for water which be about more investment strong regulation and much tough enforcement against those who pollute 
 whether he have have recent discussion with thames water on its proposal for the teddington direct river abstraction project 
 defra support by the environment agency be currently seek clarification from thames water on its revise draft water resource management plan to help inform the next step for the teddington project the proposal be still at an early stage thames water will continue to carry out further consultation over the next couple of year to help it design and carry out further environmental assessment of the scheme 
 the water resource management plan for the south east which contain the highly controversial teddington direct river abstraction proposal oppose by ten of thousand of local resident and river user across south west london have be sit on the environment secretary ’s desk since august we have be call for the teddington proposal to be take out of the plan and we be tell that a decision would be make by christmas then by february and now we be tell it will be make in due course in the meantime as the minister suggest thames water be waste huge amount of billpayer money on the proposal so will he confirm when the secretary of state plan to make a decision on the water resource management plan and whether he will take the teddington project out of it 
 this follow on from a conversation i have with the hon lady and her constituency neighbour   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney we be well aware of thames water ’s proposal for this scheme which be still in a consultation stage it be of strategic water resource option be consider across the thames catchment and i will be update by thames water as will the secretary of state when it have complete its consultation 
 what recent estimate he have make with cabinet colleague of the cost to business of not for eu labelling 
 what recent estimate he have make with cabinet colleague of the cost to business of not for eu labelling 
 the department engage regularly with uk industry to understand the impact of the windsor framework and we encourage business to respond to the consultation which be still live 
 during my various meeting include at the uk corporate headquarters of bidfood in my constituency exasperated business have express serious concern about the damage be inflict on they by the conservatives ill think through not for eu labelling scheme along with increase consumer confusion it will also likely reduce choice and raise price for shopper secretary of state why be this incompetent government so hellbent on burden british business with more bureaucracy and red tape and increase their cost base 
 let i say that there be a consultation taking place so there be discussion on this secondly £ have already be allocate as transitional support thirdly particularly for colleague in northern ireland it be important that far from restrict choice we maintain it that be exactly what the windsor framework which the house as a whole agree to be design to do 
 a correctly label shipment for go nut a firm in park royal make it to felixstowe on   january   but shockingly it have only just be release from   be impound that be due to a custom staff shortage at the border so will the government fix that the company incur a figure sum for day storage plus vat the government be throw small business under the bus albeit a sadiq khan bus with low emission 
 i will leave it to other to deduce the link to sadiq khan ’s bus i think the hon lady prepare her question before the previous answer because i just set out that we be give £ of transitional labelling support of course a consultation be live and we be work with business on it 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the food and drink federation have warn the uk government that their plan to require all meat and dairy sell in the uk to have not for eu labelling attack will divert hundred of million of pound of investment away from the uk and that several international investor have pause their plan to invest in uk food and drink as we continue to circle the drain of tory impose recession will the secretary of state tell the house and the public if drive investment away from this vital sector will help or hinder attempt to avoid yet great recession 
 of course we will work with industry on any change but the snp need to be consistent because we have other proposal such as the review of public sector procurement be carry out by my hon friend   the member for colchester will quince   and fair labelling for example pig rear overseas be often market as british bacon and our labelling change often have widespread support from the farming sector it be important that we do these change with the industry which be why we have allocate £ of transitional support 
 what step he be take to support farmer 
 british farmer put food on our table and form the backbone of the rural economy and this government will always back our farmer that be why in january we increase the rate pay through the environmental land management action by an average of and increase the number of choice through the new action for farmer 
 concern that farmer have raise about the sustainable farming incentive be that they have to pay money up front before they can receive compensation or reclaim that money from the government a farmer in my constituency instal a stone track to prevent soil from wash on to the road he commit to the bacs payment before he receive the money from the department for environment food and rural affairs but because it leave his account day later he now have to pay his defra money back this be an insane situation and he can not afford this he be go to have   to take this track up and sell the stone will the secretary of state help i with this case so that we get those environmental protection scheme in place and do not penalise people for time difference 
 i be happy to look at any individual case the hon lady raise secondly i agree with she on the wide point i have be very clear with the rural payments agency that we need a more trusting relationship about payment we need to accelerate those payment so they be pay more quickly to be fair to the rpa there be sometimes constraint because of national audit office rule around the error rate check it need we be work with the rpa to shift the relationship to build more on trust where payment go out in a more expedited fashion 
 fisherman be the farmer of the sea what further step be the secretary of state take to support the aquaculture industry especially help it to create new business across our coastal community 
 my hon friend know from our regular conversation just how engaged i be on this subject he meet with the minister for water and rural growth yesterday as he know there be a consultation about medical exemption for boat under metre i know the minister for food farming and fisheries be look closely at the issue around pollack i be happy to update my hon friend on a series of other initiative as we work through they 
 have the secretary of state actually talk to the national farmers union recently have he even talk to the celebrity farmer on television who we all know about what be the plan farmer be in a period of stasis they do not know where they be go or how they be go to face the future because there be no plan under this incompetent administration 
 not only have i speak to the new president of the nfu he have be in my office already but i have be on his farm to discuss these matter i have also be his deputy ’s farm in fact on be appoint secretary of state the meeting i have be with the former nfu president and the meeting in my office within a week be with the then president of the nfu so i regularly engage with colleague in the nfu just this week i have a meeting with the nfu county president for cambridgeshire however i be surpass in that engagement by the minister for food farming and fisheries who have discussion with the nfu even more frequently 
 on a recent visit to church farm in weston turville in my constituency the family who have farm there for generation stress how important it be for they to be able to diversify their income for example with their very popular farm shop which sell their produce and that of nearby farmer however current planning rule limit the shop to opening on day a year will my right hon friend update the house on his conversation with the department for   levelling up housing and communities and across government about make it easy for farmer to diversify their income so that we can assure the food security that be so vital to our nation 
 my hon friend raise an important point my focus and that of the minister for food farming and fisheries be and foremost on ensure food production and food security be viable for our farmer but diversification be also important i be in advanced discussion with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on extend permit development right 
 to go back to the question raise by   the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman a certain very famous farmer have raise his frustration in oxfordshire i want to streamline permit development to make it easy for farmer to diversify but and foremost farmer want to produce food which be my key focus 
 i call the shadow minister 
 farmer need support against potentially devastating contagious disease such as african swine fever i recently visit dover where the diligent port health authority regularly seize contaminate meat yet next month its defra funding will be cut by and incredibly those border check will be move mile inland why be the conservatives put the farmer of this country and our national security at risk 
 that be a timely question just yesterday i have a meeting with the chief veterinary officer to discuss our security risk particularly in the context of bluetongue disease it may not be catch the house ’s attention today but i be concerned that it will become a widely debate issue by the summer i be actively engage in that discussion and the minister for food farming and fisheries be have a roundtable on that live security issue next week last week i speak at the british veterinary association annual dinner which the hon gentleman also attend so he see in person just how engaged we be with these issue 
 when his department plan to publish its strategy for chemical 
 this government be commit to protect human health and the environment and we will be set out our priority for address risk from chemical in due course to be clear though the new draft strategy set out that our chemical policy and regulatory decision will be independent of the eu they will be bespoke to the uk 
 the cosmetic sector be often overlook perhaps because we be unwilling to show how dependent we be on that sector or perhaps because so many of the people who work in that sector be woman the cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association manifesto make it clear that it require a safe and sustainable supply of chemical within a robust internationally   compatible regulatory framework be it not clear that this ongoing chaos with the chemical strategy mean that what it actually require be a change of government 
 a great many people from that industry be at an international woman ’s event about sustainability that i speak at yesterday in our engagement on the new alternative transition model which involve work with the industry very closely we be take into account the fact that supply chain be complicated that they operate cross border and that the sector value access we will be consult on the strategy very shortly 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister tell i in january this year that the chemical strategy will be produce next year before correct it to this year whether it be this year next year or sometime never do she agree that the strategy will be worth the paper it be write on only if the uk regulation catch up with other country and stop hazardous substance be dump here damage our environment and public health 
 as the hon member will know there be a global framework on chemical i attend a conference on the un global framework on chemical back in september in bonn we sign up to the framework which be bind set target and international commitment and relate to finance capacity building so that we can soundly manage and handle our chemical and waste and that be exactly what we be do with our bespoke uk strategy 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 what recent assessment he have make of uk food security 
 food security be a top priority for the government and we be commit to continue to grow of our food here in the uk to back up those plan we be introduce an annual food security index and we be currently develop the content of that index we want to strike the right balance between food production and the natural environment which be why all the action in the sustainable farming incentive work to support food production and the environment 
 do the minister share my concern that a perfect storm may be brew with grain price on the floor a of the wheat crop either not be drill or flood out and rape be increasingly difficult to establish some of the long term multi annual stewardship option be become increasingly attractive and that be not to mention those idiot in wales take of land out of production do he share my concern 
 that be something we consistently and constantly review to make sure that we be strike that right balance between food production and the environment   we will continue to do that to make sure that we do not see such perverse incentive certainly give the challenge of the weather this season and the difficulty with planting cereal crop we will continue to look at whether that balance be right what i do not want be people abuse the system and put in too much wild bird mix or pollinator mix we will continue to review whether that be have an impact on the market 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests can the minister explain how his department ’s policy of take good agricultural land out of food production be compatible with improve uk food security 
 i can the sustainable farming incentive motivate farmer to improve their soil quality which be good for the production of food and incentivise farmer to look after pollinator which be good for the pollination of crop the environment and food production be side of the same coin we as farmer want to encourage farmer to look after the environment so that we can continue to produce top quality food on highly productive land 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the uk ’s departure from the eu on food price in the uk 
 if the hon member be concerned about food price i urge he to consider the impact of the scottish government ’s decision to crack down on meal deal and supermarket promotion which will mean that scottish customer pay more than english one for the same product 
 that have nothing to do with the question on the order paper the london school of economics find that brexit have add £ to the average household bill the healthcare certificate that be now require will add even more be the reality not that the cost of living crisis be a cost of westminster crisis fuel by brexit 
 the hon member seem to imply that food inflation have be unique to the uk actually we have see more severe consequence on the continent it be right to draw the house ’s attention to the decision that the snp government be take which have an impact on increase food price 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since last update the house we have continue to bring forward measure to place great prioritisation on food production and food security that include deliver a key national farmers union   ask for a food security index commit to the farm to fork summit as an annual event and the large ever round of grant for farmer worth £ announce by the prime minister to drive great productivity we be also consult on fair food label to ensure that our british farmer be fairly reward we be announce today a consultation on the next phase of our tuberculosis eradication strategy which include cull in high risk area and this week i announce that my hon friend   the member for colchester will quince   be conduct a review into public sector food procurement 
 furthermore we be take action to hold water company to account more strongly which include a fourfold increase in inspection and consult on ban bonus for company that commit serious criminal breach we be work at pace with the devolved administration on the banning of wet wipe as we cover early we continue to address the threat from the bluetongue virus i can confirm to the house that i have act on the representation of my hon friend   the member for penrith and the border dr hudson   on extend the neuter deadline for xl bully dog by some month from   january   until   june finally tomorrow the minister responsible for nature will announce the successful bid for species restoration grant build on the progress on biodiversity net gain 
 we have only minute for topical that be the problem 
 be my right hon friend aware that the inflexibility bureaucracy and cost of the seasonal poultry worker scheme make it prohibitive for business such as kelly turkeys in my constituency to hire labour for just a few week in the run up to christmas will he urge the home office to include it within the exist seasonal agricultural worker scheme thus allow producer to use labour that be already in the country 
 my right hon friend raise an important point of course there be seasonal worker visa to meet the demand in the run up to christmas he will know that from my time as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster when i deal with the issue of turkey supply before christmas i be happy to look at that issue he be talk about a finite period and i will make those representation to home office colleague 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last month i visit newcastle under lyme with local campaigner adam jogee to meet resident who be literally choke on toxic fume from the walleys quarry landfill site more than resident have complain about the stench and a year old child end up in hospital will the secretary of state publish all correspondence between defra the environment agency and the operator so that resident in newcastle under lyme can see why the site have not be close down 
 no could have do more to highlight the issue than the constituency mp indeed the minister with responsibility for water have already be to walleys quarry to look at hand have speak directly to the chief executive of the environment   agency i know that everything that can be do within the law be be do that be the assurance that the minister and i have have from the chief exec of the environment agency indeed enforcement action be take recently at that specific site 
 i chair the all party parliamentary group on fishery i welcome the limited help that the department be give to a few pollack catch hand liner but it will not help the vast majority of fisherman in my constituency who rely on that stock will the minister speak to the treasury to see whether there be any way to look at compensation for those boat or at least at decommissioning help 
 the government recognise the huge challenge face by pollack fisher we be try to offer funding to help those most affected i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s campaign and that of my hon friend the members for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory and for st austell and newquay steve double in raise the issue we be help those fisherman through the fishery and seafood scheme as well as with a new scientific study but the secretary of state and i be personally look at what other option may be available to help and support i know that my hon friend   the member for south east cornwall mrs murray   will continue her pursuit of this issue and support for her constituent 
 the public have the right to access just of land in england include thousand of access island that can only be reach by trespassing with polling now show that of the public support the extension of the right to roam through england be the government now prepare to commit to overhaul our outdated system of access right and to follow scotland in enshrine the right to roam in law 
 the hon gentleman ’s question merely highlight a fundamental difference between the front benchers of the party i want to work with farmer which be why through sfi the sustainable farming incentive we be look at permissive access where we pay incentive to farmer to provide access to their land but labour would impose a top down requirement with the right to roam rather than work constructively with our farmer and landowner which be the approach that the conservatives be take 
 lowestoft be the large town in the uk without formal flood defence with the tidal barrier project on hold due to cost increase i be most grateful to ministers for consider the compelling case to fill the funding gap that would enable a scheme to proceed that will protect property and unleash the provision of new home and business opportunity will the secretary of state assure i that he will leave no stone unturned in work across government so that the project can restart 
 i pay tribute to the amazing campaign lead by my hon friend on behalf of those in his constituency already £ of support have be secure from the department for environment food and rural affairs   for that scheme he will be aware that the local authority have change the scope and drive the cost so there be a question as to what contribution be make by partner but he be a formidable champion of the scheme and £ have already be allocate 
 hedge row provide a crucial habitat for nearly priority specie include some red list bird and they be a carbon store when cross compliance end on january this year long stand legal protection for agricultural hedgerow cease to apply end the metre buffer strip and the no cut period the government commit to reinstate important protection so will minister explain when the government will lay legislation to close gap in hedgerow protection urgently in particular as bird nest season be under way 
 the hon lady be slightly behind the time we have commit to protect our hedgerow in law in england we carry out a consultation and this measure be extremely popular with our farmer because we know how much they value hedgerow they will be protect with those regulation include the metre buffer strip from the centre of the hedge and all the rule and regulation on what can and can not be do and the cut ban we be fully behind that we be work on the fight to protect nature and that will be part of get to our nature target 
 i thank the minister responsible for water for come to vale road in colwick recently to meet resident affect by flooding i know that that meeting be very much appreciated will the minister reassure i that he and his department will carry on work with i to continue to improve flood defence in colwick and across nottinghamshire so that the resident can sleep a little well at night 
 i be glad to visit colwick and meet resident along vale road to hear about the impact of recent flooding not only on they but on resident of the wide area i will continue to work with my hon friend and with nottinghamshire county council this be not the only area that he be interested in he have also be work with my right hon friend   the member for sherwood mark spencer   to focus on lambley and woodborough as well that work will build on the £ that have already be allocate to nottinghamshire county council and be already well protect property 
 for my constituent in bradford food price have soar along with the rise cost of living the increase have recently reach a peak of 19.1%—the big in almost year make it increasingly difficult for family in bradford to make end meet what do the minister have to say to my constituent who be now pay far more for their weekly shop not just because of inflation but because the tory government have fail over year to implement a proper food strategy to support uk farmer and have put in place damage barrier to trade with the rest of europe 
 i have a really clear message for his constituent we be stick to the plan which be bring inflation down that be what the chancellor set out in the budget the number be clear on how inflation have come down and we be not risk go back to square as the hon gentleman ’s party would propose 
 my right hon friend the minister be very aware of the concern raise by the seafood processing and catch sector about recent proposal by the migration advisory committee to remove key occupation from shortage occupation list what engagement have he have with the home office to ensure that the occupation on which our food security and coastal community depend be adequately and meaningfully support 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his campaigning again on behalf of his constituent we continue to work with our friend in the home office to ensure that the fishing sector in scotland and around the uk get the labour that it require to deliver top quality british fish to the marketplace i will continue to have those discussion with the home office to ensure that we get to the right place 
 i be pleased to play a small part in pass the animals low welfare activities abroad act but the government continue to delay its implementation while captive wild animal suffer in tourist entertainment around the world example be that of elephant in thailand many of which suffer complex post traumatic stress disorder because of the psychological and physical abuse that they endure daily uk company may still advertise and sell ticket for activity that involve elephant that be force to perform for tourist will the minister assure i that the conversation will be launch as soon as possible and that the regulation will include a ban on the advertising and selling of elephant tourism 
 future decision on which animal activity will fall into the scope of the legislation will need to be evidence base and subject to parliamentary scrutiny the government continue to make animal welfare a priority we be currently explore a number of option to ensure that there be progress as soon as be practicable 
 the secretary of state be bring forward a system of extend producer responsibility to obligate brand owner include food supplier to bear the cost of recycle the packaging that they place on the market however in some estimate the cost to obligate business will be time high than under the current packaging waste recycling note system give that the cost will need to be pass to consumer do the minister share the concern that it will contribute to food price inflation 
 it be good to meet my hon friend just this week to discuss that issue i encourage all those in the packaging sector and those involve in the industry to keep feed information to my official we be review epr at the moment we have a dedicated roll out plan for it but we be very keen to hear from the industry 
 the government promise to ban plastic in wet wipe nearly a year ago on   april   last year but there be still no ban in place will the minister protect nature by ban plastic in wet wipe now 
 i be extremely keen to get the ban on wet wipe deliver have the hon lady speak to her colleague in the welsh labour government as she know these thing need to go through with agreement from the devolved administration i can assure she that i be press very hard on that and hope to have something to announce very soon interruption i will take the chuntering from the labour front benchers into those discussion 
 minister be already aware of the success of my quarterly water summit which have cause anglian water to beat the government target for reduce storm overflow by year and to pilot all year round testing of our bathing water however agency consistency fail to attend the environment agency will the minister come to the next summit and bring the environment agency with he 
 there be no doughtier champion than my hon friend who have be lobby i on this issue i be happy to commit to the environment agency attend her next summit and i will also attend in person 
 british farmer produce some of the very good produce in the world but the trend in supermarket sell it be go in the wrong direction will the minister support liberal democrat proposal to invest an additional £ in british farming and reform environmental land management scheme so that they genuinely incentivise sustainable farming 
 i agree with the hon gentleman that british farmer produce among the good food in the world but i do not agree that the trend be deteriorate quite the opposite we have the buy british campaign which a number of supermarket have already sign up to the public sector review the quince review be under way and we be look at labelling and how we well empower consumer to buy food with good animal welfare standard there be a lot of progress and it reflect the great standard we have for british food 
 can my hon friend update the house on the response to the consultation on the bid for bathing water status of which of course be for the river nidd and the lido in knaresborough 
 my official have be inundate with a huge number of response to the consultation on the bathing water site my hon friend be a doughty campaigner for the river nidd i can not say anything at the moment but he will not have to wait too long before hear the outcome 
 lidl have become the supermarket to roll out a deposit return scheme across the whole city of glasgow will   the secretary of state commend lidl on do what he block the scottish government from roll out across scotland 
 i always commend supermarket that be be innovative but part of the problem with the initiative in scotland be the amount of push back from industry that be why the scottish government pull it 
 extend producer responsibility will add financial burden to amazing food producer such as wilkin sons in tiptree in my constituency so can the secretary of state say what he be do to keep financial cost down and reduce red tape for great british food manufacturer 
 as my right hon friend know we be kindre spirit in try to keep the amount of red tape and regulation down indeed on a visit to tiptree just a couple of week ago i look at method of automation that bring the cost of food production down my right hon friend will have hear the comment from the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore who have responsibility for water a consultation on these issue be live and as a formidable constituency champion i know that my right hon friend will ensure that any concern about cost be raise in that consultation

 history will not judge kindly when ask whether we do everything we could to prevent possible genocide in gaza give the scale of suffering bring about by weapon disease hunger and in the light of the international court of justice ’s interim order on restraint when the attorney general meet the official that she refer to do she clarify that under the genocide convention the icj order must be adhere to fully and do she give any indication that the uk will cease participate in arm sale to israel until that happen 
 i know that the hon lady care very deeply about this region she and i have visit it together i reassure she that my discussion with those i meet both in israel and the occupied palestinian territories be very frank and i be confident that our message be deliver clearly i make clear the importance of international humanitarian law be respect civilian be protect and compliance with the geneva convention when it come to detainee 
 the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office   the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell have state that the government respect the icj ’s independence and role but do not think that its ruling of plausible genocide be helpful give the forcible displacement taking place the demolition of home and structure the near famine in gaza and the expansion of illegal settlement in the occupy west bank worsen daily how do the attorney general who have see all this stuff with her own eye propose to uphold international law before it be too late 
 the hon lady and i serve on the justice committee together and i know that she share my deep feeling that we must do everything we can to make sure that international humanitarian law be respect in the region the uk have repeatedly raise with israel the need to limit operation to military target to protect health facility and to avoid harm civilian the prime minister and the foreign secretary have repeatedly raise those matter with their counterpart 
 the uk government ’s less than wholehearte endorsement of the icj process and the international criminal court war crime investigation which be lead by british lawyer mean that the alternative be that people increasingly turn to violence that be the view of the israeli civil society organisation that come to meet we yesterday with the co operation of yachad we have to uphold international law will the attorney general recommit to both those process 
 the hon gentleman have long campaign on these issue so i know that he feel particularly passionately about the region as well i be absolutely happy to commit this government once again to uphold where ever we can international humanitarian law across this house there be a great deal of consensus we want the fighting to stop now we be call for an immediate pause to get aid in and the hostage out and   then to progress to a permanent ceasefire we applaud the part of the icj ’s provisional measure order that call for exactly that 
 it be week since the icj issue its interim ruling on israel ’s conduct in gaza the netanyahu government have fail to comply with that ruling and we be still wait for the uk government to urge they to do so will the attorney general today call on israel to take the step it be order to take by the court 
 we do not feel that that case be particularly helpful at this moment in the negotiation we absolutely respect the icj i have appear there myself and we of course understand that the interim measure order be bind on the party as i say to   the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter element of that order be extremely sensible and we wholeheartedly respect they we call as the icj have do for aid to go in and the hostage to come out immediately that be the right way to proceed if we be ever to achieve a permanent ceasefire and ultimately a resolution of this dreadful conflict however we do not think term such as genocide without a formal final ruling of the court be particularly helpful to use 
 i welcome the attorney general ’s strong condemnation of settler violence against bedouin community in the occupied palestinian territories and i also welcome the sanction recently impose on some of those involve in the violence base on her recent visit do she think that there be a need to go far and sanction those extremist israeli politician who be encourage the violent and illegal expansion of settlement 
 when i visit the region with   the hon member for york central rachael maskell   many year ago we see some of the action of settler in the occupy territory so far as i be able to i reprise that visit when i go to the region most recently and i be surprised at the difference in the level of violence use i be able to visit a bedouin village and talk to those who feel that at a very difficult time for the farming community during lamb they be be push off their land i listen very carefully to what the hon gentleman say and i reassure he that the government continue to keep this issue under review 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i welcome the attorney general ’s comment i think every of we share the desire for the fighting to stop and respect for the international court of justice however do she agree that it be important to be careful when we use legal term in broad political debate for example the test of plausibility in the jurisprudence of the international court of justice be essentially about the admissibility of a claim rather than its ultimate merit the court itself have describe that in a judgment involve myanmar as a low threshold it be important not to make more of a preliminary finding than we should before final litigation be complete 
 as ever the chairman of the select committee make a very important point and may i take this opportunity to congratulate he from   the dispatch box on become an honorary kc which i understand will happen on monday i be sure that the whole house will want to join i in say that he be extremely worthy of this very significant honour and we be all thrill that it will be give he do make an important point word really matter there will shortly be a statement to the house about that and about the meaning of the term extremism it be very important that we all choose our word carefully particularly when it come to this long run and difficult conflict we respect the ruling of the icj of course we do but that do not mean that we think every case before it be well bring 
 on the issue of international convention treaty and international law include international humanitarian law and the international refugee convention will the attorney general place in the library over the weekend a legal statement on the circumstance in which international law be trump by clear and unambiguous word in an act of parliament will she include in that statement the necessary citation from the supreme court and the house of lords 
 my hon friend be a great and long stand member of this house and be able to ask question the answer to which might not automatically be obvious we be talk here about palestinian and israeli counterpart be in compliance with international law but i be of course delight to say again to my hon friend that this government be commit to international law we have say that repeatedly from the dispatch box and i do not see any need to lay a statement such as he suggest but i will continue to enjoy our conversation on this topic 
 this week in the other place the foreign secretary say on the tragic conflict in the middle east 
 you have to obey the rule and obey the law”.—[official report house of lords   march vol c. 
 that be an important affirmation from this government that israel both have a right to self defence and very much have a duty to obey international humanitarian law can the attorney general reaffirm that the government will continue to stress both that right and that duty in this conflict which we all want to end as soon as possible 
 my hon friend make an excellent point and i would not like any member of this house to be in any doubt we all across this house want the fighting to stop now that message be deliver by the government on behalf of the house and the nation repeatedly and loudly we be call for an immediate pause to get aid in and hostage out and then progress to a permanent ceasefire we need thing to happen the release of the hostage the formation of a new palestinian government hamas ’s capacity to launch attack stop hamas to no long be in charge of gaza and a credible pathway to a state solution i think we can all get behind that 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to improve the experience of victim of crime 
 the crown prosecution service be transform the way that it support victim the victim transformation programme will roll out this spring under it for example every rape victim will receive an invitation to meet their prosecution team before their case go to trial 
 the tension result from the conflict in israel and gaza be cause an escalation in hate crime what progress be my hon and learn friend make alongside the cps to ensure that the victim of these crime indeed the victim of any hate crime receive full support and that the perpetrator be prosecute 
 my hon friend raise the absolutely key point which be the support give to victim the programme that the cps be roll out include a programme for close work between the police and the cps to support victim he will be pleased to know that in the rolling year to september the cps prosecute hate crime offence with a charge rate of and a conviction rate of and in of those case the judge increase the offender ’s sentence because they agree that it be a hate crime 
 do the minister agree that some of the most tragic case be those in which a family member be murder in that context could coroner court and the coroner system be modernise the time that some of my constituent have to wait because of coroner court delay be unacceptable 
 the hon member raise a key point there be nothing more tragic than the circumstance he outline i be happy to meet he to talk about any specific case concern he have but more broadly i be acutely aware of the pressure and i will look at whether there be anything i can do to ensure that the pressure and stress on his constituent be alleviate 
 i call the shadow attorney general 
 i be absolutely certain that the attorney general and the solicitor general will have be as shock as i be to read this week ’s report by researcher at warwick university on the recent handling of rape case by the cps in far too many area the picture it paint be simply appalling poor communication poor quality control poor decision making outdated attitude stereotype and victim blaming add to the constant problem of staff be overwork and under resource the positive be that it be the cps that commission the report in the place it have not shy away from the finding and researcher be clear that the roll out of operation soteria will take thing in the right direction do the law officer agree that we simply can not leave thing there will they undertake to come back to the house with an action plan base on the finding of this report and a clear timetable for its implementation 
 i be grateful to the right hon lady for raise that i be horrify by a great number of the finding there be clearly a lot of work here thing be clearly move in the right direction and much of the work be undertake by the cps be on liaise with victim and ensure that their experience   be as easy as possible in the hugely traumatic circumstance there be a lot more to do on joint working but i be happy to continue liaise with she in order to update she as this go forward 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to improve the experience of victim of crime in kettering constituency 
 my hon friend will be pleased to hear that cps east midlands be now make charge decision for rape case more quickly in and the area be perform well than the national average on reduce victim attrition 
 i thank the crown prosecution service for the work it do in prosecute offender and seek justice for victim in kettering what overall assessment have the solicitor general make of the effectiveness of the cps across the east midland 
 the attorney general visit the cps east midlands office in leicester just last month and she tell i that she be impressed to hear about the work that prosecutor have be undertake to tackle recent and historical instance of child sexual abuse in particular secure lengthy sentence for the perpetrator that be an excellent example of the importance of joint working between prosecutor and the police which i have refer to 
 rise 
 be you the shadow mp for kettering or something i hope this be link to the question 
 i welcome the minister ’s answer the minister be responsible not only for kettering and the east midland but for the united kingdom what one- to support can be offer to victim of sexual crime across the united kingdom to improve their experience of the criminal justice system 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on his ingenuity in manage to squeeze that in that be an excellent bit of order paper operation i be happy to meet he to talk about what we be do in his area to smooth the experience of victim of crime who have   to go through the criminal justice system they have suffer trauma already the system should not add to that 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to prosecute people for the trafficking of vulnerable adult and child into the uk 
 the cps have specially train prosecutor who work closely with law enforcement agency to bring to justice those who commit the heinous crime to which the hon lady refer the cps have for example recently obtain conviction in the prosecution for traffic people for organ   harvesting that present many complex and difficult challenge and i commend the team in the cps for their work on that 
 last year the number of potential uk victim of modern slavery reach a record level with referral for woman and child both at all time high in the average wait for a decision in modern slavery case be day in it be day modern slavery be get bad not well and now the uk government be actively make progress on seek to strip people of modern slavery protection when will the government accept that this be a crisis and take the urgent action need 
 the hon lady be quite right to draw attention to the seriousness of this crime but the government accept the urgency which be why for example we have the cps available to provide early advice to law enforcement in exactly the case that she refer to we have specialist prosecutor provide that advice so that we have the right advice and the right charge against the right people at the right time 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 even in freeze condition at the start of the year thousand more man woman and child cross the channel in small boat for all the talk that the threat of deportation to rwanda will act as a deterrent there be no evidence whatsoever of that deterrent work perhaps that be why the government have change tack and plan a £ incentive for refugee to get on plane to rwanda do the solicitor general now accept that the only way to stop the boat be to crush the trafficking gang and prosecute the criminal 
 the hon gentleman be quite right that the country face a major challenge from the cruel people smuggle gang who be exploit people financially and emotionally we have to put an end to that the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill have pass through this house but there will be further opportunity for debate on its return here what he have underline be how important it be that we take action i agree and that be what we be do 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 last week the prime minister ’s flagship rwanda bill be defeat time in the house of lords with call for the uk government to protect victim of modern slavery and human trafficking from be remove to rwanda without their consent until a decision base on conclusive ground about their safety and not be place at risk of be re trafficked have be complete do the solicitor general not understand that modern slavery protection for vulnerable child and adult appear to be expendable under his government 
 the bill will be come back to the commons next week when there will be an opportunity to debate those issue far however i point out that the treaty between the government of rwanda and the uk include specific provision that address the need for protection and support for victim of trafficking 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs on uk compliance with international humanitarian law in the context of the international court of justice ’s order in the case on the application of the genocide convention in gaza 
 regular at attorney general ’s question know that the law officer convention prevent i from disclose outside government whether or not i have provide advice and the specific of that advice colleague also know that i take seriously my obligation to ensure that the government be act in a lawful manner on both domestic and international front 
 i have listen to the attorney general and she will know that the uk government as a signatory to the genocide convention have a clear responsibility not only to punish but under article to undertake to prevent genocide as of the grave crime under international law give that the government will still sell arm to the israeli military after the international court of justice find the action in gaza to be plausibly in breach of the genocide convention what legal advice have she provide to the foreign office that allow she to fulfil the legal obligation to prevent genocide at the same time as sell arm if the icj ultimately rule that it be genocide and it be prove that civilian have be kill by uk sell arm do that not leave the uk complicit in genocide 
 i believe that i deal early with the substance of the hon gentleman ’s question we respect the independence of the icj we have considerable concern about this case which be not helpful in the goal of achieve a sustainable ceasefire we accept that the court have make a provisional measure order much of which we wholeheartedly agree with we would suggest however that term such as genocide not be bandy about until there have be a final ruling of the court interruption the hon gentleman ask from a sedentary position what advice i have provide i have explain clearly why i can not answer that however with your leave mr speaker i will take he through some of the foreign commonwealth and development office ’s decision make process to inform the department for business and trade on export licensing 
 the fcdo continue to assess israel ’s commitment and capability to comply with ihl the assessment be support by a detailed evidence base include analysis of the conflict report from ngos international body and partner country statement from the israeli government and military representative and israel ’s track record we have ask the government of israel specific question on their approach to comply with ihl i do some of that myself to help inform that advice application for export licence be assess on a case by case basis against strategic export licensing criterion include with regard to ihl that be a major part of that assessment we keep licence under careful and continue review the government can amend suspend refuse or revoke licence as circumstance require

 i pay tribute to tommy mcavoy the former member for rutherglen tommy be a legend of the labour whips office and the long ever serve government whip he be highly respected and revere my thought be with his family and friend 
 despite the king ’s speech be only a few month ago the government seem to be run scared from their own legislative programme where have all their flagship bills go we hear that the renters reform bill be be hold to ransom on the brink of collapse because the government will not stand up to landlord on their own side and end no fault eviction reading and committee stage happen in november but there have be nothing since that be a manifesto commitment so when will we get report stage if the government do not end no fault eviction we will 
 the prime minister ’s personal pledge to much fanfare of a smokefree generation also seem to have go up in smoke where be the bill we have offer the government labour ’s vote and they should take they the victims and prisoners bill be languish in the lords be that because the government do not want the amendment table by my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   on infected   blood to be agree to if that be so it be pretty shameful will the leader of the house promise government support for the amend bill when will we finally see detail of the compensation scheme 
 the sentencing bill be also stick in limbo we have be wait for week for its committee stage be it another victim of this wear out government apparently the justice secretary and the prime minister be at loggerhead over how to proceed while this week the government sneak out further plan to release criminal early because they have lose control of prison place be that not exactly what member should be scrutinise during the passage of the bill will the leader of the house bring it back 
 much need and long herald legislation to regulate english football be still nowhere to be see just this week the premier league shelve a new financial settlement for the football pyramid and the english football league be respond today do the leader of the house not agree that new power to impose a fair deal for small club can not come soon enough fan in bury macclesfield derby reading scunthorpe and may i add portsmouth want their precious club save if the conservatives want to make this an election issue in those place i say bring it on let we be really clear if they do not want to regulate football governance then we will 
 i notice the leader of the house have not announce any further provision beyond monday for ping pong on the emergency rwanda legislation be that because it have now be push back to after easter some emergency to be honest i do not want to hear as parliamentary time allow when there be an abundance of it do we really need time on the floor of the house for so many statutory instrument or committee stage of the pedicabs london bill the government have the time but on those issue and more they do not have the support of their own side it be as if they do not have the number with every week that pass their majority get small and small this week it be another defection but the reason for their dwindle number do not make for pretty reading in no particular order tractor porn drug abuse a conviction for paedophilia break parliamentary rule on pay lobbying groping mislead parliament flash at staff tantrum because they be not give peerage and eat camel penis it might sound ridiculous but it be actually not funny it all bring parliament into disrepute and drag our politic through the gutter 
 and now this week we have have overt racism from the conservative party ’s big donor i have to check for myself yesterday that the prime minister really say that he be pleased”—he be pleased that this man who say a black woman mp should be shoot and that indians should climb on the roof of train support his party be the leader of the house please will she use his resource in her marginal portsmouth north constituency surely if he be a racist which he clearly be he have no place in the conservative party and his money should be give back 
 the truth be that the conservatives can not implement their own legislative programme they have lose control as   the hon member for broxbourne sir charles walker   say last night 
 the conservative party be unleadable and for the sake of the nation it ’ well to go early than allow this psychodrama to continue 
 he ’ right be n’t he 
 may i start by wish all who be mark it in the uk and around the world a bless ramadan i join the tribute pay by   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   to tommy mcavoy i be sure many member will pay tribute to he in the come day and week i also thank my right hon friend   the member for maidenhead mrs may   for her service and friendship over many year this house may be lose she but i know she have many more year of public service ahead of she 
 the hon member for manchester central focus on the legislative programme she will know that bills have already be introduce in this session and that have reach royal assent she will know that last session we do bills and break many record in term of private member bills and the amount of legislation we be able to get through she will know the passage of the bills that be go through both houses at the moment and she will also know that we will shortly bring through a bill on football governance this be a programme of work that we initiate follow a review that be conduct with the help of many club around the country when we bring legislation to the house it will need to have the confidence of the english football league and have attend many event with the efl myself i know that that be clear and understand 
 the hon lady claim that the conservatives have no energy leave for legislation suggest that we be not bring measure forward and that we be a zombie parliament but i be afraid that it be the opposition who be the zombie in this chamber the house rise early when the opposition be not oppose the committee stage of the finance bill be complete in minute and in recent time the opposition have find it hard even to find speaker for their own debate it be they who be display zombie tendency it be often tempting to refer to the leader of the opposition as the knight of the living dead and in stark contrast i commend the always energetic and vibrant stance take by my hon friend   the member for broxbourne sir charles walker i think the point he be make in that interview be that the plan be work 
 let i now come to the very serious issue that the hon lady raise about mr hester ’s remark they be racist and abhorrent and i fully appreciate threaten to   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott who i understand have refer the matter to the police 
 my party be finance by fundraising and donation notably money raise from raffle include donation from private individual there might be some who would come to this dispatch box today and attempt to argue that such a refund be not practically possible or warrant but i be not go to attempt to do that the point that the hon lady have make be not concerned with the practicality of a refund the consequence to the payroll of conservative campaign headquarters or the ability of my party to fight a general election no no it be a point of principle and i respect that she could not have be clear in what she have say today she have state that it be wrong to take fund from people who say horrible thing no matter when they be say and that when there be an issue fund should be return she have be clear about that today and she have say that that be the right thing to do 
 if for example someone say of hamas that man ’s terrorist be another man ’s freedom fighter as dale vince have say or say that my colleague and i should be take out and shoot as the rmt union boss steve hedley have say the hon lady would presumably think it wrong to hang on to fund donate to labour by they or by an organisation brand institutionally sexist i believe that during tim roache ’s time as gmb general secretary when he run what have be describe as a cast couch culture”—menace young woman in the union the labour party take quid from he 
 those charmer alone have contribute £ to the labour party and presumably immediately follow this session the hon lady will demand that it be repay to be precise and to assist she in that matter let i add that those donation be make directly to the central labour party labour mps member of the scottish parliament councillor the mayor of manchester she might like to mention that this weekend the deputy leader of the labour party and the leader of the opposition 
 if labour be sincere and this it be not a political stunt it will commit itself to repay those fund and there would be some additional upside to do so the scurrilous suggestion that labour ’s pro stop oil policy be anything to do with mr vince ’s donation could no long be deploy and nor could the charge that labour members would not support our legislation to protect the public ’s access to the service they pay for because their party be in the pocket of militant trade union but i be not hold my breath because i know that labour member say thing and do another they have drop their £ decarbonisation spending pledge yet they keep the policy they say that they will not tolerate pro genocide chant yet they have restore the whip to   the hon member for middlesbrough andy mcdonald they say that they back our tax cut but they will not vote for they and as a consequence they now can not say how they would fund nhs appointment breakfast club nhs equipment dentistry appointment home insulation their own state own energy company and their wealth fund no amount of confected drama and virtue signalling can disguise the fact that it be the same old labour party the same old hypocrisy and the same old game 
 this week in the real world outside the westminster bubble which be where we be focused cancer death among middle aged people be down by a revise forecast show that the economy be grow and for the month in a row real wage be rise the plan be work unlike labour ’s line of attack and my hon friend the member for broxbourne be very excited about it 
 i call the father of the house 
 it be good to hear inclusive politic may i ask the leader of the house whether follow consultation there might be a statement before or after easter on inclusivity in parliament we rightly want to embrace and value difference and diversity whether of a person ’s race gender other characteristic background or experience the word that be miss be sex 
 over the last year those who be gender critical have raise all sort of issue include the constant use of puberty blocker for child and the attack on the   lgb alliance for not swallow what stonewall and mermaids persuade many government departments and agency to do which be to disregard sex completely 
 while want to support trans people and make sure that they can have a life free from bigotry and fear would it be possible for the house to examine its own policy on inclusiveness and try to ensure that the word sex be include along with the other characteristic for which people should not be discriminate against 
 my hon friend raise a very important point and i know that many member of the house of commons commission will have hear what he have say this be a very important matter when the government have put forward measure for example to protect single sex space which be important and value by many people in this country we have also be reassure about what that mean for trans people and those live in a different gender it be perfectly possible to do both and i think that the house have a further focus on the issue be a very good suggestion 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 may i too wish everyone a happy ramadan and pay my respect to the family of tommy mcavoy 
 well here we be again try to get the answer that the leader of the house do not want to and indeed never do supply to our sticky inconvenient question i will begin with the dream that dare not speak its name here brexit the resolution foundation tell we that the uk ’s good export and import have contract by far more than those of any other g7 country largely due to brexit thing be now so dire in brexitland that even news of a gdp uplift of just be fall upon by brexiteer like starve pigeon on the crust of the stale bread the conservative party aim to shrink suffer public service even far as evidence in last week ’s budget so should there not be some discussion or even a debate about the huge uplift in civil service job that brexit seem to have require since the eu referendum in 
 despite all the glorious promise of strength and environmental protection in this free fair and well off britian we be see green policy abandon right left and centre by both the tory and labour party a hapless minister even try to tell we yesterday that build new gas power plant be good for the environment a suggestion that seem to be support by shadow environment ministers too once again labour present face down here and entirely another up in scotland frustratingly all the warn sign of brexit impact across a huge range of sector come in bit and piece surely what be need be for the government to collate all the impact and present the result to the british people so that they can properly judge whether brexit have be a success can the leader of the house help to facilitate that 
 there be a little good news this week hopefully there will be some proper government redress for victim of the shocking post office horizon scandal although there be still no comfort for the infected blood scandal victim i meet the international consortium of british pensioners recently and i fear that another scandal be about to break in the form of frozen pension there be now so many scandal that it be hard to keep track   something do not work in this place if so many can build up under successive government of different political hue 
 unfortunately the leader of the house ’s party distinguish itself again this week by choose money over morality in its grubby handling of the racist comment allegedly make about of our colleague in this house at the very least a debate to re examine how party be fund be call for 
 the up series be recently deem to be the most influential television series of the last year well year be well and truly up for this terrible government but apparently we can not be put out of our tory misery yet because their junior member have debt and need the extra month to build up some reserve do the leader of the house agree that that be not much of an excuse 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s welcome of the post office horizon system offences bill which i hope her party will support she know that we will shortly bring forward measure to rectify the situation on infected blood these scandal do not arise under this administration but we have grip the issue the infected blood issue have be leave for decade but we have investigate and set up inquiry and be compensate the victim i hope the house will support we in do so on both matter 
 the hon lady insinuate that i dodge question but i do not she say week ago that she would write to i with a list of all the question i have not answer but she have not yet do so the snp never fail to disappoint 
 the hon lady ask about sound administration and about money over morality in a week in which it have be discover that the scottish government have preside over a figure sum of scottish taxpayer money be spend on an art installation that promise a 
 magical erotic journey through a distinctly scottish landscape 
 that be know to the rest of we as a hardcore porn movie 
 i be glad that the snp be interested in good governance and improve administration particularly with reference to brexit let i see how i can help to improve the scottish government ’s effectiveness in that regard there have be criticism this week that the snp be blow taxpayer cash on copious embassy and lobby to rejoin the eu that camper van must be out of the police pound soon so why not turn it into a mobile embassy that can drive between brussels and european capital to lobby for eu membership if the snp want to continue fund innovative film project perhaps it could double up and ask cliff richard to come along and produce a sequel to summer holiday which would have the add bonus of cut down the snp ’s need to blow more taxpayer cash on overseas jolly i be here to help 
 i have a lot of time for   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell but i need to clear my name i stride across victoria tower gardens yesterday to put my boot into my miserabilist colleague who be demand an early general election i say to gary gibbon that with income rise inflation fall the economy grow and the plan work why   may i be roll up my sleeve to man the rampart in november 
 my question be can we have an urgent debate on foot in mouth disease 
 foot in mouth or foot and mouth

 the committee be still open for application for westminster hall debate on tuesday morning and thursday afternoon after the easter recess but we be a little disappointed that we have not be allocate a little more chamber time before the recess 
 the cost of childcare be a significant barrier to work for many parent and the increase in fund place will be welcome but with the phase come into effect in april many parent be report difficulty in obtain the promise fund place and very significant cost increase for the non funded element can we have a debate in government time on the impact of the phase of the scheme on the accessibility and affordability of the scheme and on whether the scheme as it currently stand will effectively remove the childcare barrier to work and fulfil its promise to parent 
 i thank the hon gentleman for all the work he be do for his committee i hear his appeal for more time and i will soon be able to give he some information about that 
 as for our childcare policy this be a priority for the secretary of state for education and i will make sure that she have hear his concern today it be of the many element we be bring forward to enable people to remain economically active and grow their household income it be a very important service which be why have do this it be an unprecedented generous package for parent and we must ensure that all parent who want to access it can do so
