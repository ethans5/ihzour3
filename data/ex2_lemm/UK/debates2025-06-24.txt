 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support the provision of medical aid in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help ensure that humanitarian aid be deliver to gaza 
 israel must immediately allow rapid and unhindered aid into gaza the foreign secretary raise the humanitarian situation with israeli foreign minister sa’ar on sunday we recently announce £ of further uk humanitarian support for gazans and we will continue to urge israel to lift restriction on humanitarian aid to allow the un and other aid organisation to operate safely and independently 
 this morning i hear from my medical colleague dr rebecca inglis of healthcare workers watch that a gp in gaza be kill by israeli soldier shoot in the head mr speaker he be just of healthcare worker who have be murder by israeli force countless other have be unlawfully detain and torture israel be deliberately destroy the palestinian healthcare system will the minister please raise these issue with his israeli counterpart 
 i can confirm that i have raise these issue with my israeli counterpart it be appal that hundred of healthcare worker have reportedly be kill since the start of the conflict we continue to urge the israeli authority to ensure that incident be investigate transparently and that those responsible be hold to account and lesson learn healthcare worker premise and facility must be protect allow medical staff to do their work 
 more than palestinians have be kill in recent week as israeli force have open fire on those attempt to collect aid from the gaza humanitarian foundation the people of gaza not only face daily risk from bomb and bullet but the ever present danger of man make drought and famine will the government commit to use all resource at their disposal include further sanction and an arm embargo to ensure that aid be deliver to gaza under the auspex of the un and other suitably qualified body 
 the killing of civilian at aid distribution centre in gaza be horrify israel must fulfil its obligation under international law to ensure unhindered humanitarian assistance i will not speculate about future sanction or arm embargo but we continue to engage with our partner and will not hesitate to take further action if the government of israel do not change course 
 mussa abu darabi be just of hundred of palestinians who have be kill try to access food from the gaza humanitarian foundation in recent week international human right organisation have now warn that the ghf may face legal consequence for 
 aid and abetting or otherwise be complicit in crime under international law include war crime crime against humanity or genocide 
 will the minister join i in condemn the murder of desperate and starve people what assessment do he make of the ghf ’s legality 
 no should risk death or injury to feed their family as i say in this house on   june israel ’s aid delivery measure be inhumane we will not support any mechanism that endanger civilian we have continually call on israel include most recently on sunday immediately to allow the un and aid partner to safely deliver all type of aid at scale 
 on occasion in answer this question the minister have say that israel must what will he do if israel do not 
 as the right hon gentleman know this government have take a series of action in response to development in gaza we will continue to take such action until the situation change 
 what be the government ’s assessment of how effectively medical aid can be deliver to those in need in gaza include the remain israeli hostage 
 aid can be deliver effectively into gaza there be establish mechanism through the united nations and its partner and we want to see those mechanism in place the hon gentleman raise the vital question of ensure that the hostage themselves get sufficient access to food both my right hon friend the foreign secretary and i have hear directly from eli sharabi a release hostage who have talk about hamas ’s deprivation of food from the hostage that must stop and they must immediately release all hostage 
 my constituent have watch in horror as israeli force have reportedly kill more than palestinians and injure thousand more at aid distribution centre in gaza over the weekend dozen more palestinians be kill while try to access humanitarian aid why be the government still permit the transfer of f-35 component to israel through the international pool know that these aircraft may be use in operation cause mass civilian casualty 
 we have set out the reason why the government have have to take special measure to ensure that the f-35 programme continue to operate which include our continue role in the global spare pool in the united states however i agree with the sentiment of the hon lady ’s constituent the death around aid distribution centre be clearly horrify and there need to be a full investigation and action take vitally aid must get into gaza at the scale require and from enough distribution centre in order to avoid the horrifying scene that we have see 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 we must not forget gaza despite the eye of the world now be turn to the iran israel war it be important that we continue to remember the suffering of the gazans and continue to move on it as a witness from médecins sans frontières say to my committee there be lethal chaos in gaza there be read across from the iran israel war that i think we should learn from the clear closeness between israel and america and the fact that america can influence israel i ask the minister to ensure that we continue to say in our conversation with the americans not to give up on gaza and to use their influence to ensure that the israelis do the right thing there must be peace and the hostage must come home 
 this government will not give up on gaza i can confirm that the foreign secretary have raise gaza in his engagement with the us i have not forget about gaza and be speak to palestinian counterpart just last night the situation in gaza will remain a top priority for this government 
 israel deal with hamas and hezbollah be to be welcome but the continue blockage on medical and humanitarian aid go into gaza be not welcome as we continue to talk child continue to die i hope that the foreign secretary will make it very clear that the continuation of child die every single day be unacceptable and that he will   stand up to the white house the state department and the pentagon and to the knesset and the current israeli government of netanyahu these death be just go on and on and on how many more child need to die before something change 
 as i have say the foreign secretary have raise these issue with both his american and israeli counterpart and i have do the same we remain steely in our focus on the situation in gaza include the tragic scene around the deprivation of aid and the impact that be have on civilian right across the strip include child we be try to take every measure we can to reduce that suffering that include aid where it can be bring in aid into the region where that be the most appropriate way to reach the medically vulnerable and in a few small case ensure that gazan child can access medical assistance here 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the humanitarian situation in gaza simply can not continue we have spend a lot of time in this house discuss the extent of that situation and the fact that food and essential supply be not get through to support innocent victim what proposal have the minister put to israel about the opening of specific crossing point for aid delivery into gaza will he give his assessment of why the israeli government may not be listen to this country and our government on this particular issue 
 the disagreement that the israeli government have be not simply with the british government it be with a wide range of their partner as the right hon lady be aware we sign a statement with partner about the humanitarian situation we make a leader level statement with france and canada there be wide disagreement with the approach that the israeli government be take in relation to aid distribution at the weekend the foreign secretary discuss these matter include entry point with the foreign minister of israel we would like to see the israeli government shift position it be clear for the reason that she say that that shift must come urgently

 on   june the minister sanction israeli ministers who advocate for the blockade of gaza note that that would not remove hamas or ensure that the hostage be release but nothing have change what further step be the government take today to signal to the government of israel that the uk will not stand idly by while child in gaza be starve deny medicine or kill as they seek food for their family

 i see for myself the impact of russia ’s barbarism in kyiv and chernihiv last month and i hear directly from some of the brave ukrainians who have be subject to war crime in yahidne there be a lot go on in the world at the moment but what assurance can the foreign secretary give the house and those ukrainians wait to be able to go home that he be strain every sinew so that russia pay for its crime and war crime 
 our support be iron clad the hon lady will have see our continue package of sanction on russia and will recognise that this issue will be central to our discussion at nato later on today and tomorrow whether it be at the g7 nato or weimar+ the uk continue to lead on this critical issue not just for ukraine but for european security 
 will the foreign secretary consider further sanction on the russian regime for the force deportation of ukrainian child in recent peace talk the russian delegation propose an exchange of prisoner of war for ukrainian child who have be steal from their home thereby equate combatant with child who receive special protect status under international law be that not horrific do the foreign secretary share my concern that ukrainian child be expect to attend summer camp in russia this summer from which they be unlikely to return to their home 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for continue to prosecute this issue and for raise it at every opportunity it be a heinous crime we have already sanction some of the individual who lie behind it   i will not comment on future sanction but we be of course keep this under full consideration it will be a topic of discussion with both ukrainian foreign ministers and nato ministers later today 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 ukraine have bravely fight back putin ’s illegal invasion and that be with our undoubted support will the foreign secretary give an update on what action be under way to release the billion of pound of frozen russian asset on the subject of russian threat and malign influence he will be alarmed to know that the political opposition leader in georgia have be arrest and imprison this week what step be the government take in response and will further sanction be consider to curtail putin ’s absolute abuse of democracy in europe 
 the minister responsible for europe my hon friend   the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty have condemn what take place in georgia over the last few day and i endorse that condemnation on the issue of russian asset we be engage particularly with european colleague who be more exposed than we be it have be right to allow new government in europe to take their place and consider these issue because they require some technical understanding but we continue to press this issue and it will be a topic at the nato summit later today

 the foreign secretary previously tell the house that germany and belgium be the blocker to international agreement on seize frozen russian asset will he set out how he and the prime minister will raise this proposal with his belgian and german counterpart at the nato summit have he consider replicate the eu ’s proposal to extract billion of euros more from those asset by move they into high yield investment 
 it be important to recognise that the european union have just come forward with a new sanction package its i congratulate it on that give that as the hon member will recognise country like hungary have be backmarker and blocker on this issue he have hear what i have say on russian asset it have be important for new government to be able to consider these thing afresh and get up to technical speed the way forward must be to pool those asset so that all of we bear joint liability as it be the discussion continue apace 
 what step his department be take to protect the right of woman and girl globally 
 we be steadfast in our support for woman and girl the appointment of baroness harman as special envoy underscore that commitment we be focus much of our effort on the most marginalised woman and girl who be disproportionately affect by ongoing conflict and crisis for example through food assistance to displace people on the chad sudan border almost of whom be woman and child 
 yesterday we welcome an ambitious and much need industrial strategy which will rely on bold trade deal with country around the world britain have a strong tradition of promote human right in its work around the world how be the fcdo ensure that we uphold our commitment to right for girl and woman as we develop trade deal with other country 
 we be use our influence to unlock the full potential of woman to participate in the economy that include work to include gender provision in newly negotiate free trade agreement and we be support woman lead business to realise the benefit of trade the develop country trading scheme provide for tariff which disproportionately support small woman lead business in low income country 
 i should like to know what step the foreign office be take to protect woman and girl in this country there can be no well candidate for deportation than non uk national who have violently rap child here after the casey report into the gang scandal last week ministers promise that they would do everything they could to deport the man involve will the foreign secretary confirm that he have already tell pakistan that british aid and diplomatic visa will be withdraw if convict rapist be not take back 
 minister have you get something on that question 
 it be probably a question for the home office but we in the foreign office will do anything we can to support victim and bring people to justice 
 i call the shadow minister 
 education be a basic right and ensure quality education for every girl be essential to build a more equitable world in the conservative government launch the woman and girl strategy to deliver on the es education empower woman and girl and end violence do the minister stand by the commitment to ensure that at least of aid reach woman and girl most importantly will she confirm the official development assistance spending for global education follow the spending review 
 we be commit to support woman in all that we do we be support for example displace child with education intervention in sudan and reach sudanese refugee population in country through £ of funding for education   can not wait which the right hon member may know from her time as a minister be that of the programme she cut uk support through the international finance facility for education will unlock up to $ in additional and affordable education our equality impact assessment will be publish shortly so that she can analyse the exact pound and penny 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the government ’s policy on arm trade with israel 
 the uk operate of the most robust export control regime in the world of our act in government be to review and suspend export licence that could be use by the israel defence forces in gaza we have successfully implement that suspension and have continue to refuse relevant licence application all export licence be keep under careful and continual review and we can suspend refuse or revoke licence as require 
 the war criminal of benjamin netanyahu ’s government be carry out the most vile human right abuse and genocide at the same time the uk carry out the training of israeli military personnel and facilitate almost daily spy flight that provide intelligence and there be continue export of military equipment to israel with all that will the government support an independent public inquiry into uk involvement in israeli military operation in gaza 
 it be important to be focus on the fact at issue we do not support spy flight we have a limited presence to try and find hostage in gaza for reason that the whole house would understand and support there be few than idf personnel receive any training in the uk and that training be academic and non military in nature we be not arm israel ’s war in gaza we categorically do not export any bomb or ammunition for use in military operation in gaza 
 my hon friend ask about an independent inquiry the government welcome scrutiny and i welcome my time in this chamber on the question at issue on arm sale include on the f-35 programme there be a judicial review on which we will hear finding shortly there be plenty of scrutiny of this government 
 will the government let we know what assessment they have make of israel ’s stockpile of nuclear weapon 
 the hon gentleman will understand why i will not comment on those issue from the dispatch box 
 what assessment he have make of the contribution of water sanitation and hygiene project to achieve the government ’s international development objective 
 our work on water sanitation and hygiene help deliver development objective on global health climate and growth we support country in africa and asia to develop climate resilient water sanitation and hygiene service and prevent the spread of disease include cholera we be work through the world bank and the global challenge programme on water to reach with water service by 
 recent polling by wateraid and yougov show that access to water sanitation and hygiene be the no priority that the uk public want to see fund through uk aid that make sense give that water underpin global health keep girl in school and build climate resilient community do the minister agree that it be of the smart and most cost effective way to deliver the uk ’s development goal without access to safe water sanitation and hygiene there can be no meaningful progress in any of those area 
 the hon gentleman make important point i have the pleasure of see many important water and sanitation project in my previous career we be concentrate on maintain our impact by focus on partnership with government and multilateral and establish the condition that can secure additional domestic funding and private investment in those area he rightly make the link between water and sanitation and health and that will be consider as we approach future funding allocation 
 what change be make to the draft agreement to transfer sovereignty over the chagos island to mauritius between october and may 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the treaty with mauritius on the transfer of sovereignty of the chagos archipelago on the uk 
 how much and what proportion of the funding due to be allocate to mauritius as part of the agreement concern the chagos archipelago will come from his department 
 the diego garcia military base deal secure the future of the strategically critical us uk military base it will protect our national security for generation and ensure we maintain vital capability it be our most significant contribution to the transatlantic defence and security partnership it have be strengthen since our agreement with the previous mauritian government and indeed from the deal under discussion by the previous government the payment will be split between the fcdo and the ministry of defence and publish in the usual way the opposition understand the jeopardy face the base and the necessity of the treaty which be why they start negotiate in the place 
 the foreign secretary be an old friend and the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs   the hon member for lincoln mr falconer be a lincolnshire neighbour whom in all his innocence i regard with a degree of paternal care so i ask this question more in sorrow than in anger the assumption root in the government ’s statement be that unless we do a deal with mauritius the international telecommunication union could decide that mauritius be sovereign and deny access to both the us and the uk that be fundamentally untrue the itu have no competence in that regard and it be ignore by the us already so will the minister confirm that that argument be entirely bogus this be not a deal this be not diplomacy it be a disgrace 
 i thoroughly reject that statement by the right hon gentleman he know that i have a lot of respect for he but i be afraid that he be completely mistaken on this the fact be that the court be already make decision that undermine our position legally bind provisional measure could have come within week affect the operational ability of the base to function as it be and we believe that an inevitable bind judgment would have follow the deal have be do and this house be now scrutinise it i have appear before committees in recent week and of course there will be further such scrutiny over the week ahead 
 if the us want to launch an attack on iran from diego garcia in the current circumstance would the uk government support it 
 as the foreign secretary have make absolutely clear there be no uk involvement in the us strike on iran the hon gentleman will understand that we do not comment on private conversation with our ally or on hypothetical operation 
 i have hop for a more precise answer to my question rather than press again for exact figure or a departmental breakdown let i proceed down a related line of inquiry be there any mechanism legal or otherwise that the mauritian government could use to reopen the chagos negotiation or to request further financial or material assistance in a way that could result in additional cost to the british taxpayer 
 i have set out the cost very clearly they average out at £ over the course of the deal that compare very favourably with for example what france pay for its military facility in djibouti this treaty have be enter into in good faith by the uk and mauritius it will be legally binding and we be absolutely clear that it be compliant with international law and all our other obligation 
 when the foreign affairs committee be in washington recently we raise the diego garcia deal with the administration they could not have be more enthusiastic for this deal because they recognise that it secure our strategic interest in the area do the minister agree that it be perhaps time for conservative members to stop play politic with national defence 
 i could not agree more this deal be support by the united states by our eyes partner and by india it secure our national security the security of our ally and the base well into the next century as i have say many time if there be not a problem why do the previous government start negotiate 
 i call the shadow minister 
 labour ’s surrender of british sovereignty have be welcome by china russia and iran and now we learn that the uk will have to notify mauritius of any military operation come from diego garcia jeopardise our national security far from uphold our international obligation this treaty be a shameful betrayal of british chagossians with no guarantee of access to the mauritian control £ trust fund and british taxpayer fork out £ to subsidise tax cut in mauritius why will the government not allow this house a proper debate and a vote before next week ’s day deadline under the constitutional reform and governance act should we not keep the chagos island british and under the protection of the crown would that not be a well policy 
 half of the hon gentleman ’s question be rhetoric and half of it be completely wrong he might want to consider correct the record on a number of point we do not have to inform mauritius before undertake military action from the base that relate to expedition information after action so there be no fettering of our ability to operate from there the cost he quote be simply wrong it be £ average over the course of the deal and the net present value of the payment be £ all sort of wild figure have be post around but they do not reflect the reality this have be consider by the government actuary i would really have hop give the wide geopolitical threat that this country and our ally face at the moment that he would come up with some more serious question 
 what step he be take to strengthen the uk ’s relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia 
 the united kingdom and saudi arabia be historic ally with a modern partnership i meet his highness prince faisal bin farhan immediately after the israeli strike signify the significant strength and trust in the relationship the prime minister visit riyadh for his strategic partnership council with his royal highness the crown prince where he commit to an ambitious programme of co operation and enhance mutual prosperity 
 i declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on saudi arabia saudi arabia be an important partner for trade and peace in the middle east and for the combating of terrorism around the world with reference to recent event in iran how be the foreign secretary utilise our relationship to involve the saudi government in our de escalation effort in the region 
 i have find it hugely beneficial to be able to speak to his highness prince faisal so closely over the last few day at the outbreak of this crisis and then again in the last hour we stay in close touch and saudi arabia be a key ally of course we be worried about how the situation would affect regional ally like saudi arabia there be so much that we can do together not just on security but on trade our trade have grow by and we remain committed to grow our total trade to £ by 
 the creation of the abraham accord be of the achievement of the trump administration and the president of the us have say that he aim for the kingdom of saudi arabia to join those accord what be the uk government do to encourage that process and what precondition do he believe riyadh have for join the accord 
 the right hon gentleman raise a good question we should remember when think about   october   that of the objective of hamas be to tear apart the prospect of normalisation in the region notwithstanding the horror and pain of the crisis in the region over these last month the abraham accord and israel ’s change relationship with so many gulf partner in particular but also other muslim country be important to keep hold of we continue to discuss these issue but there be no prospect until we get to a ceasefire 
 what step his department be take to provide assistance to british national impact by conflict in the middle east 
 the safety of british national be our priority we be provide support and advice to more than british national as they seek to leave the region by land and air we have deploy team to israel cyprus egypt and jordan our embassy in tehran have be temporarily withdraw but continue to provide support to british national in iran remotely we have bolster team in neighbouring country to support british national seek to get to safety when israeli airspace open yesterday we run our raf evacuation flight and i can confirm to the house now that we will fly another today 
 british national in israel include the daughter of my constituent remain concerned about their safety the advice have be for british citizen to make their way to egypt via the border but there have be some report that the israeli government have suggest those journey would be unsafe can the minister clarify the advice to british citizen in that situation 
 travel advice be the good source of advice for british national in israel there be option for leave by land as my hon friend ’s constituent be aware there be now option for leave by air as well but as he and the whole house will understand the flow of flight out of israel remain limited british   national in israel will want to make their own judgment about whether they want to wait for a flight or make a land journey and my official be available to advise every constituent on the option before they 
 of my constituent be currently in tehran but they say that fuel shortage long queue and poor internet access as well as closed airspace have make it almost impossible for they to leave iran they urgently need clear guidance they need a way to formally register their presence and they need consular support which they be struggle to access will the minister urgently meet i to ensure that my constituent get the assistance they need from the government to come home safely to eastbourne 
 i be of course very happy to meet the hon gentleman the whole house know that we have advise against all travel to iran for some time and we have be clear that our ability to provide consular assistance in iran be very limited for those reason particularly give the temporary withdrawal of our embassy we would encourage those in iran to be in touch with the foreign office and we will provide what advice and support we can 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of recognise the state of palestine 
 we be committed to recognise a palestinian state at a time that have the most impact and be most conducive to long term prospect for peace uk bilateral recognition be the single most important action we can take towards palestinian statehood which be why it be important to get the timing right so that it create genuine momentum and be not simply a symbolic gesture 
 what be happen in gaza be hard enough to watch but if we be to prevent the west bank from go the same way in a few year time we must act today do the minister agree that recognise the principle of a palestinian state without make any judgment for the moment on its border be the strong and most effective way to reaffirm the uk ’s long stand commitment to a state solution while there be still territory leave to form it with 
 the hon gentleman make important point about the situation in the west bank point that we have discuss in this chamber before we have condemn the violence and the expansion of illegal settlement in the west bank there be a range of issue on which we profoundly disagree with the israeli government in relation to their approach to the west bank and we will continue to raise those issue with force i refer he to my previous answer about recognition 
 can my hon friend update i on the conference that be due to be hold at the weekend but be postpone follow the bombing of iran by israel at which the potential for recognition be to be discuss 
 i think my hon friend refer to the state solution conference that be due to take place in new york last week it have be suspend for understandable reason give event in the region by its french and saudi co host we expect that it will be rearrange and i have be in conversation with my saudi colleague about when that might be 
 what recent progress he have make on secure the release of alaa   abd   el fattah 
 i be commit to secure alaa   abd   el fattah ’s release i be commit to this before come to power and i remain committed now the government be engage intensively on this case i raise alaa ’s imprisonment every time i be in contact with my egyptian counterpart and the prime minister have raise it in several conversation with president sisi 
 i think everybody in this chamber include the foreign secretary be desperately worried about the health of laila soueif who have feel that she have no choice but to be on hunger strike since her son alaa should have be release last september she be in and out of hospital desperately ill die in slow motion as her daughter say i welcome the work that the foreign secretary and the prime minister have do on this case and the commitment they have make as the foreign secretary know the egyptians have remain steadfast in their objection can he confirm that he be consider all option to secure alaa ’s release include change the foreign office travel advice for egypt to highlight the risk of arbitrary detention so that no other family be put through this kind of anguish 
 this case and laila ’s condition concern i greatly it have be a top priority every week that i have be in office at every single level prime minister foreign secretary minister national security adviser we be engage with the egyptians i believe that our strategy be work but clearly give laila ’s health we must see progress at pace with the egyptian government 
 i recall the right hon gentleman before he become foreign secretary ask the previous government what diplomatic price egypt have pay for the arbitrary detention of alaa before demand that serious diplomatic consequence should be put on egypt should it not release he alaa ’s mother be now day into a hunger strike and be critically ill so let i ask he this since he become foreign secretary what diplomatic price have egypt pay and what serious diplomatic consequence can he point to that egypt have be force to pay since july last year 
 i can reassure the hon gentleman that i remain in close touch with laila and the family and that this be a no priority for i and i expect to see alaa release i gently remind the hon gentleman that he have stand up time after time to raise his concern about gaza and he will understand that if he want the uk government to have an effect in gaza we must have relation with the egyptians 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of support pious projects paediatric hospital in gaza 
 we be clear that israel must immediately allow rapid and unhindered aid into gaza include desperately need medical supply the uk continue to support the delivery of medical assistance through trust partner include uk med which have complete over patient consultation in gaza since january we will continue to assess how we can well support those in need 
 the foreign secretary will understand my question because i write to he on   june   ask if he would meet dr mohammed mustafa who have assemble a child ’s hospital in prefabricated form in jordan and be ready to go into gaza it will be able to help the child in northern gaza who have no access to any medical facility at all at the moment this be desperately urgent will the minister meet dr mustafa to familiarise himself with the opportunity here of do something practical and good to help desperate child in northern gaza 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his continued engagement on these question we have discuss across the dispatch box many time the restriction on aid get into gaza include in relation to construction material i be very happy to take a further look at this specific proposal and see if there be anything that we can do 
 the al ahli hospital in gaza which be run by the anglican church in jerusalem have repeatedly be bomb early this month the hospital compound be hit kill people include a father escort his son to surgery the minister have speak much about the need for aid to get in but will he set out what concrete action he be go to take now say that israel must do something do not mean that it be go to act so what action he be go to take to ensure that the attack on hospital medic and patient end 
 i want nothing more than for the attack on hospital medical personnel and aid worker to end my hon friend be right that i have say many time from this dispatch box that i want that to be the case yet these strike have continue we continue to raise these issue with the israeli government we have take a series of action many of which we have discuss already over the course of this morning and we will continue to take action until thing change until thing change this government will not be satisfied 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 britain be at the heart of diplomatic effort to de escalate the situation in the middle east we be clear that iran must never have a nuclear weapon while at the uk eu g7 and nato summit and in my engagement from the high north to north africa the government have be deliver security and growth for the british people deepen britain ’s partnership and alliance and address the ongoing horrendous conflict in gaza and ukraine 
 i know that this house alongside my constituent across bexleyheath and crayford welcome the sanction take against israeli official early this month what discussion be the uk government hold with our international partner regard further action that could be take in relation to the incitement of violence against palestinian citizen

 i recognise the point that the hon gentleman have make but let i make this clear to he once a country have acquire the ability to enrich uranium to that scientific knowledge be there and do not go away ultimately this will require a diplomatic solution that be what president trump be push for and that be what the uk government want to see as well

 today the prime minister attend the opening day of the nato summit that summit be expect to agree to a new commitment to grow spending on national security to of gdp by to be make up by a project split of on core defence spending and on broad resilience and security spending this will mark a new resolve among nato member to make our country strong and as we have always do the united kingdom will play our part 
 nato ’s member country meet at a time when the security situation be more in flux than at any time in a generation a time when ukraine be in its year of resist russia ’s invasion a time when we in europe be be ask to do more to secure our own defence a time when security involve not just the traditional realm of air sea and land but technology cyber and the strength of our democratic society and as we have see in recent day a time of renew military action in the middle east with israel and the united states act to try to stop iran develop a nuclear bomb news of a ceasefire be welcome but as we have see even in recent hour the situation remain fragile and the focus must now be on a credible plan to stop iran develop nuclear weapon 
 it be to the great pride of my party that nato be found in the aftermath of the world war with the strong support of the post war labour government ernest bevin the foreign secretary at the time say that 
 we must face the fact as they be ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 today in this very different age we too must face the fact as they be 
 the generation that found nato see it as a powerful expression of collective security and solidarity alliance abroad match by capacity at home our national security strategy publish today and make for these very different time be inspire by those same value and aim every member of this house understand that the duty of any government be to keep the country safe that be and always will be our no priority and our national security strategy set out how we will do that 
 the world have change fundamentally and continue to change before our eye this be indeed an age of radical uncertainty and the challenge to leadership in time of such change be to understand to respond and to explain the british people understand this they recognise that we be live in a world that be more confrontational more turbulent and more unpredictable than most of we have experience in our lifetime 
 when the prime minister speak to the house in february he promise to produce a national security strategy that would match the scale of the task ahead the strategy we have publish today do that with a plan that be both clear eyed and hard edged about the challenge that we face it set out a long term vision for how we will do crucial thing we will protect security at home by defend our territory   control our border and make the uk a hard target for our enemy that be strong and more resilient to future threat 
 secondly we will promote strength abroad that mean bolster our collective security renew and refresh our key alliance and develop new partnership in strategic location across the world it also mean take a clear eyed view of how we engage with major power such as china in order to protect our national security and promote our economic interest and my right hon friend the foreign secretary will make a further statement on the china audit shortly 
 thirdly we will increase our sovereign and asymmetric capability by rebuild our defence industry train our people focus investment on our competitive strength and use our exceptional research and innovation base to build up advantage in new frontier technology 
 all this will make we a strong and more resilient country but deliver on each commitment will be possible only if all part of society be pull in the same direction our manufacturing science and technology industry have to be align with national security objective our industrial strategy publish yesterday will help play to the uk ’s strength and deepen our capability the investment we announce in the spending review also deepen our resilience and strength as a country with a health service strong enough to cope safe and secure energy supply modern housing and transport for our people all of which contribute to a strong united kingdom 
 that be why it be so important that all part of government and business big and small understand that cyber security be national security and that our core system and the revenue of business be be target by our adversary it be why we as legislator have to ensure that our own law from border to trade fit with national security this will take a whole system approach that reflect today ’s reality national security mean strong supply chain control on immigration tackle online harm energy security economic security and border security it transcend foreign and domestic policy and it all play a role in how we make britain a safe more secure and more sovereign nation 
 this document provide the blueprint of how this fit together the strategy bring together everything we be do across the full spectrum of national security the commitment to spend that of our domestic economic output on national security by meet our nato commitment once again the over £ we be invest in a new network of national biosecurity centre how we be step up in area such as cyber capability our anti corruption strategy to counter illicit finance the expansion of our legal and law enforcement toolkit the large sustained investment in our armed force since the cold war our plan for defence investment to unlock real benefit for work people how we will prioritise nato explicitly in our defence planning a vision for not only deepen our alliance with the united states and the european union but grow our relationship with other emerge nation the money we be invest in our brilliant research and development base over the come year such as the £ for the supercomputer at the university of edinburgh and   our ambition to gain a competitive advantage in cut edge technology and to embed national security in our artificial intelligence agenda 
 we do not underestimate the size of this task the world be a more dangerous place than at any time since the end of the cold war yet it be also a place where britain ’s value capability and alliance can make a positive difference since we come to power we have take step after step to prepare britain for what lie ahead record investment in defence back our ally and resist the false choice put before we that would only have weaken our country today ’s strategy represent an important contribution to all that work it recognise that our long term growth prosperity and living standard all depend on national security become a way of life for people and business in the uk this be a plan for how we protect the british people it be a plan for today ’s time but root in long hold value it be a plan to defend our national interest deepen our international alliance and increase our sovereign capability and i commend it to the house 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i be grateful to the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for advance sight of the statement and of the strategy 
 protect our country from internal and external threat to keep the british people and our interest safe be the no priority for any government as a former home secretary i have see at hand the incredible effort of our security and intelligence service to keep we safe so much of their work will never be disclose but i know that the whole house will join i in thank they for all they do alongside our police counter terrorism operation the armed force and all those who work so hard to keep britain safe 
 his majesty ’s opposition will always work constructively with the government in the national interest especially in the current global climate when threat be increasingly complex and multifaceted iran china russia north korea non state terrorist actor and transnational criminal all pose a significant threat to we all that be why we welcome action that build on the measure we put in place in government include our national security act which give we increase oversight of adversarial action and introduce the foreign influence registration scheme 
 the statement and the strategy refer to the pillar of security at home strength abroad and increase sovereign and asymmetric capability and i will take each in turn on security at home protect critical national infrastructure must be a key component of any national security strategy how will that work in practice what resource will be provide what further step be be take to protect people on british soil from transnational repression with china place bounty on the head of people in our own country and both the nss and the strategic defence review highlight the threat pose by china can the right hon gentleman confirm that china will be place on the enhance tier of firs will the government drop their support for the china super embassy spy hub 
 on project our strength abroad the right hon gentleman mention today ’s nato summit and the commitment to increase what he call national security spending to of gdp by with on core defence but he do not have a plan to get to let alone the it be all smoke and mirror so when will he deliver a plan to get to and why will he not heed our call to hit by the end of this parliament that would be a vital step stone on the way to the high defence spending he be seek will the government give clear information on exactly what spending will be include in the target be there any new money and do this for example include the cost of sizewell as we hear recently 
 as well as increase spending we need to develop a tough edge for a dangerous world give the security threat that we continue to face will labour ’s £ chagos surrender treaty be scrap it undermine our national security and contrary to the prime minister ’s claim our loss of sovereignty have be publicly back by representative of the regime in china russia and iran the cost also hoover up money that we could spend on much need defence capability at this incredibly dangerous time 
 on increase sovereign and asymmetric capability can the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster explain what support will be give to private enterprise and what investment will support effort in this area i also note that the word in the government ’s strategy do not quite align with their broad action for example the decision to allow the chinese firm mingyang to provide wind turbine for large wind farm project in the uk do he acknowledge the need to protect our energy infrastructure from such potential malign activity and if so what concrete step have be take to increase the very resilience of our own infrastructure 
 finally on the important role of the joint committee on the national security strategy and of parliamentary oversight we understand that the national security adviser jonathan powell have not be make available to the committee for question the government have claim that it would not be appropriate for he as a special adviser to answer question from the committee however in this case it be more than clear that mr powell ’s role as the national security adviser put he in a unique position a unique senior position and it appear that as the lead adviser for the government ’s national security strategy it be only right that the joint committee be able to put question to he give the important issue here and mr powell ’s senior role and central position will the government finally let he give evidence to the committee to allow it to undertake its important work 
 we will always work to support the defence and security of britain and engage constructively with minister and challenge they to do everything possible to keep we safe so i welcome the chance for these question to be answer today 
 let i express my gratitude to the shadow foreign secretary for her response the spirit in which she put her question and her welcome for at least broad part of the strategy we have publish today let i turn to the question she have ask and try to address they 
 on the resource to protect people we make our commitment to increase defence expenditure to of gdp unlike the conservative party we say exactly how we would pay for that even though it mean a very difficult choice on this side of the house on the firs scheme the right hon lady will be aware that iran and russia have be place on the enhance tier she ask about our approach to china this be a serious question and we must have a serious approach to it the conservative party during its time in government veer between the naivety of the so call golden era to in effect no engagement at all we believe that both be the wrong approach instead our approach will be mark by a desire to protect our national security and to promote our economic interest total disengagement be not a good option for the uk so we will be guide by both the foreign secretary as i say will make a full statement on china shortly 
 the right hon lady ask what might be include in the it will include such thing as cyber security border security and telecom infrastructure to those who ask what those thing have to do with defence let i be clear our opponent and our enemy know that they be part of national security and we should recognise that too 
 finally we have resist the opposition ’s plea for we to choose between our ally in resist that i believe we have a strategy that make our country strong and enhance britain ’s capability that be at the heart of the strategy we put today indeed we make a conscious choice to increase investment in the country ’s future capability at the spending review this will give we increase strength in the future the spending we have commit to be fund it be set out in the spending review and that be the approach we will take in the future too 
 i call the chairman of the joint committee on the national security strategy 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement i totally agree that defence and security have to begin at home in the home and in the workplace this be a very welcome comprehensive national security strategy give its wide range assessment of all the threat we face in defence security critical national infrastructure and so on an impressive number of workstream have feed into it aukus the sdr the resilience review and so on but there be no mention of the national security council can my right hon friend tell i what he be do to ensure that there be a coherence across the strategy that will herald a cultural change in how this country face security 
 i thank the chair of the joint committee for his question i should have say in response to the shadow foreign secretary that i hope to reach a resolution with the committee soon on the matter of appearance before it i be always happy to appear before the committee if invite the chairman of the joint committee be quite right to say to the house that publishing strategy be thing but there must be follow through the difference between this and some other document produce be that it be a whole system approach look at sovereign capability international   alliance and make our country a hard target for our enemy all of those must be bring together and follow through in a systematic way 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats welcome the publication of the government ’s national security strategy because we recognise that we be live in a world that be less stable and more insecure now than at any time since the end of the cold war putin ’s force continue to wage their war in ukraine the middle east be teeter on the precipice of a fully fledge regional war and the action of the united states under an unreliable president trump be put an enormous strain on the post war settlement from which we have benefit so much 
 the nature of the threat we face continue to evolve as have become immensely clear to million of people across the country with the recent cyber attack on marks and spencer and the co op and in other country we have see attempt by authoritarian state to meddle in free and fair election that be why we welcome so much of what be contain in the strategy it be also why the liberal democrats have welcome the government ’s decision to increase defence spending to of gdp although we have urge ministers to go far 
 give the new nato target of of gdp will the government now urgently convene cross party talk to establish a consensus on how to get there we need to show our adversary we be serious about that commitment the strategy also have a welcome focus on resilience something especially important give not just the scale of the threat we face but its varied nature will the minister look at step take by our ally such as estonia to inform their population about how to deal with those threat should they arise to reflect the threat pose to our democracy by hostile actor will he make protect our democracy a national security priority i also note the importance that the review place on sovereign independent capability be that an admission from the government that under president trump the united states be no long a reliable ally will the assessment be carry over into defence procurement where we look to maintain an inextricably close bond with the united states 
 i thank the hon lady for her comment let i try to go through some of the issue she raise she be absolutely right to draw attention to the importance of the recent cyber attack on marks and spencer the co op and the legal aid system they show what both state and non state actor can do and they show how important it be that we strengthen our cyber capability and our cyber defence as much as possible in term of be serious the action we have take so far since the election show that we be serious we have a plan in place to increase defence spending to of gdp this parliament it take a very difficult decision to do that but at the spending review we show exactly how that would be pay for on her reference to the united states it remain a strong reliable deep and important ally for the united kingdom the relationship between we help to protect the british people every day 
 in the absence of the publish china audit which we have all be look forward to so much the national security strategy have be go through with a fine toothed comb by many of we on china it state 
 instance of china ’s espionage interference in our democracy and the undermining of our economic security have increase in recent year 
 may we have some guidance on how we will address that because that be not entirely clear in particular what advice be be give to the nation and region when they be deal with our big trading partner with whom we need to promote but also protect ourselves 
 i thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee for her question if people look at page of the document they will see many reference to china and i refer to the statement that the foreign secretary be go to make on our advice to people as i say it be guide by the protection of our security interest and the promotion of our economic interest she refer specifically to the devolved government and the nation and region we do arrange a recent security briefing for the ministers at the time of the recent meeting of the council of the nations and regions because we agree it be important to bring they into our thinking and help they play their role in protect our national security interest too 
 the right hon gentleman ’s long experience will tell he that sometimes in government the grander the language the less significant the actual announcement but if on this occasion i be perfectly prepared to accept that this be so the government be make a serious effort to redraw the boundary of what be national security policy and what be not do he agree that we need match parliamentary scrutiny of that area of policy as he know the intelligence and security committee be the only committee with the necessary clearance to look at classified material do he think that this be a good moment to look again at the memorandum of understanding between the committee and the government about what the committee cover 
 the right hon and learn gentleman be right to say that the document be distinguish by a broad view of national security which be also reflect in the discussion at nato today where we be look beyond our core defence expenditure on our armed force to the other thing we have discuss that contribute to our national security i thank the intelligence and security committee for its work in all its iteration over the year i have a good dialogue with the committee i look forward to that continue and to the committee play its very important role 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s focus on build up our armed force in this more uncertain world but be it not also vital for our national security that we focus on prevent conflict bring side together to negotiate and mediate can stop conflict spill over and allow our armed force to focus on the serious threat he have identify in the national security strategy it be for that reason that former military chief head of the security service and select committee chairs last week write a letter to   the pm call for investment in peacebuilding and conflict prevention will the minister commit to use all the tool in our kitbag include peacebuilding and conflict prevention to keep our citizen safe 
 my hon friend be quite right to draw attention to the deep expertise that exist in the diplomatic service which advance our national interest in a whole range of way every day include in conflict resolution i pay tribute to the work of those in our diplomatic post and diplomatic service across the world 
 if you will allow i mr deputy speaker i will read a small quote from page 
 we will continue to abide by the important principle share by nato and its key partner that the security of the euro atlantic and indo pacific region be inextricably link 
 but that be not how the us view it the trump administration see they as quite separate and would prefer the united kingdom to focus its effort on the euro atlantic how do the right hon gentleman explain that discrepancy 
 they be inextricably link while the prime minister attend the nato summit today our carrier group be in the indo pacific region it be quite right that the strategy we have publish today draw attention to our responsibility our ambition and our determination to act in both arena 
 i welcome this national security strategy defence begin at home and my community play a role in the uk ’s security and resilience with the hq of standing joint command in aldershot we need to focus as much on national resilience as on conventional military threat so will my right hon friend share the work he have be do on the national resilience strategy how do it fit with the national security strategy that be in front of we today 
 my hon friend be right that resilience and target hardening must be part of our national security strategy resilience be about capability and investment we be determined to do both and will have more to say about resilience in the come week 
 before the most recent election the intelligence and security committee produce a very comprehensive report on china make it very clear that it consider china to be of our great threat i be therefore astonish that in the whole of today ’s strategy there be paragraph that deal with china and that it raise or issue and then proceed to take a different decision it talk about there be a problem with human right which be genocide and the cyber security attack on the uk as well as china ’s espionage interference in our democracy sanctioning of people like myself and undermine of our economic security and its be guilty of transnational repression china also ship arm to myanmar keep that brutal regime in charge at the same time as build the large navy to what degree do paragraph satisfy the idea that china should surely be in the list of threat 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question let i make it clear that any sanction on uk parliamentarian be wrong and there be no place for they the paragraph he refer to set out some of our position on china as i have say the foreign secretary will however make a broad statement on the china audit immediately after this statement i repeat again what i say in my opening remark our approach to china will be guide by protect our security interest which we will always do robustly but also by promote our economic interest we do have an economic relationship with the big economy in the world 
 i thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for his statement which be another firm example of this government ’s top priority of keep resident safe as the nature of warfare be change may i once again gently raise the importance of health security and lobby for harlow to be the new home of the uk health security agency 
 i believe my hon friend be due happy birthday wish so let i take that opportunity and thank he too for his tireless campaign for locate the laboratory in harlow the facility be an important capability for the united kingdom a decision have be await for some year i be not ready to announce it today but people will not have too long to wait before it be announce 
 the national security strategy document outline an expand meaning of national security to include area such as food security if food security be national security i certainly agree it be we need to increase domestic production instead of cut support for farmer and increase our reliance on import from the other side of the world will the chancellor outline how the national security strategy will be use to change policy at the department for environment food and rural affairs 
 the government agree that food security be important our farmer food producer and food retailer have be burden with far too many increase cost and delay in recent year but the recent sanitary and phytosanitary agreement we reach with the european union will lift that burden that will be good news for food producer in the uk who will be able to grow and sell their magnificent produce with much great ease than in recent year 
 it be vital that the uk have robust defence against biological incident accident and attack what step be the government take to invest in our biosecurity and how that will help to protect our country from the range of bio threat that we face 
 there be a £ investment in biosecurity my right hon friend the secretary of state for defra have be able to announce only today new investment in critical resource at weybridge as part of that 
 i welcome today ’s national security strategy which bear a remarkable resemblance to every single i have see over the past year there have be only very slight adjustment over that period i wonder whether there be any connection   between the author or whether it be just that the official have not change so the politic have not change however thing that really have change over that period be technology and the document i have see this morning have very little connection to the democratisation of technology that we have see in ukraine ’s warfare in russia or between israel and iran or indeed in warfare we might see wag against we by the switching off of electronic item include solar panel and car by the chinese state 
 i have great respect for the right hon gentleman and i thank he for his question he be absolutely right to draw attention to the importance of technology which i mention in my opening remark it be why we have put such stress on have an ai action plan to make this country as strong as possible in this field and why we have make the investment in the supercomputer at edinburgh and this time put the money behind it such technology be a critical part of our strength as a country and we have significant advantage and expertise in it aspect of the document be about ensure that where we have an advantage we invest in it and we make sure that it deepen our capability in those crucial way 
 i have dreghorn and redford barrack in my constituency so i can only welcome the big uplift in defence spending since the cold war however many people will be concern about the cost i wonder whether there be an opportunity here if our nato ally be increase spending along with we be there an opportunity for our defence sector to benefit from that generate job and help to grow our economy 
 my hon friend be right decision to increase defence expenditure be not just about direct spending on the armed force but about the supply chain industrial capability defence supplier and critically the skill to meet our defence need that be why the prime minister have refer to a defence dividend this be not just security policy it be industrial and skill policy too 
 cyber security be core and central to our security at home but a significant weakness be the security of the cabling in the north atlantic and along the west coast of ireland for too long the irish government have freeload and take for grant the united kingdom provide defence and security have the government approach the irish government to see whether they will pay or play their part 
 i recently have the privilege of visit the cyber centre at queen ’s university in belfast which be do fantastic research in this area the hon member be right to draw attention to the importance of subsea cable these carry critical datum between we and overseas country every day and it be certainly part of our strategy to do everything that we can to protect our subsea cable infrastructure 
 unlike   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat i welcome the focus on science and technology in the   national security strategy a new innovation quarter be be develop in talbot village and the local council aspire to be an ai growth zone so will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster tell i how this strategy will support growth and security in my constituency and across the south west of england 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the importance of technology i say in my opening remark that the investment that we make in the spending review which do not fall from the sky but come about because of choice make by the government contribute to the strength and resilience of the country that be why the strategy talk of pillar homeland security alliance abroad and deepen our sovereign capability and all be important 
 give the scale of foreign influence operation particularly those of china do the minister accept that britain ’s societal resilience remain far too limited without clear government message how can institution or the public properly play their role will the minister commit to expand the defend democracy taskforce to include public education support for free medium and curb people ’s liberation army link speaker at taxpayer fund event 
 i would say that my faith in british society be strong it be a strong society with deeply hold democratic value we never take that for grant but it have be endure and strong over the year the hon member be right to draw attention to the importance of defend our democracy we will always defend the right to have free election and of our elect representative to go about their business we will also do our good to promote free speech and debate in our democratic process
