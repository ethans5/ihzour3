on a point of order mr speaker 
 in the wee hour of   june i watch on as the most talented formidable and consequential politician of his generation a man who have represent the people of banff and buchan aberdeenshire east and gordon a man who have serve for term as the minister of scotland lose his parliamentary seat for the time in year it be a moment i will never forget not because of the nature of his defeat but for what happen next because within just a few moment alex salmond take to the podium and give a speech that despite all the despair that those of we in the snp feel in the room that night make we feel ft tall he give we back the hope that thing would get well and would get well quickly 
 rabbie burns once write 
 the heart ay ’s the part ay 
 that make we right or wrang 
 alex give all of we in the snp the belief that what we feel in our heart be worth fight for the belief that we could day become an independent nation alex salmond take we so very close to make that belief a reality 
 at this time of profound shock and sorrow i send my heartfelt personal condolence to alex ’s wife moira his wide family his friend and his legion of fan across the nationalist movement and within the alba party itself it be of great personal sorrow to i that alex salmond will not live to see scotland become an independent nation the challenge for all of we now in the nationalist movement be to make sure that we put good his legacy and deliver the future he so badly fight for throughout his distinguished parliamentary career 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i know that colleague from across the house will join i today in express our shock and sadness at the sudden passing of the right honourable alex salmond he be a member of this house for year and of the scottish parliament for year and he be of course minister of scotland for year his impact wherever he serve be profound 
 my thought and sympathy be and foremost with his family and friend and especially his wife moira who have already be mention member might not be aware that the scotland office bring moira and alex together they meet as colleague in that department before marry in my thought be also with those whose relationship with he have break down in recent year and those who be find this time difficult as they deal with a range of emotion 
 it be no secret that some of his happy period as a politician be spend in this place where he make alliance that may to some have seem surprising my thought today be particularly with   the right hon member for goole and pocklington sir david davis who i know have lose a close friend and with alex ’s snp colleague 
 in the short period during which our career in this place overlap i be always impressed with alex ’s formidable oratory and debate style no member from any part of this house be give an easy ride he sit on the bench where the leader of the snp   the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn   be today during the passage of the scotland act chuntering and banter in my ear every time i stand at the opposition dispatch box his love of lively discussion extend beyond this chamber and i be always keen to keep the topic on our share passion for heart of midlothian football club rather than constitutional matter 
 it be impossible to overstate the impact that alex have on scotland and our politic after half a century of involvement from student activist to minister whether you agree or disagree with his political objective there be no deny the rigour and commitment with which he pursue his goal that commitment see alex lead the scottish national party for a total of year take it from a small political movement to the party of government in scotland in do so he secure a referendum on scottish independence in an achievement that would surely have be scarcely believable for a student activist who join the snp in the early 1970 and perhaps even for the alex salmond who lead the party in the early 1990 
 as someone firmly on the opposite side of that debate i know that the result of the referendum be a source of huge disappointment to alex it be testament to his conviction in the cause that he continue to campaign for scottish independence with the same passion in parliament in the snp in the alba party and in community across scotland throughout the past decade he have leave an indelible mark on scottish politic and public life i know that many in the independence movement and beyond will miss he i once again send the deep sympathy on behalf of the uk government to all his family and friend at this difficult time 
 far to those point of order mr speaker on behalf of the opposition i would also like to pay my tribute to the right honourable alex salmond as other have say despite political difference we be all shock and sadden to hear the news on saturday of alex salmond ’s sudden passing he and i be both elect to the scottish parliament in and although we disagree on many of the big issue of the day not least the question of independence for scotland we all respect his dedication to public service as a member of the scottish parliament a member of parliament and as minister of scotland he be passionate formidable impressive and hugely charismatic alex salmond be undoubtedly a giant in scottish and united kingdom politic my sincere sympathy go to his wife moira and to his wide family in particular his sister gail who live in hawick in my constituency in the scottish borders my thought and prayer be with they all 
 far to those point of order mr speaker alex salmond be not just a parliamentary colleague of mine for a number of year when we live in aberdeenshire he be also my own member of parliament i confess that   i never actually vote for he but that do allow i to see and hear from all those who deal with he in the north east of scotland that he be genuinely a byword for energy and commitment in represent the interest of his banff and buchan constituent 
 it be not until i be elect here in that i get to know alex personally he and i both represent constituency heavily dependent on the fishing industry which be then face an existential crisis as cod stock in the north sea collapse at that time we all have to be expert in the spawn stock biomass of north sea cod and alex with his natural head for figure could sometimes leave everyone in the room breathless as he interrogate the so call expert about the statistical basis of what they be propose to do the survival of a scottish whitefish industry today be in no small part as a result of his effort then 
 it be also in that parliament that i meet and get to know alex ’s wife moira i do not think it be speak ill to say that alex could divide a room moira on the other hand be someone about whom i have never hear anyone say a bad word she have always be unfailingly warm and friendly her devotion to alex be total and obvious to i from the moment i meet she so it be to moira salmond today that my thought turn i can hardly imagine the sense of loss that she must be feel to moira and the rest of alex ’s family i send my condolence and those of my party as we mourn the passing of alex salmond a man whose like we may never see again 
 far to those point of order mr speaker the phrase end of an era be often bandy about but alex ’s parting really do feel like the end of an era 
 we be not friend we have a professional relationship i would say sometimes it be cordial sometimes it be less so because we disagree on some pretty fundamental issue i always respect alex as of the most formidable and indeed ruthless political operator of our generation i think he would welcome that epitaph alex ’s great political triumph be to be both establishment and anti establishment at the same time which be a pretty difficult trick to pull off while he be at moment minister of scotland he be also agitate to break up the united kingdom while at minute he be highly critical of the conservatives he be also rely on conservative msp in the scottish parliament to sustain his minority administration 
 of my job when i be elect in be to keep an eye on alex in the lobby because he have a habit of encourage chat with new conservative mp his line be that if scotland be independent that would be great for they because there would be a perpetual conservative government in england we have recently see that that argument be slightly flawed but i have to ensure that colleague be not tempt by it alex be skilled debater and that be very often demonstrate in this chamber despite his express wish to leave it he have an authenticity and a common touch that be so often absent from modern politic that be always very evident when see he with his constituent 
 i absolutely share the view of   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   on moira salmond in my dealing with she she be always a very charming and supportive spouse and my heart go out to she and to alex ’s friend and family at this very difficult time 
 far to those point of order mr speaker it may come as a surprise to member that i have a photograph of alex salmond in my back hall that be because a long time ago he   the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne   and i be all member of the students representative council of st andrews university it be a sleepy organisation in which we debate this and that then with a flash and a bang like mephistophele appear in doctor faustus he be there from nowhere a fully equip fully armed formidable young politician still in his late teen that come as a shock to we all 
 have debate with he in student debate i can tell the house that if he turn that laser eye on you and fire a verbal sally it go straight through you and then straight through the wall behind he be a superb debater i have never see his like what be fascinating about he be that he be a fully develop politician so early in life he know exactly what he be about and be determined to achieve his end 
 i be also briefly in the scottish parliament as   the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson   allude to in at a reception at the signet library in edinburgh he say jamie i want a word with you he corner i in of those half moon shape alcove and tell i very forcibly how support the snp government in would lead to a revival of the liberal party in the scottish parliament 
 mention have rightly be make of his widow moira whom i find to be a very nice person indeed she once stop i in the royal mile shortly after alex have become minister to say that she have get that dreadful upright piano out of the drawing room at bute house she just want i to know that my thought be not only with alex ’s family but with his circle of friend to whom he mean a very great deal our condolence should go to his family and to his friend as well 
 charles stewart parnell make his name in history and i believe that alex salmond will do so in exactly the same way for many year to come 
 i really regret this playground style characterisation of issue that be so fundamental particularly for those who live in gibraltar i mention the comment of the chief minister of the falklands and the right hon member have now force i to quote they give the nature of what he have just say the chief minister say some of these claim be 
 more about party politic blame gaming and tory party leadership issue than 
 they be actually about the sovereignty of people who live in the overseas territory he could not have be clear 
 i be very happy to meet the right hon gentleman to discuss any case on the conversation with the pakistani government the main concern in relation to the triples be about move they out of afghanistan and into pakistan in the place the agreement we have with the pakistani government mean that anyone who be be assess as part of the arap scheme will not be deport back to afghanistan which be really important but there be still a requirement to make sure that we can relocate eligible individual and their immediate family to the uk in an appropriate and reasonable way we be continue that work and we be continue the dialogue with the pakistani government in relation to this issue 
 thank you for call i to make my maiden speech madam deputy speaker before i do may i commend figen murray and her family and friend for the excellent    campaign they have continue completely selflessly i be sure it will save the life of hundred if not thousand of people they be a great example to we all

 before we come to oral question the house will wish to take a moment to remember our former colleague alex salmond who pass away at the weekend he serve the people of scotland for over year as a member of this house a member of the scottish parliament and for term minister of scotland he be a tireless campaigner for scottish independence secure the uk government ’s agreement to the referendum and play a lead role in the yes campaign his final departure from this house be in which mark the occasion in more than decade that he be not serve in an elect role either here or in holyrood he leave a deep and lasting legacy behind he his sudden death at the weekend come as a complete shock the thought of this whole house will be with his family and friend at this difficult time there will be a short time for tribute follow defence question 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what progress he have make on the strategic defence review 
 when he plan to announce the outcome of the strategic defence review 
 the prime minister commission the strategic defence review within week of take office it will ensure that the uk be secure at home and strong abroad both now and in year to come the review be the of its   kind in the uk and i be very grateful to lord robertson general sir richard barrons and fiona hill our external lead reviewer they will make their final report to the prime minister the chancellor and i in the half of i will report the scr to parliament 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that answer i be tell that all that branch of the armed force still have a long backlog of new recruit try to get through medical assessment what assurance can the secretary of state give we that the strategic defence review will take account of that 
 i have say that the strategic defence review will place people at its heart and we will place people at the heart of our defence plan the hon gentleman be absolutely right we follow year of the previous government ’s recruitment target for all force be miss every year we have a recruitment crisis and a retention crisis no plan for the future can deal with that without sort out recruitment 
 may i wholly concur with your tribute to the late alex salmond mr speaker 
 a critical element of the strategic defence review will be the defence of our overseas territory the foreign secretary tell the house last week that the deal with mauritius over the chagos island have be conclude to save we wait until next year will the defence secretary tell we today how much have we offer to pay mauritius over year for the privilege of our renting back a military facility that belong to we in the place crucially which department will pay that bill the ministry of defence or the foreign commonwealth and development office 
 the foreign secretary say in his statement that full detail will be properly set out when the treaty come before the house at that point the house can scrutinise the deal and approve it or not let i make it clear that we inherit a situation in which the long stand uk us military base be put at risk from problem to do with sovereignty and migration we have make a historic deal that secure the uk us base for the future which be why my counterpart the us defence secretary so strongly welcome it when we reach it 
 i call the new chair of the defence committee 
 thank you very much mr speaker i fully concur with your tribute to the late alex salmond 
 in these particularly volatile time i fully welcome the government ’s strategic defence review i for hope it will include serious analysis of the indo pacific region because many of we be very concerned about china ’s recent launch of military drill around taiwan will the secretary of state use this opportunity to condemn those highly aggressive and intimidatory manoeuvre what be the government do to work with international ally to de escalate tension 
 i will indeed my hon friend will know that our party go into the election commit to build on commitment the previous government   make on the indo pacific i want the strategic defence review to be not just the government ’s defence review but britain ’s defence review we be consult military veteran industry academic expert and all party in this house i trust that like i he will welcome that all party approach particularly as he now chair the select committee and will work with we 
 the sdr be welcome and need the previous conservative government leave our armed force personnel capability and funding deplete can the secretary of state—[interruption hang fire can the secretary of state assure i that the expert conduct our review will have an ongoing focus on our sovereign defence industrial base and ensure that region such as the north east be pivotal in that 
 they will indeed this be the way we can reinforce the uk ’s security and economy and yes we can build through the sdr on the work that   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge   do when he be minister for defence procurement like my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck i be really angry about the state of defence after the last government there be pound black hole in defence plan service morale be at record low and army number be set to fall below next year we will work night and day to make our force more fit to fight and to make britain more secure at home and strong abroad 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker i associate all of we in my party with your comment about the late alex salmond 
 the most important point about the sdr be that it must not be use as an excuse to delay increase the defence budget to of gdp in september in answer to write question the department say that it would set out a path to spend of gdp on defence as soon as possible but last week at the dispatch box in his middle east statement the prime minister say that the government would go to in due course we all know that there be a massive difference between the so which be it 
 the government be totally committed to spend on defence to meet the increase threat the country face the prime minister confirm that in his week in office when he and i be together at the nato summit in washington of course the last time this country spend on defence be in under labour and that level be not match in any of the year in which the hon gentleman ’s party be in power 
 that be a concern in just to remind the house the black hole in the defence budget be big than the defence budget and we be leave a note say that there be no money leave it be significant if the wording be no long as soon as possible and be now in due course it be in the national interest to go to because of the threat we face as a country if the secretary of state tell we now that he be fight   hard with the treasury to go to in the budget at the end of this month he would have our full support be that what he be do 
 year mr speaker yet the conservatives produce their unfunded plan for on defence only week before they call the election it be the hon gentleman ’s former boss the defence secretary ben wallace who tell the truth about their record in government when he say to the house 
 we have hollow out and underfunded”—[official report   january vol c. 
 our armed force since 
 what step he be take to increase military support to ukraine 
 what step he be take to increase military support to ukraine 
 this be day of russia ’s brutal illegal full scale invasion of ukraine on my day in this job i travel to odesa and meet president zelensky because ukraine be of my order priority just as it be for the government since then we have step up military aid speed up the delivery of battlefield supply and confirm that we will supply £ a year in military aid to ukraine this year next year and every year that it take for ukraine to prevail 
 medics4ukraine a uk base humanitarian organisation have deliver more than £ worth of medical aid and training to ukraine and its founder professor mark hannaford and lucia altatti be recently award medal for their contribution to that the government be commit to increase military aid do the secretary of state agree that medical support be a strategic component and will he meet the founder of medics4ukraine to discuss how the government can far support its lifesave work 
 i agree with my hon friend and i too pay tribute to the work of medics4ukraine the uk ’s defence medical services be also at the forefront of ukraine ’s effort to develop a modern military healthcare system we have provide training for battlefield surgical team we have supply medical equipment and as a world leader in military rehabilitation we be support the development of ukraine ’s rehabilitation hospital a member of our defence team will be delighted to meet my hon friend and medics4ukraine to take this matter far 
 it be hugely welcome to see the prime minister host president zelensky and welcome the new nato secretary general to london last week what step be my right hon friend take not only to ensure that uk meet our nato obligation but to fundamentally strengthen uk leadership in nato 
 my hon friend be right that be the priority it will be the centrepiece of the government ’s defence plan and it be at the heart of the strategic defence    review when president zelensky be in london last week he make it clear that for ukraine this be a critical period in the war the ukrainians be fight with huge courage but the russians be put great pressure on their frontline putin show contempt for the life of his own soldier the average russian loss in september be per day a record high and and a half time the level this time last year as zelensky promote his victory plan we in the uk and our ally must   do all that we can to strengthen ukraine during the come week 
 do the secretary of state agree that the democratic world can not afford to lose this war and do he recall that it be often say that the total defence expenditure of all ukraine ’s democratic ally far exceed anything that russia could possibly deploy so russia will inevitably lose when will we deploy this might to gain a decisive victory for ukraine and secure the international global order 
 the hon gentleman be right on both count the defence of the uk and the rest of europe start in ukraine and it be essential that we stand with ukraine and support it for as long as it take secondly as he say this be a matter that the prime minister and i discuss with the new secretary general of nato mark rutte last week when he be in london the ally together must do more to support ukraine now and to produce what it need in the future the new secretary general will make that of his priority 
 thank you for your kind comment about our late right hon friend alex salmond mr speaker 
 i thank the secretary of state for his contribution he will be aware of the failure of analysis at the start of the full scale invasion will he consider the report by phillips o’brien and eliot cohen of the centre for strategic and international studies that look at some of those failure so that he be inform for the next process in term of support for ukraine and building support internationally 
 i will indeed if the hon gentleman could be so kind as to send i the executive summary rather than the full report i will certainly take a look   at it 
 what recent estimate his department have make of the percentage of russia ’s gross domestic product spend on its armed force in each year since the invasion of ukraine 
 russia ’s declare total military expenditure be around of gdp in in it be of gdp and the forecast spending this year be up to around of gdp as the right hon gentleman know very well the public figure almost certainly do not tell the full story about russian expenditure 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for put that on the record do that frightening set of figure not show the scale of the problem and the weight of attack that russia can bring to bear against ukraine how be we do with the double demand on our resource the need to both supply ukraine with hardware and ammunition and replenish our stock of hardware and ammunition in order to fulfil our nato security requirement 
 the right hon gentleman describe the double challenge of continue to support ukraine and replenish our stockpile particularly of the weapon ammunition and system that we have gift to ukraine the government already have £ worth of contract for replenish uk stockpile across a range of system and i can tell he that around of the contract production will be in the uk that be the way we strengthen britain ’s security for the future but also strengthen britain ’s economic growth and prosperity 
 i thank the secretary of state for the work he be do to support ukraine it be very important that we have a united front and that we be there for the long term to support ukraine as we have already hear this morning what be his view about the determination of our ally to see this conflict through right to the end 
 i feel more confident in this job than i do when i be in my previous job i recently attend the us lead gathering of almost country in ramstein where they make a long term commitment to support ukraine now and into the future that give i confidence that with work we can play a lead role in help that coalition to hold together and in get nato   to do more to co ordinate action and ensure that we   get support behind ukraine so that it prevail and putin lose 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of progress on the aukus strategic partnership 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of progress on the aukus strategic partnership 
 the uk be fully commit to the aukus partnership on   september the secretary of state host the aukus defence ministers meeting outside the us during that discussion he provide direction and guidance to accelerate our taking advantage of the opportunity that this landmark partnership present to we i refer member to the defence ministers meet joint communication for more detail on progress 
 the secretary of state already know how proud we be in barrow and furness to be build our astute and dreadnought submarine and to be part of the aukus programme i know from our discussion that this government understand that we need a cross departmental approach to support the delivery of the aukus deal in barrow and furness   will he comment on the importance of that broad approach which aim to make barrow an even well place in which to live work and raise a family and will he meet i to discuss that far 
 i thank my hon friend for her question both the secretary of state and i have visit barrow to see not only the incredible innovation in the shipyard there but the amazing workforce who be put together the nuclear submarine as my hon friend know the government be indeed work across departments and with the local council and bae systems to invest heavily not only in the development of the shipyard and the submarine facility but in the community that they need i would be very happy to meet she and colleague to discuss this issue far 
 the most recent aukus defence ministers communiqué outline an investment in industrial capacity include £ from this government and the royal united services institute have say that the winner in any prolonged war will be the country with the most secure industrial base will the minister expand on his answer to   the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis   and describe how this investment in our defence capability will strengthen supply chain in place such as billingham in my constituency 
 it be certainly true that army march on their stomach and in the event of a large conflict it will be the strength of our industrial base that determine the victor that be why we be work together with industry to deliver a new defence industrial strategy in particular to strengthen our resilience and innovation and to harness expertise include in my hon friend ’s constituency i would be happy to meet he to discuss how we can make the most of those opportunity 
 the minister will know that our aukus partner the united states and australia have recently hold bilateral discussion with south korea japan new zealand and canada about become part of the so call pillar of aukus and i wonder what bilateral discussion the uk have have on this 
 there be an opportunity to work   with many of our partner internationally on pillar opportunity those conversation have be take place at official level within the ministry of defence and at political level and we be continue to work to bring those forward because if we want to buy the high end war win kit that we need the good way of do that be to work with our partner to ensure not only that we have it but that our ally be able to make the most of it as well 
 in the light of the increase geopolitical threat that we face can the minister give an update on the adequacy and resilience of the computer chip supply chain that back up the uk military 
 the hon member be right to highlight the fragility of the international supply chain in that area it be very important that government in the west and in the nato alliance in particular be able to   onshore production and to friendly shore production no matter how awkward that term be to ensure that we be less exposed to threat colleague in the department for business and trade as well as mod colleague be look into that more work be need in this area but we be act on it 
 what progress he have make on implement the recommendation of the lgbt veteran independent review 
 if you will allow i to say so mr speaker it be with great pride that i stand behind this dispatch box for the time after year of service to represent veteran serve personnel and their family and dependant be under no illusion it be now my duty to serve they here in government and to fight for the deal that they deserve 
 i be serve when the ban be lift in by a labour government the treatment of lgbt veteran be completely and utterly unacceptable the treatment of lgbt veteran have be deal with by the etherton review which we will see out at the end of the year we have meet of the recommendation and we will meet those on the financial redress scheme by the end of this year with a launch in january next year 
 lgbt veteran have suffer appal injustice and ingratitude include many in my brighton kemptown and peacehaven constituency i welcome the update from the minister but he will know that it be recommendation on financial redress and compensation that be cause concern among veteran because the report cap compensation at £ the average payment per veteran might be as low as £ the then prime minister now the leader of the opposition rightly tell the house that the ban be 
 an appalling failure of the british state”.—[official report   july vol c. 
 will the minister meet i and fight with pride to discuss how we can take this forward to get fair and swift compensation

 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question and for champion the country ’s tech sector she be absolutely right that the experience we be see in ukraine mean that we need to innovate fast have more spiral development and bring more talent into these sector we have a good record of do so not just on drone but on ai and direct energy system where we have our own capability we be now work with nato eyes and aukus partner to ensure that we learn from that and to make sure that it be not just our big defence prime but the entire supply chain include small business and start up that benefit

 as the minister will know the royal fleet auxiliary industrial dispute be put our national security at risk do he think it be a betrayal of our defence that labour put generous settlement for their rail paymaster over the small number of seafarer who keep we safe 
 i think the hon gentleman can do well than that to be honest it be important that we support not only those who serve in all our force but those in the royal fleet auxiliary discussion be ongoing to try to resolve the industrial action that start under   the last government and i want to thank all those who serve in the royal navy in the royal fleet auxiliary and in civilian role it be the whole team that matter and they all matter to this government

 i be grateful for the contribution of south west defence company to our national defence as a south west mp i know it be important 
 if we be to have sustainable defence we need not only our armed force but our supply chain to invest in skill on a sustainable long term basis short term contract do not contribute to that which be of the reason why as part of our defence industrial strategy and the strategic defence review we be look long term at how to make sure we have the skill we need for both those who serve and those who support those who serve there be a lot of work to do in this area 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as a rifleman i know the importance of training for military operation it ensure readiness lethality and survivability in addition to the recent announcement that there be no firm timeline for spend of gdp possible cut to the training budget have be mention will the minister confirm that there will be no cut to the training budget in either this financial year or the next 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place it be a great job be shadow minister for the armed forces as i know if i may say so politely the reason there be severe financial pressure on we be that this government be leave with a £ financial black hole by his party let i be clear support our armed force to train to be the good to deter aggression and to defeat it if necessary be a priority for this government despite the economic circumstance his party pass on to mine we be take step to ensure that our armed force have what they need 
 what step he be take to support veteran 
 this be a government of service that will always stand up for those who serve our country that be why the prime minister focus on the debt we owe our veteran in his conference speech as prime minister as a veteran myself i stand steadfast in my commitment to deliver improved service for veteran work closely across government and with the devolved government 
 the lord kitchener memorial holiday centre be an extraordinary charity in my constituency set up more than year ago after the great war to provide convalescence for return soldier today it provide much need short stay for veteran and their family across the country as well as a drop in and information centre for veteran locally but sadly its funding situation be precarious do the minister agree that invest in our locally value veteran charity be essential if we be to provide the good support for our brave service personnel 
 i thank my hon friend for an important statement and question and i thank the lord kitchener memorial holiday centre for all the work it have do in support veteran for over a century now it be truly deserving of applause i would be happy to visit the centre with she to see the brilliant work that it do the government be look at the good way to deliver collaboratively across the charitable sector which include more than charity to deliver the good support for veteran and deliver the deal they deserve 
 during his labour conference speech the prime minister make of his key announcement 
 we will repay those who serve we and house all veteran in housing need home will be there for hero 
 hear hear 
 wait for it last week the government confirm that that would actually be do by exempt veteran from local connection and residency test rather than by make dedicated housing available give that it be a key conference pledge what guarantee be the government able to offer veteran that home really will be there for they 
 as the hon gentleman will know op fortitude be run and we have have more than referral so far with veteran put into housing we will continue to extend the programme to ensure that every veteran have a home in due course 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this weekend mark year since of the most appalling and audacious terrorist attack on british soil the attack on the conservative party conference in brighton in people die in the bombing if you will forgive i mr speaker they be the member of parliament for enfield southgate anthony berry lady jeanne shattock muriel maclean of the scottish conservatives eric taylor and roberta wakeham all be remember people be also injure and some never recover 
 the peace that we enjoy today in northern ireland and across these island be hard won over many decade but hard won also be the protection afford to our veteran who serve our country through the trouble and have since be plague by ambulance chase lawyer with vexatious claim that protection be achieve through the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act but there be concern within the veteran community that the new government ’s propose   repealing and replacement of that act will put those man and woman many of whom be now well into retirement at risk can the hon and gallant gentleman assure i and they that they will be protect and that those who serve our country with distinction and valour over so many year will never be at the mercy of those seek to distort their service or to damage their life and reputation 
 i thank the hon and gallant gentleman for his comment our government recognise the important service of veteran and serve personnel and the sacrifice they make to keep we all safe in northern ireland during the trouble i do not serve during the trouble but i do serve in northern ireland and i understand they he have my absolute commitment that any individual who need to go through legal proceeding will get the correct welfare and legal support 
 what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on support for ukraine 
 what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on support for ukraine 
 what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on support for ukraine 
 i regularly discuss how good to support ukraine with international partner last week i meet my ukrainian counterpart and the new secretary general of nato in london last month at the ukraine defence contact group in ramstein i meet nearly other defence ministers who come together to commit to continued support of ukraine both in the immediate fight and for the long term 
 i thank my right hon friend for his response our military support need to be part of wide diplomatic and economic support there be grow concern about loophole that allow russian oil export to a party country to be develop into other petroleum product and then to be import into the uk and other country that have impose sanction on russia can the secretary of state tell i what work he and his counterpart be do to crack down on that loophole and to stop inadvertently fund the russian war effort 
 my hon friend be right alongside military aid economic support and diplomatic help be require to support ukraine and put pressure on russia the uk have ban the import of russian oil and oil product in line with the step take by the us and the european union importer must now include proof of origin and country of last dispatch as a way of tighten up on the loophole and we will not hesitate to take further action if russian revenue which fuel the war machine be not close off by the sanction 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer on a recent visit to ukraine i visit the chernihiv oblast which be a former russian red line there we see a large military effort by community and local government give that large segment of the military in ukraine be make up differently from our own ministry of defence what discussion be the secretary of state have to ensure fund be go into community and local government effort 
 like my hon friend i have be privileged to see some of those community effort and local mayor- lead initiative when i have visit ukraine part of the work that the government have put in place since i be proud of the uk ’s leadership on ukraine over that period have be to commit £ to the ukraine good governance fund that have allow community to draw down some of that funding and the ukrainian government to take step to deal with some of the corruption that have be endemic since the soviet period that be an extraordinary feat give that they be fight a war and deal with corruption in their system at the same time 
 with winter loom defend the home front in ukraine be paramount however russia have intensify its attack on energy infrastructure in ukraine include substation where it have deploy cluster munition that be particularly alarming give those development what additional support can the uk give through de mining equipment to get rid of those munition from the ground 
 my hon friend make an important point it be vital to remember that these be not military target they be civilian target these be russian action that breach international humanitarian law and we must never lose sight of the moral outrage about what the russians be do clearly with the onset of winter there be a vital imperative for britain and other country to step up support as we can since the election we have be offer specialist advice on how to protect energy generation and transmission site   and the foreign secretary when he be in ukraine   last month commit another £ to support emergency energy need 
 in the shell crisis of the government of the day and industry come together to support our troop on the western front we be hear much about new contract be place for thing such as ordnance which be critical to the defence of ukraine and to replenish our own stock do the secretary of state share my concern that senior figure in the scottish government seem reluctant to put money into those defence company except for civilian use can he explain how scotland can play its full part since it provide so much of the ordnance with everything from storm shadow to type destroyer build in scotland 
 the hon member and i share common cause in recognise the role that scottish worker and scottish industry play not just in the security of our own united kingdom but through the contribution we make to support ukraine in its fight i have be proud to visit worker in some of the scottish site our   defence industrial strategy as we develop it in the month ahead will reinforce the essential role that scotland play in our security and in the uk economy 
 last week president zelensky of ukraine meet with german chancellor scholz zelensky say 
 for we it be very important that aid do not decrease next year 
 it be welcome that the foreign secretary will meet with eu27 ministers later to discuss the war in ukraine but will the eu27 plus the uk be in a position to assure zelensky that military aid to ukraine will not decrease next year regardless of what happen in the presidential election next month 
 yes they will 
 i thank the defence secretary for that response when i look at israel ’s capacity to defend its citizen and its property with its dome system it be clear to i that ukraine need something similar have he have an opportunity to talk to his nato compatriot and with the usa in particular to see whether it be possible to offer ukraine some of the protection that israel have 
 the hon gentleman be right that of the priority that the ukrainian president and defence minister have constantly stress to we and other ally be the need for strong air defence it be of the reason we have now let a contract for short range air defence missile the lightweight multirole missile we will produce of those some of they deliver into ukraine before the end of the year and we look to go far in 
 what progress he have make on deliver the global combat air programme 
 i think you be mean to stand up when you ask a question formally 
 he ’ new 
 he ’ far too grand for it 
 let i be absolutely clear that gcap be an important programme as the prime minister have state that be why the defence secretary host his japanese and italian counterpart within week of take office progress continue alongside the strategic defence review with more than people employ on future combat air 
 i apologise if i be hypnotise by your gaze mr speaker 
 i worry about the government ’s grip on strategy all together they have give away the chagos island before the strategic defence review now they be put at risk the global combat air programme by include it within the sdr be the minister aware of the extreme effort that our partner in italy and japan visit by   the defence committee in the last parliament have make to discharge their side of the bargain in japan ’s case for the time since the world war in international procurement outside the usa what measure be he take to reassure they about the centrality and importance of the programme 
 the defence secretary have clear instruction from the manifesto that britain be to be well defend with a labour government that be why within week of take office the prime minister have commission lord robertson to conduct the strategic defence review the prime minister the defence secretary and i have all make it clear that gcap be an important programme not only do we have an amazing workforce work on it but i be pleased to tell the house that last month the uk ratify the gcap convention the international treaty that set up the gcap international government organisation we will continue to make progress 
 gcap will contribute £ to the economy but the minister will know that the sdr be under review have lead to a number of story appear in the press that the programme be about to cancel as someone who once represent general dynamics which build ajax i know that a belief that something will not happen tend to cause problem within the local and national economy as the sdr go ahead will the minister ensure that this house and the press will be keep up to date on how gcap be develop 
 gcap be an important programme and there will be far update in relation to it as the sdr report in the half of next year in the meantime we continue to progress the project indeed work be continue across a range of necessary and important defence project because we do not want the sdr to be an excuse to slow down progress at a time when our troop and ally be operate in difficult and contested environment we need to ensure that we invest in the kit that we need that be what the sdr will set out the future shape of the uk armed force 
 what plan he have for future level of spending on defence research and development 
 defence r&d be critical to maximise the operational advantage of our armed force in an increasingly volatile and technology drive world the department remain committed to invest in cutting edge science technology and innovation just after my appointment to the department i be delighted to visit the commando training centre in the hon member ’s constituency to see the innovative training and capability of the future commando force 
 frontier technology such as artificial intelligence be already shape every domain across the modern battlefield to stay ahead of our adversary and keep our service personnel and ally safe it be imperative that we have the domestic ability to develop   these technology as supercompute be essential   for the development of advanced ai system it be disappointing to see the labour government pull the plug on the university of edinburgh ’s £ exascale supercomputing project from listen to the secretary of state and his team i know that they understand the need to invest in ai for defence so will the minister please inform the house how the department intend to create these technology when his party ’s demand signal to academia and industry appear to be waver 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to the house as a fellow devon mp i believe it be important that we have a strong voice on defence so i be grateful for his question the new government have be very clear that we see ai play a really important role not just in defence but across a whole range of technology my right hon friend the secretary of state for science innovation and technology be lead on much of that work in his department ai and relate technology be be look at in relation to the strategic defence review where we need not only to upscale the innovative work that be already be do by uk technology but to provide the skill and the supply chain to ensure that we can continue to deliver learn the lesson from what we be see in ukraine in particular 
 minister repeatedly state their commitment to reach a spending level of of gdp on defence but they simply will not tell the house when they will do so it be no surprise that we be already hear report of potential cut to programme in defence r&d. will the minister simply rule out cut to defence r&d and science spending in this financial year and the next 
 as a government we be committed to spend of gdp on defence we have set out clearly that that will be announce at a future fiscal event i must say that i be a wee bit disappointed because i would have expect the opposition front benchers to stand up and apologise for the mess that they have leave not just the armed force but the wide economy the government be commit to spend of gdp on defence we be commit to invest in our armed force and we will continue to do so 
 may i concur with your comment about the late alex salmond mr speaker 
 the exchange of research and development between ukraine and the uk be vital to improve the security of both country what step be the department take to learn from the innovative technology from the battlefield to develop share collaborative capability 
 i congratulate the hon lady on her appointment as a shadow spokesperson i be in ukraine a few week ago lead a trade delegation of british company look at precisely the issue of how we can learn from the battlefield experience of ukraine make sure that for the new technology need there we   can invest in the supply chain not only in the uk but in ukraine to make it more resilient a lot of work be    ongoing in this area but we will need to do more if we be to defeat putin ’s illegal invasion we will need not only to restock our own supply chain but to accelerate the provision of innovative tech to ukraine that be what this government be commit to do 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the middle east continue to be a major focus for the government last week we pass year since the horrify hamas terror attack on israel we mark the memory of those who be murder we grieve with the family of the hostage who be still hold and we share the agony of so many palestinians over the civilian who have be kill since 
 we be work on an immediate ceasefire in gaza in lebanon we be work to reduce the risk of further escalation and a ceasefire and the un plan for a buffer zone be vital to that in addition last week i visit british troop in cyprus where contingency plan be in place to deal with further development on behalf of the house i thank they for their professionalism and their dedication

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thousand of child of armed force personnel face unaffordable increase to their school fee because of this government ’s ideological decision to charge vat on education that could have the perverse effect of force experienced personnel to quit the service of their country just when we should be seek to maximise retention will the minister therefore confirm that child of armed force family will be exempt from the new vat rise and furthermore that that exemption will apply from january when the new tax kick in 
 we recognise the extraordinary strain that be sometimes place on the family of armed force personnel include their child that be why the continuity of education allowance an important part of the package that reflect and respect the service be in place and it be why we be look very closely at option to ensure we continue with that 
 early this month a royal navy investigation find intolerable misogyny in the submarine service   follow complaint of bullying and sexual harassment forward assist a charity base in my constituency that support survivor have do research and a number of report into the prevalence and impact of military sexual trauma will the secretary of state meet i and that charity to discuss its finding and how we can support serve personnel and veteran 
 i would love to visit that charity with my hon friend in due course any report of misogyny or wrongdoing in any way be utterly unacceptable that be why since enter government we have start a programme of raise our standard with a plan to enact cultural change across defence with the aim of make defence the good place to work across government 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 this year british military jet have be involve in several operation in the middle east without consult parliament allow the commons to debate military action wherever feasible be essential to ensure public accountability will the secretary of state set out the government ’s stance on the use of a parliamentary vote to approve military action 
 it be a convention that if military action be authorise by the prime minister that be report as soon as possible to this house it be important to any prime minister and any government that if they commit uk force to military action they will want the support of all side of this house 
 under an agreement inherit from the last government a system remain in place allow for the licensing of trail hunting on land own by the defence infrastructure organisation it be welcome news that that licence issue have be pause while the agreement be under ministerial review but in the light of the widespread recognition that trail hunting be often a smokescreen for illegal hunting will the minister meet i and other concerned mp to discuss the permanent revocation of that agreement in line with the government ’s manifesto ban on trail hunting 
 i be grateful to my hon friend she and i have campaign on many similar issue for quite some time i would like to make it clear that no licence to trail hunt on ministry of defence land have be grant for the hunting season the department be consider its position alongside other government departments and we hope to have an update soon but i be very happy to meet my hon friend in the meantime

 i have be utterly shock by the state   of part of the housing estate that we have inherit over the last year the government of the time fail to decisively close with this issue instead kick   the can down the road or continually top up the leak bucket we have example of family live in accommodation with no run water with mould and with p infestation there be complaint between and have live in some of that accommodation i can tell the house that it be unacceptable our armed force protect the freedom we enjoy   and this government will take action include a medium to long term review to get after the housing and create a new armed force commissioner to improve service life 
 i be immensely proud of the armed force both those serve and veteran who live in my constituency but i do worry for the future give the recruitment crisis that we inherit from the previous government what step be this government take to tackle the recruitment crisis in particular to attract diverse skill such as in cyber 
 i be grateful for the question because we know that there be a recruitment and retention crisis in the uk armed force it be precisely for that reason that the defence secretary set out at the labour party conference a series of change include scrap outdated recruitment policy and create a new direct entry route for cyber there be a lot more work to be do in this area and the department will be make further announcement in due course 
 the lb bomb drop on innocent civilian in gaza and lebanon lead to the heinous and unimaginable scene we see over the weekend of newborn baby be kill and young child be burn alive these bomb be be drop by f-35 fighter jet and we supply part for f-35 fighter jet when will we stop do that and adhere to international convention 
 we have make decision on the suspension of arm sale to israel and we have set out the detail of those to the house we be work as well as call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza so that all hostage can get out all the aid need by the palestinians can be flood in and the step can be take towards the political solution that be ultimately the good guarantor of state and a permanent peace in the area 
 our duty as a government be to keep the nation safe and to protect our citizen particularly when we be go through a period of global strife and instability with war in europe and conflict in the middle east although i be aware of our unshakeable commitment to nato will my right hon friend please reassure the house that when it come to defence our relationship with our european ally have not be adversely affect by brexit

 in light of the late hezbollah attack on israel will the secretary of state assure the house that we will continue to supply defensive equipment to israel to help it defend itself against iranian proxy 
 we have an unshakeable commitment to the right of israel to defend itself and we have demonstrate in the past a willingness to stand with israel particularly when it have be under direct under attack from iran 
 we now come to point of order before the urgent question i will deal with they in a slightly different way from normal i call the leader of the scottish national party 
 pm 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 in the wee hour of   june i watch on as the most talented formidable and consequential politician of his generation a man who have represent the people of banff and buchan aberdeenshire east and gordon a man who have serve for term as the minister of scotland lose his parliamentary seat for the time in year it be a moment i will never forget not because of the nature of his defeat but for what happen next because within just a few moment alex salmond take to the podium and give a speech that despite all the despair that those of we in the snp feel in the room that night make we feel foot tall he give we back the hope that thing would get well and would get well quickly 
 rabbie burns once write 
 the heart ay ’s the part ay 
 that make we right or wrang 
 alex give all of we in the snp the belief that what we feel in our heart be worth fight for the belief that we could day become an independent nation alex salmond take we so very close to make that belief a reality 
 at this time of profound shock and sorrow i send my heartfelt personal condolence to alex ’s wife moira his wide family his friend and his legion of fan across the nationalist movement and within the alba party itself it be of great personal sorrow to i that alex salmond will not live to see scotland become an independent nation the challenge for all of we now in the nationalist movement be to make sure that we put good his legacy and deliver the future he so badly fight for throughout his distinguished parliamentary career 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i know that colleague from across the house will join i today in express our shock and sadness at the sudden passing of the right honourable alex salmond he be a member of this house for year and of the scottish parliament for year and he be of course minister of scotland for year his impact wherever he serve be profound 
 my thought and sympathy be and foremost with his family and friend and especially his wife moira who have already be mention member might not be aware that the scotland office bring moira and alex together they meet as colleague in that department before marry in my thought be also with those whose relationship with he have break down in recent year and those who be find this time difficult as they deal with a range of emotion 
 it be no secret that some of his happy period as a politician be spend in this place where he make alliance that may to some have seem surprising my thought today be particularly with   the right hon member for goole and pocklington sir david davis who i know have lose a close friend and with alex ’s snp colleague 
 in the short period during which our career in this place overlap i be always impressed with alex ’s formidable oratory and debate style no member from any part of this house be give an easy ride he sit on the bench where the leader of the snp   the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn be today during the passage of the scotland act chuntering and banter in my ear every time i stand at the opposition dispatch box his love of lively discussion extend beyond this chamber and i be always keen to keep the topic on our share passion for heart of midlothian football club rather than constitutional matter 
 it be impossible to overstate the impact that alex have on scotland and our politic after half a century of involvement from student activist to minister whether you agree or disagree with his political objective there be no deny the rigour and commitment with which he pursue his goal that commitment see alex lead the scottish national party for a total of year take it from a small political movement to the party of government in scotland in do so he secure a referendum on scottish independence in an achievement that would surely have be scarcely believable for a student activist who join the snp in the early 1970s and perhaps even for the alex salmond who lead the party in the early 1990 
 as someone firmly on the opposite side of that debate i know that the result of the referendum be a source of huge disappointment to alex it be testament to his conviction in the cause that he continue to campaign for scottish independence with the same passion in parliament in the snp in the alba party and in community across scotland throughout the past decade he have leave an indelible mark on scottish politic and public life i know that many in the independence movement and beyond will miss he i once again send the deep sympathy on behalf of the uk government to all his family and friend at this difficult time 
 far to those point of order mr speaker on behalf of the opposition i would also like to pay my tribute to the right honourable alex salmond as other have say despite political difference we be all shock and sadden to hear the news on saturday of alex salmond ’s sudden passing he and i be both elect to the scottish parliament in and although we disagree on many of the big issue of the day not least the question of independence for scotland we all respect his dedication to public service as a member of the scottish parliament as a member of parliament and as minister of scotland he be passionate formidable impressive and hugely charismatic alex salmond be undoubtedly a giant in scottish and united kingdom politic my sincere sympathy go to his wife moira and to his wide family in particular his sister gail who live in hawick in my constituency in the scottish borders my thought and prayer be with they all 
 far to those point of order mr speaker alex salmond be not just a parliamentary colleague of mine for a number of year when we live in aberdeenshire he be also my own member of parliament i confess that   i never actually vote for he but that do allow i to see and hear from all those who deal with he in the north east of scotland that he be genuinely a byword for energy and commitment in represent the interest of his banff and buchan constituent 
 it be not until i be elect here in that i get to know alex personally he and i both represent constituency heavily dependent on the fishing industry which be then face an existential crisis as cod stock in the north sea collapse at that time we all have to be expert in the spawn stock biomass of north sea cod and alex with his natural head for figure could sometimes leave everyone in the room breathless as he interrogate the so call expert about the statistical basis of what they be propose to do the survival of a scottish whitefish industry today be in no small part a result of his effort then 
 it be also in that parliament that i meet and get to know alex ’s wife moira i do not think it be speak ill to say that alex could divide a room moira on the other hand be someone about whom i have never hear anyone say a bad word she have always be unfailingly warm and friendly her devotion to alex be total and obvious to i from the moment i meet she so it be to moira salmond today that my thought turn i can hardly imagine the sense of loss that she must be feel to moira and the rest of alex ’s family i send my condolence and those of my party as we mourn the passing of alex salmond a man whose like we may never see again 
 far to those point of order mr speaker very very few people in this house change history most of we be move by it rather than move it ourselves alex salmond be an exception to that as we have hear from all the people mostly his opponent who have speak well of he today he be a brilliant speaker passionate about social justice and particularly passionate about his own country and his wish for independence and the scottish nationalist agenda he be fiercely brave something that we often miss in this place he be willing to challenge every establish power structure he be incredibly energetic erudite intelligent and a brilliant leader as a result he achieve the thing we have hear about the scottish nationalist cause go from what be frankly a minority interest to be a central part of scottish politic and indeed of united kingdom politic he change they all something that very few of we will be able to do 
 it be a tragedy that at the end of alex ’s career his own party and government turn on he i be not go to elaborate on that today this be not the right place for that but i will put on the record the comment make today by his lawyer david mckie who represent he through those really difficult time of his life mr mckie say 
 alex ’s courage and strength of character over the year period from the scottish government launch an unlawful process against he throughout his criminal trial in which he be clear of all charge by a jury of his peer to his unimpeachable evidence to the parliamentary inquiry be absolutely incredible 
 what he endure the apparatus of the state turn against he would have break many people but not alex i will always remember a truly incredible human being with remarkable insight strength of personality and a stoic restraint which many other could not contemplate 
 alex be a very proud son of scotland but he be also a son of this house of whom we ourselves should be proud i finish by offer my condolence and heartfelt wish to moira the rest of his family and all his wide circle of friend 
 far to those point of order mr speaker it be with a sense of disbelief that we hear the news on saturday afternoon we all have to double check that people be refer to the alec salmond whom we have all get to know so well in year he have become a colossus a huge political figure in scotland it be almost impossible to think of scottish politic without alec salmond 
 alec recruit i to the scottish national party in the 1990 he be a fan of a band i play with i be able to return the favour some time later when i record he another passion alec have be sing let we just say that it be not exactly a huge hit and that it do not bother the chart alec be a man of many talent there be many facet that make up alec salmond watch alec conduct political debate and work a room be to watch a political masterclass in engagement and communication he could do that with a charm that be so effective and beguile that people naturally feel that they want to contribute and be with alec salmond 
 scotland will miss alec we will all miss alec in the scottish national party we must always remember that he come close to deliver what many people think be almost impossible scotland become an independent nation a nation of our own he take the scottish national party from a fringe interest when i be elect it have mp and we have of the vote in scotland and we come so close to secure an independent nation of our own which would never have be possible without the energy charisma and dynamism of alec salmond 
 we be all hurt in the scottish national party today we have lose of the giant of our political movement i hope that everyone extend their sympathy to moira and the rest of the family to his colleague in the alba party and to everyone who work with he throughout all these year in a mission that alec help to shape and design 
 far to those point of order mr speaker it be difficult to overstate the influence that alex salmond have have on the national movement not just in scotland but in wales he have always be a true friend of my party plaid cymru he be respect and will be respect in future for his extraordinary resilience and optimism he make the campaign for scotland ’s independence a political reality and he change the course of his nation that be undeniable 
 as i say alex be a friend to wales and   the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart   have already mention his many facet our former leader dafydd wigley be go to invite alex salmond to speak at a conference on the welsh poet r. s. thomas i do not know how many people would expect that as r. s. thomas and welsh poetry be of alex ’s enthusiasm i extend every sympathy from my party plaid cymru to moira to alex ’s friend and family and to our colleague in our sister party the snp   i be sure that everyone here send they our deep commiseration 
 far to those point of order mr speaker the phrase end of an era be often bandy about but alex ’s parting really do feel like the end of an era 
 we be not friend we have a professional relationship i would say sometimes it be cordial sometimes it be less so because we disagree on some pretty fundamental issue i always respect alex as of the most formidable and indeed ruthless political operator of our generation i think he would welcome that epitaph alex ’s great political triumph be to be both establishment and anti establishment at the same time which be a pretty difficult trick to pull off while he be at moment minister of scotland he be also agitate to break up the united kingdom while at minute he be highly critical of the conservatives he be also rely on conservative msp in the scottish parliament to sustain his minority administration 
 of my job when i be elect in be to keep an eye on alex in the lobby because he have a habit of encourage chat with new conservative mp his line be that if scotland be independent that would be great for they because there would be a perpetual conservative government in england we have recently see that that argument be slightly flawed but i have to ensure that colleague be not tempt by it alex be a skilled debater and that be very often demonstrate in this chamber despite his express wish to leave it he have an authenticity and a common touch that be so often absent from modern politic that be always very evident when see he with his constituent 
 i absolutely share the view of   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   on moira salmond in my dealing with she she be always a very charming and supportive spouse and my heart go out to she and to alex ’s friend and family at this very difficult time 
 i call the chair of the scottish affairs committee 
 far to those point of order mr speaker like my colleague   the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell   and   the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone i serve with alec salmond in the scottish parliament from alec do not always stay when we do sometimes he come back here but he inevitably come back to scotland and he become scotland ’s minister of course even before that as a scot interested in politic i be aware of alec and of his great strength and courage i seem to remember that at point he be not a member of the snp and it be always difficult to rebel against your own party so all credit to he for do so then over a point of principle 
 i be interested in the point make by the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale about the lobby i have hear story from new labour mp who be encourage to think about the way scotland would be after independence but for a different reason it be suggest to they that scotland would always vote in a labour government if we be to be independent which just go to show how astute and i suppose pragmatic alec be as a politician he be   a great performer in whichever chamber he be in and he be always worth listen to obviously my politic and his be very different but i share platform with he on a number of occasion and it be always interesting and an education to listen to what he have to say my thought and prayer go to moira of course and to gail and the wide family as well as to all those who know and love he
