it be a pleasure to speak during what i hope be the final stage of the bill give that nearly all the bills on which i have speak up to now have be money bills this business of come back from the lords and scrutinise lords amendment have not be part of my experience so if i get anything wrong i apologise 
 like other member i want to begin by thank a number of people and organisation include the mental health foundation carnegie uk the internet watch foundation the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children and researcher for the snp aaron lucas and josh simmonds upton for all their work advice knowledge and wisdom i also join the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones and for gosport dame caroline dinenage in thank the family involve for the huge amount of time and energy and the huge amount of themselves that they have have to pour into the process in order to secure   these change this be the beginning of the culmination of all their hard work it will make a difference today and it will make a difference when the bill be enact member in all part of the house will do what we can to continue to scrutinise its operation to ensure that it work as intend to ensure that child be keep as safe as possible online and to ensure that ofcom use these power to persuade platform to provide the information that they will be require to provide follow the death of a child about that child ’s use of social medium 
 the bill be about keep people safe it be a different bill from the that begin its parliamentary journey i think more than year ago i have see various minister lead from the dispatch box during that time but the voice around the chamber have be consistent from the conservative labour and snp benches all the member who have speak have agree that we want the internet to be a safe place i be extremely glad that the government have make so many concession that the opposition party call for i congratulate the hon member for pontypridd on the inclusion of violence against woman and girl in the bill she champion that in committee and i be glad that the government have make the change 
 another change that the government have make relate to small high risk platform back in may or june last year i table amendment and which call for that categorisation to be change so that it be not base just on the number of user i think it be the hon member for gosport who mention 4chan and i have mention kiwi farms a number of time in the chamber such organisation can not be allow to get away with horrific vile content that encourage violence they can not be allow a low bar just because they have a small number of user 
 the national risk register produce by the cabinet office great bedtime read which i thoroughly recommend state that both the risk and the likelihood of harm and the number of people on whom it will have an impact should be take into account before a decision be make it be therefore entirely sensible for the government to take into account both the number of user when it be a significant number and the extremely high risk of harm cause by some of these provider 
 it be a pleasure to follow the speech your mr speaker and those of the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house 
 distinguish under clerk of the parliaments otherwise know as the clerk of the commons be john hatsell in orlo williams ’s great book the clerical organisation of the house of commons hatsell be describe as attract the confidence of lead politician 
 by his sympathetic understanding though he be no sycophant of those in power 
 i think that be the right role for the clerk and for those they lead in the clerks department 
 sir john draw the attention of a commentator in the press gallery year ago a member of a particular party complain that if everyone have to stay foot or metre apart there would not possibly be room for all snp members to perch in their usual seat the commentator write 
 the clerk with the small flash of weariness say most problem could be resolve by common sense and everyone behave in a grow up way common sense and grow up behaviour we may need to keep an eye on clerk benger 
 they add that sir john be 
 a model clerk circumspect bookish fair in the good sense a modest public servant 
 i think that that be the kind of reputation that each person join the clerks department would wish to have whether or not they achieve the high office 
 sir john be in his academic life an expert on martin marprelate ’s tract which basically mock the church of england the style be describe as 
 a heady mixture of nonsense satire protest irony and gossip combine with pungent wit full of the language of the street 
 or unparliamentary language be sir john ’s predecessor sir david natzler here he would say that the tract be good preparation for the intrigue deception and vituperation a member of the house of commons commission have to get use to in the old day 
 mr speaker let i use the word of your predecessor john bercow who say that the clerk ’s department be 
 unstinting selfless formidable and quite exceptional 
 he go on to say that a good clerk be 
 bless with a brilliant brain an understated manner unfaile courtesy and an absolute and undiluted passion for parliament”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 follow his retirement as clerk sir thomas erskine may who like sir john spend time in the library as well as in the clerks department go on to become baron farnborough of hampshire and he hold that role for day before he die make it the short peerage i hope that sir john ’s time at st catharine ’s be long and that when he get to cambridge he will understand what it be like to be a member of the denis thatcher society marry to a person more important than you be his wife professor susan be an expert anglo saxonist i refer those who be interested to her chadwick memorial lecture in on uncertain beginning i think the clerk arrive in cambridge will not be uncertain as the master of st catharine ’s i hope he have as good a time as we hope he have have with we and we thank he for his service

 we be talk about employment on release but what the hon gentleman raise be incredibly important i have visit wormwood scrubs rate of self harm be unacceptably high they vary by place in the woman ’s estate we have a particular issue with self harm we be work closely with the national health service which provide mental health support in prison i be absolutely determined that we bring down level of self harm 
 i call the new shadow minister 
 prison leaver in employment training be less likely to reoffend that mean that education and training for young offender in prison be crucial will the minister say why the government have fail so far to implement a new prison education service it be promise in their party ’s manifesto in implement it in be too little too late 
 i join you mr speaker in welcome the hon lady to her place and similarly look forward to work with she i can bring her good news there be an education service operate in every prison with contract provider we also have additional provision that governor can put in place but for the new service that she mention it be indeed a manifesto commitment the process be well under way i look forward to be able to make further announcement before long 
 what step his department be take to reform the criminal justice system to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step his department be take to reform the criminal justice system to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step his department be take to reform the criminal justice system to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 the crime associate with vawg be abhorrent which be why we have already take significant action to strengthen the criminal justice system ’s response to it include for example through our end to end rape review drive up prosecution and the introduction of new protection for victim through the landmark domestic abuse act much have be do but we be ambitious in want to go far 
 i understand what the minister be say but it take year or more for rape case to come to court and of victim withdraw from the case before they come to trial have the minister have the chance to look at our proposal for specialist rape court in every crown court in the country 
 i crave your indulgence mr speaker may i take this opportunity to pay tribute to   the hon member for cardiff north anna mcmorrin who shadow i for some time and to   the hon member for lewisham west and penge ellie reeves who also do so i wish they both well although give the latter ’s election co ordination role hopefully not too well 
 it remain our priority to deliver swifter access to justice for victim of rape as the hon gentleman say the experience of attend court be incredibly difficult for they that be why we have commit to increase the number of independent sexual violence adviser and independent domestic violence adviser to more than   over the next year in june we announce our ambitious specialist sexual violence support project in crown court aim at improve facility and technology 
 on the hon gentleman ’s specific question i would urge a degree of caution on those proposal list be a judicial prerogative and it be important we retain flexibility in the use of the court estate to maximise the use of court and judge time for a range of offence and to meet the need of the court 
 the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse recognise the issue with the criminal justice system and say 
 the length of time take to investigate and prosecute child sexual abuse case be a matter of significant concern delay within the criminal justice system can add to the harm cause by sexual abuse 
 the experience of a constituent i be help suggest that be still the case what mandatory training for court judicial and other criminal justice be available to ensure that they appropriately support people who have be subject to this abuse 
 it be nice to see the hon lady in her place and it be always a pleasure to answer question from she she highlight an important issue raise by iicsa and historic and current child sexual abuse it be worth remember that the investigation of such crime can be lengthy because of the complexity of the crime and of obtain evidence while training for the judiciary and court be a matter for the judiciary and the judicial college rather than for the government we have be invest in training as have police force across a range of specialism include handle child sexual abuse case it be important that they be handle with sensitivity and with an understanding of the impact that the trauma have have on those who be victim and indeed also those who be witness she touch on a specific case and i be happy to engage with she outwith the chamber if that would be helpful 
 accord to the late research rape charge be take long to be bring forward the average time a victim have to wait for their attacker to be charge just charge be now day over a year that be disgraceful and the situation be get bad when will minister speed up the process and give woman girl and all victim of rape across england and wales the justice they deserve 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the importance of timeliness of the key aim of operation soteria the new model for investigate rape and serious sexual offence that be be roll out to all police force in the come month be to improve timeliness investigation in this space be of necessity often complex and can take a long time the number of rape conviction be at or around the level it be in now the number of case pass by the police to the crown prosecution service for charge be up the number of case charge be up more than and the number of case receive in the crown court be up by more than much have be achieve but she be right to highlight that there be always more that we can and should do in this important space 
 to tackle violence against woman and girl we need a criminal justice system that work part of that be have law that be up to date to deal with the issue that woman face today i have the pleasure of work with my right hon friend the minister on amendment to the online safety bill that will make it a criminal offence to post intimate image online without consent but he i and other know that there be still gap in the law when it come to the making of those image will he give we an indication of when the government intend to bring forward further legislation not only to deal with that but to keep online safety under constant review 
 it have be a pleasure to work with my right hon friend on those amendment to the online safety bill which return to the commons today she be right to highlight the rapidly change environment that we be legislate for and the need therefore to keep thing under constant review although she tempt i i shall resist the temptation to speculate on a forthcoming king ’s speech or any future legislative announcement what i will say which i hope will give she some reassurance be that we have be clear that as soon as legislative time can be find the government be commit to implement the full package of measure in the law commission report 
 whether he have make a recent assessment of the performance of prison in wakefield constituency 
 the most recent annual prison performance rating for be publish in july his majesty ’s prison and young offender institution new hall be rat a which be a matter of concern hmp wakefield be rat a or outstanding 
 his majesty ’s inspectorate of prisons inspect hmp wakefield last year and have several concern include many that remain unaddresse since its previous visit those concern include infrastructure that be in such a poor condition that it need investment insufficient healthcare staff a lack of mental health intervention and too few activity place the prison leadership and staff continue to do the right thing and should be praise but when will the minister play his part and get our prison back on track 
 the hon gentleman be right to talk about the inspectorate of prison report which be a very important part of our system and help to hold the prison service and we to account in the case of wakefield as he mention it be judge a which be reasonably good for safety for respect and for rehabilitation and release planning there be more to do on purposeful activity which i readily accept be a theme we have see in a number of report from different prison over time particularly since covid the inspector also mention the strong leadership at the prison and that the prison be settle we need to continue to make progress but i join the hon gentleman in play tribute to the leadership at that prison and throughout our prison service and to all the brilliant staff who make it what it be 
 what step his department be take to reduce the backlog of criminal court case 
 my hon friend raise an important point and we remain committed to work with our partner across the criminal justice system to try to ensure that court process be as efficient as possible we have introduce a raft of measure to achieve that aim include allow court for a year in a row to sit for an unlimited number of day with extended use of nightingale courtroom in addition we have open permanent super courtroom in manchester and loughborough and be recruit an additional judge across all jurisdiction 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that reply in suffolk the backlog of criminal court case remain stubbornly high which be not only deny victim justice but place a huge burden on the police and cost the local taxpayer a fortune work with suffolk ’s police and crime commissioner tim passmore can my hon friend produce a comprehensive and bespoke plan that clear the backlog and then set out a long term strategy for the efficient functioning of the court in the county 
 i can reassure my hon friend that in suffolk the disposal to march be up by on the previous quarter while the outstanding case load slightly reduce in the same period that reflect the hard work that be do with our partner to ensure that we get through the case load as fast as possible we continue to work with the judiciary to identify how we can get the high workload move more smoothly across the department and work with our partner the crown court improvement group continue to look at good practice and the local criminal justice board will always look at good practice across the country to see what we can do to ensure that his area continue to perform 
 be the minister aware that the criminal court be full of case relate to joint enterprise a terrible miscarriage of justice will he and the justice team promise to meet i and the campaign group jengba joint enterprise not guilty by association to see whether we can clear the justice system of the many people who should never have be in the court 
 the hon gentleman have campaign on that issue for some time and i have meet his colleague   the hon member for edmonton kate osamor to discuss it the data collection do not support the identification of case relate to joint enterprise but i understand that the crown prosecution be now do an exercise on well datum collection to see whether the issue that he continue to raise quite rightly be bear out by the datum and we can see what action we might take to address any injustice 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as   the hon member for waveney peter aldous   point out chaos in our court continue now security guard have vote for strike action after a pay offer worth just 38p an hour above the minimum wage peter slator chairman of ocs which employ the guard say in his annual review 
 this be an exceptional year where our colleague go above and beyond to deliver reliable high quality service for our customer around the world in the most challenging circumstance the reliability and resilience of our frontline colleague during the pandemic have be exceptional 
 i be sure the minister will agree that the government should pay mr slator ’s company enough for he to deliver fair pay will he intervene to stop further chaos in our court 
 our court be not in chaos interruption i be sure that if the hon gentleman take the time to talk to all partner across the criminal justice system they would bear that out all element of the criminal justice system in whatever role they play continue to ensure that it work smoothly the pay award be a matter for the private sector employer i will not intervene 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on justice 
 i be pleased to say that the inaugural meeting of the inter ministerial group on justice be take place this afternoon chair by lord bellamy and attend by the scottish government cabinet secretary for justice angela constance msp as well the counsel general for wales mick antoniw ms that new forum have be establish by an agreement between the nation of the uk it have discuss justice issue of mutual interest 
 i rise as a convinced devolutionist in fact i think i be the only member of this place whose signature be on the claim of right for scotland as and when a new law be agree in edinburgh or cardiff say what mechanism be in place to ensure that any such new law will not disrupt either england or other part of the united kingdom 
 the hon gentleman raise a good point we have more recently see the scottish government attempt to railroad the rest of the uk on gender recognition it be well when our legislature work in tandem for the benefit of all party not when scotland try to disrupt other part of the united kingdom with ill think out legislation 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the government will amend the misuse of drugs act this afternoon that year old piece of legislation control the shape of scotland ’s criminal justice system to punish drug addiction with the full force of the law rather than treat user in health setting as addict with health condition what conversation have the minister   have with cabinet colleague in the scottish government on introduce a safe drug consumption room pilot in glasgow 
 i be not sure base on recent report that that particular pilot be work well i will happily ask colleague to see whether that pilot be work as the hon gentleman say it be but that be not what the newspaper be report the uk government ’s response to it be something for the inter ministerial group which be meet this afternoon 
 i be a bit confused by the minister ’s response there currently be no pilot in glasgow but perhaps there have be some positive discussion between the scottish government and the government here give that there be drug consumption room in more than city across the world support by mountain of evidence from ngos civil society group and drug activist alongside the lord advocate ’s new policy not to prosecute drug user for possession offence commit within a pilot safe drug consumption facility can the minister give an iron clothe commitment that the government will not block this life save health measure 
 how that legislation be deal with be a matter for other colleague but i can reassure the hon gentleman that if treat drug taking as a health issue be work as he suggest it be we will learn from that and discuss it with our colleague in the nhs the broad principle of it be a health issue be be deal with by the nhs and the health secretary in term of legislation that be a matter for cabinet colleague 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the prison estate for housing prisoner 
 we be build modern prison place to help rehabilitate prisoner cut crime and protect the public and we continue to invest in prison maintenance so that exist place remain in use and safe 
 the minister ’s answer be very interesting because let ’s face it our prison have be run down for year many be so old that they be build before raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be even a twinkle in somebody ’s bank account if we read the inspection report as i have it be a list of woe they be draughty damp infest terribly overcrowded and woefully understaffe hardly likely to enable rehabilitation it be our community that endure the consequence with at least of prison leaver reoffende within month it be simply not good enough be it 
 we continue to upgrade the prison estate as i say we be invest in new place the big expansion in the secure estate since the victorian era at the same time we have be take out some of our most overcrowded and unsuitable prison in the last financial year we take out place and we be invest £ in custodial maintenance for and 
 the hon lady mention reoffende there be no good level of reoffende but but i be pleased to be able to report good progress on reoffending which have be come down as a result of more ex offender get into employment few of they be homeless and more be able to get suitable good treatment for addiction 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the justice committee be propose to hold an inquiry into future prison population and estate capacity and i look forward to the minister give evidence to we about that he will know that that be prompt in part by concern that overall overcrowding in the adult male estate be some and it be much bad in many of the old local prison while he be right to draw attention to the government ’s new prison building programme even if that be all complete on time there would accord to figure we have see be a shortfall in march of about place as against anticipated demand what be go to be do to deal with that should we have a proper conversation with the public about what be a reasonable expectation of what can be do in prison what be the good use of prison and who should be there 
 on my hon friend ’s last point of course we must constantly be have an intelligent constructive public debate about these matter on the question of capacity projection change and there be many complex factor at play i look forward as ever to be scrutinise by his committee on that point 
 it be important to note that crowd double up in cell have for a very long time be a feature of our prison system crowd overall be few than it be when we come into government in 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reduce the number of foreign national offender in the prison system 
 between january and december we remove foreign national offender from the country as my hon friend rightly suggest that be all about close work with colleague include in the home office 
 we have all see the story of convict foreign criminal be pull off plane at the last minute the nationality and borders act be bring in to improve the process of return criminal to speed up that process and increase the window for removal of foreign national offender from prison under the early removal scheme could my right hon friend comment on how that scheme be work how he expect it to affect the number and how he expect the process to be speed up 
 as my hon friend mention under the nationality and borders act we expand the fno early removal scheme window from month to month allow for early removal we be work closely with the home office on that in may   we also agree a landmark new deal with albania and we be work to negotiate new prisoner transfer agreement with eu member state and other country 
 i thank the minister very much for that response it have be report that the proportion of northern ireland ’s total jail population who hail from outside the united kingdom and ireland be disproportionately high the figure indicate that it be between and per year have the minister have an opportunity to assess that with the department of justice back home 
 as the hon gentleman know give the way we be organise we do not cover the northern ireland prison service however it be very important that we stay in close touch and although i have not have that specific conversation recently with colleague in northern ireland there will no doubt be opportunity in the future 
 what progress he have make on the sale of reading gaol 
 the sale of reading prison be proceed and bar any unexpected complication completion be expect later this autumn 
 i thank the minister for his answer and for meet i and   the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma   recently to discuss this matter read gaol be a hugely important historic building and nearly people across berkshire have now sign a petition ask the government to work with i and the local art community to turn the gaol into an art hub it have take the government a long time to discuss the propose sale with their preferred bidder and no progress or slow progress appear to be be make will the minister now reconsider the government ’s approach and work with i read borough council and the local art community to save this wonderful building 
 the sale be progress of course any propose development would be subject to approval from read borough council ’s planning department and the usual due diligence requirement and so on will apply 
 we quite often throw around the term doughty campaigner in this chamber but i can certainly say that the hon gentleman and my right hon friend   the member for reading west sir alok sharma his neighbour have be incredibly assiduous in their attention to this matter on behalf of their constituent in turn i commit to he that we will absolutely stay in touch 
 what step his department be take to help ensure that offender attend their sentencing 
 it be right that those convict of a crime face up to its consequence by be in court when they be sentence on   august the lord chancellor announce his intention to legislate as soon as parliamentary time   allow to enable judge to order an offender to attend court for sentencing make it clear in legislation that reasonable force can be use to compel attendance and that refusal to comply with a judge ’s order will cause the offender to face up to year in custody 
 in colin ash smith be convict of murder year old claire tiltman in my constituency of dartford his final insult to she be to refuse to attend the sentencing hearing so i welcome the propose change to compel defendant to face up to the consequence of their action however can the minister confirm that there will be an opportunity for judge to hear representation from the prosecution defence and security staff before such action be take 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and i hope he will allow i this opportunity to express my sympathy to the friend and family of claire tiltman who live in his constituency and in be tragically murder i be glad to see her murderer bring to justice after so many year colin ash smith like lucy letby be cowardly for not attend the sentencing hearing to face up to his appalling crime each case be different so it be important that the court and the judge have discretion in how to make an attendance order and in reach that decision although we be work through the detail we would expect the court to consider the full circumstance of each individual case include any representation make by the prosecution or the defence in that context 
 if we want offender to attend their sentencing it do rather help if the court be open harrow crown court be close and a half week ago because of the discovery of crumble concrete raac with no indication as yet of any timescale for it to be reopen its closure will inevitably exacerbate the backlog of criminal case in the london area and prevent victim of crime from see justice could the minister provide quickly an update on the progress at get harrow crown court modernise fully repair and open again 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman particularly for the dexterity with which he get harrow crown court in he be right to highlight that case i understand that remedial work be under way and that case list there have be transfer to other london court to ensure they still continue to be hear i understand from the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for finchley and golders green mike freer that the indicative timescale to complete the work be to month 
 i welcome the shadow minister kevin brennan it will be quieter on the back benches but no doubt he will make up for it on the front bench 
 thank you mr speaker i suspect the minister might anticipate what i be go to ask he because i be begin to think the department should be rename the department for justice delay labour propose that we change the law on attend sentence back in and just last month the leader of the opposition say that we be prepared to amend the relevant legislation if there   be no action so why be it take so long for the government to intervene on behalf of victim and their family 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman and may i take the opportunity to welcome he to his place i suspect there will occasionally be to and fro across this chamber but i hope there will also be opportunity where we be in agreement to work constructively together we have be clear on our intention to bring forward appropriate legislation to reinforce the exist power the judiciary have in this respect but it be important that we get this right and that it build in that degree of judicial discretion because there may be some circumstance where victim would not wish to see the offender in court for sentencing because it would be deeply distressing or deeply disruptive so it be important that we get this right we be determined to do that but we will work through the detail to make sure it be robust and effective 
 how many staff vacancy there be in prison in england and wales 
 we have recently see indication of an improve national staffing picture in prison with an increase of full time equivalent band to prison officer and youth justice worker in the year to june 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for that answer but the damn report into hmp woodhill just adjacent to my constituency be clear that staff shortage be a huge factor in the serious issue that prison face it be equally well know that hmp spring hill and hmp grendon in my constituency have face recruitment challenge in that light if we can not staff the prison that we do have surely it be unworkable to carry on with my right hon friend ’s totally unwanted plan to build a new mega prison in my constituency and that planning appeal should be withdraw 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who take a close interest in these matter and rightly so particularly on behalf of his constituent who be prison officer and other staff in and around his constituency i can assure he we be work urgently to address the finding and the urgent notification at woodhill i think we will come on to that a little later in question from hon friend the lord chancellor will as ever be publish an action plan by the end of the month we also have active recruitment campaign in place for grendon and spring hill and be seek to increase number by incentivise recruitment 
 what recent assessment he have make of condition at magistrate court 
 i recognise that there continue to be work to be do to improve condition in some magistrate court for the user and that be why we have boost the capital investment programme to £ over the    next year to march to improve the quality and enhance the resilience of the court and tribunal estate allow we to plan major project much more in advance and with certainty the improvement will ensure that those on the frontline of the justice system will benefit from building that be more accessible and sustainable 
 we speak of access to justice mean the availability of legal advice and representation but for too many old and disabled people physical access to justice through the magistrate court in particular be well nigh impossible because the building themselves be not fit for purpose actually not fit for purpose be the term use to describe the magistrate court in the secretary of state ’s constituency by the former police and crime commissioner do we not need more swift action to remedy the problem than the minister have outline 
 i take quite a bit of time to read the report from the magistrates association on inaccessible court to ensure that where we can make reasonable adjustment we make they and that where we need to make more substantial investment to make the court more accessible particularly to make they compliant with the disability discrimination act we do so and those work be prioritise we continue to work on new court as in blackpool and the city of london to ensure that the estate be modernise and we have court that be accessible and fit for purpose the point be well make and it be in hand 
 what training be provide to magistrate to help ensure impartial decision making 
 to preserve the independence of the judiciary the lord chief justice have a statutory responsibility for the training of the judiciary under the constitutional reform act and that include magistrate and their legal adviser magistrate and the legal adviser who support they in court must complete induction training before hear case and once magistrate be sit continuation training be provide on regular cycle impartial decision making be weave throughout all the material 
 i thank the minister for his answer chris pincher and i have be work very closely to ensure that the police act strongly and swiftly in shenstone near lichfield over constant demonstration at an israeli company that supply arm to the british armed force people go to trial at a magistrate court in walsall and they be acquit it be report we do not know for sure because it be not a court of record that the judge say 
 on the principle of proportionality their action be proportionate in comparison to the crime against humanity which they be act to stop 
 by the israelis i think that if it be true be outrageous what can be do within the judicial system to ensure that that sort of thing do not happen if indeed it do 
 my hon friend raise an important point about the independence of the judiciary we have to be careful that we do not rely on report by a party perhaps with a vested interest because these case be not report officially however if he wish to discuss any point of law that may lead to an appeal from the prosecute authority he can do so and i be happy to work with he and guide he on how that may be take up with the attorney general in term of any complaint about the behaviour of the judiciary there be a clearly define process that i be happy to discuss with my hon friend after today ’s session 
 what step he be take to increase recruitment to the probation service 
 at   june   just over people be work in the probation service an increase of just over or compare with   june   the previous year 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer horrific case those of jordan mcsweeney and damien bendall show how vital it be to have effective supervision of recently release offender what lesson have be learn from those case and will the minister provide an update on the action be take to address problem in the probation service cause by high vacancy rate and consequentially unmanageably large case load for probation staff 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend and again i express my sincere condolence to the family of zara aleena terri harris connie gent and john and lacey bennett we have increase probation staff in the london area by over the last year and that include trainee probation officer in post the service have accept all the chief inspector ’s recommendation in respect of the appalling case that my right hon friend mention and it be implement robust action plan especially with regard to improve risk assessment 
 whether he have hold recent discussion with the welsh government on develop community base alternative to imprisonment for female offender serve short sentence 
 minister engage regularly with colleague in the welsh government include discussion on female offender and alternative to custody both government work closely on deliver the woman ’s justice blueprint for wales on female offending 
 short sentence for woman often do more harm than good reinforce trauma and lead to far reoffende in third of sentence for immediate custody for woman be for less than month it be anticipate that more woman will be in prison by how do the secretary of state   justify the grow female prison population and the use of short sentence give wales ’s ambition to divert as many woman as possible away from prison 
 the woman ’s population in prison have come down and sentencing be a matter for the judiciary and not something in which the government intervene it be important that suitable alternative to custody be available and i join the right hon lady in pay tribute to the people run woman ’s centre for example which do a fantastic job specifically for woman as well as to the broad set of alternative and community sentence option it be important that we make sure we continue to work on those include work together with the welsh government 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i have be ask to reply on behalf of the lord chancellor who have be in riga attend a council of europe meeting where a political declaration be sign on support for the ukrainian justice system he be sorry not to be here for these oral question and he have ask i to convey to the house his thank to the metropolitan police for their quick work in find and return daniel khalife to custody the independent investigation that the lord chancellor commission must now get to the bottom of this serious breach since the last oral question the government have also announce that we will make whole life order the expectation in sentencing where they can be apply we have also outline plan to order the bad offender to attend court for their sentencing hearing we want to ensure that the bad offender receive their sentence in the full glare of the courtroom and that victim have the opportunity to set out the impact the crime have have on they 
 with government spending for housing legal aid fall in the past decade from £ to £ and the spending for disrepair case fall from nearly £ to just over £ it be not a moment too soon that the government have begin to restore some legal aid with the housing loss prevention advice service due to the government ’s disastrous legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act many housing legal aid provider shut up shop leave of the population of england and wales without a single provider in their local authority area and with no access to welfare legal aid what recent analysis have the minister make of legal aid desert and what step be he take to remedy the situation 
 we be put more money into legal aid and criminal legal aid follow the independent review specifically on housing which the hon lady mention we be inject an additional £ from   august 
 what conversation have my right hon friend have across government to make sure that the   sentencing for those convict of dangerous cycling be equalise with the sentencing guideline for those convict of dangerous driving 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend who i know take a keen interest in this issue the safety of our road be a key objective for the government and protect all road user be a priority like all road user cyclist have a duty to behave in a safe and responsible manner while law be in place for cyclist they be old and it can be difficult to successfully prosecute offence that be why department for transport colleague be consider bring forward legislation to introduce new offence concern dangerous cycling to tackle those rare instance where victim have be kill or seriously injure by irresponsible cycling behaviour 
 i welcome the new shadow secretary of state to her post 
 i thank the minister for the update about daniel khalife but the fact remain that hmp wandsworth have be a know problem for the good part of a decade with a litany of failure include overcrowding staffing and security issue khalife be not even the escape from wandsworth there be an incident in which the chief inspector of prison say be the result of a serious security breach why after so many warning about wandsworth have the government fail to act 
 we take these matter extremely seriously the independent investigation will of course look at the question the hon lady raise specifically about the incident to ensure that lesson be learn if we look at the independent review of progress from his majesty ’s inspectorate we see that progress have be make in wandsworth particularly on staffing which i know have rightly be a matter of considerable public interest there have be an increase of some in staffing specifically at wandsworth since 
 year of warning and year of inaction i be afraid that rather sum the government up on sunday the justice secretary tell we that prisoner have be move from wandsworth claim that that be out of an abundance of caution will the minister tell we how many other prisoner will have to be move across the whole prison estate as a result of this escape what the public want to see be not an abundance of caution after the fact of an escape but an abundance of certainty that the prison estate be secure be it 
 it be the hon lady would not expect i to get into a running commentary on transfer arrangement when we be talk about security i want to reassure she the house and the public that escape from prison be very rare and much rarer now than they use to be the number of escape from prison in the last year since be considerably low than it be in the year before 
 to encourage active travel people need to feel confident use our road yet the court can impose only the   same penalty on multiple offender as on a timer will my right hon friend consider the introduction of escalate penalty for repeat traffic offence 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the issue of traffic offence as part of the police crime sentencing and courts act there be an increase in the minimum disqualification period for the serious offence of cause death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drug from year to year and an increase from to year if there be a repeat offence within year the department for transport be also currently consider a broad call for evidence on motor offence i hope that the very recent report from the all party parliamentary group for cycling and walking will be useful to it in that respect i will ensure that colleague at the dft be aware of her interest in this issue 
 as the absurdity of terrorist offender in low category prison play out be it not time to free up space by remove julian assange from belmarsh maximum security facility where he have languish since april guilty only of a minor bail breach when his real offence be expose war crime regardless of his place of incarceration will the minister ensure that he be able to attend proceeding in person which he have be deny since january give all the comment about people be at court 
 i think the hon gentleman have achieve his objective to get something on the record i will not comment on ongoing case but speak more generally access to justice be at the heart of what we do 
 i have a constituent who suffer life change injury as a result of an assault year ago she be not on her own on that basis but she be award only £ from a compensation order during the criminal case and offer £ from the criminal injuries compensation authority will the minister look at amend the victims and prisoners bill so that victim can be give adequate care compensation from offender and support through the court and importantly through the cica 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend who throughout her time in the house and particularly while home secretary have always take a keen interest in support victim of crime it be vital that victim get the compensation they be entitle to be that from the offender or the criminal injury compensation scheme which pay out more than £ in the making of a compensation order be a matter for the court and there be no limit on the amount that a court can order an offender to pay 
 in respect of the criminal injury compensation scheme his majesty ’s government be consult on change follow the report of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse alongside previous consultation it be important that that can be consider fully but that will be post passage of the victims and prisoners bill 
 of my constituent tell i that they be at risk of lose their home because of how long they have have to wait for a benefit decision appeal will the   minister outline what step his department be take to reduce the current week waiting time for benefit decision appeal to be hear 
 across the whole tribunal process the team will constantly monitor who be perform and who be not and will share good practice if the hon lady would like to write to i with the detail of a particular case i can investigate the particular cause of delay 
 parliament pass a law in that offender convict of a or subsequent knife offence should go to prison yet in the year to march such offenders—37 of the total dodge a jail sentence altogether that be the high total since the law be introduce will ministers ensure that the court now hand down the sentence legislate for in this house year ago 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the scourge of knife crime and the need for tough sentence although sentencing in an individual case be a matter for our independent judiciary which be able to consider the specific circumstance of individual case in legislate on this issue parliament be clear about its seriousness that be reflect in average sentence for all type of knife crime which be up from month in to month in in addition of those commit repeat offence be give a custodial sentence include suspend sentence which be a custodial sentence 
 i have a number of constituent whose asylum appeal be allow by court and tribunal service but have now be thrust into limbo while the case go back to the home office for approval what conversation have ministers have with their home office colleague on clear the backlog that be prevent my constituent from get on with their life 
 i be always happy to look at individual case to see if there be specific issue cause a delay broadly speak i work with colleague at the home office and the solicitor general ’s office to see what we can do to ensure that any delay in the process be smooth out so that people do not have to wait for their day in court 
 what review if any have the department carry out to ensure that when court extend bail they ensure that the police be deal with their investigation diligently and expeditiously 
 my hon friend raise an important point for her constituent i must stress that the independence of the judiciary be fundamental to the rule of law and the running of the justice system therefore the department have not and will not conduct a review into how the judiciary undertake its function in individual case however i can reassure she that the judiciary ensure that the relevant agency that it work with undertake their function smoothly and effectively 
 be it not the case that last minute cancellation in magistrate court be largely cause by the inability to recruit and retain legal adviser who be pay a lot less than other government legal adviser what step will the minister take to ensure an increase in wage and well term and condition for those legal adviser will he sit down with the pcs union to try to resolve this intolerable situation 
 we look carefully at why all case be vacate in fact the big cause of vacation be often the non availability of prosecution or defence counsel not of legal executive 
 may i put it to ministers that the month wait for grant simple probate be unfair on people try to sell their parent home i fail to get the probate service to work and i have a constituent who have write to the prime minister will minister please sort it out 
 the time take once all require document be receive be between and week we always advise that no should take a decision on the sale of a property until probate be grant but i can reassure my hon friend that despite a significant increase in application the service be recruit and train up more than new caseworker to ensure that it deliver the service that my hon friend want as do i. 
 last month the united nations call for an urgent government review of sentence of imprisonment for public protection will the secretary of state listen to the un can he explain why the number of people with an ipp sentence recall to prison without commit any further offence have soar in recent year 
 i can confirm that the lord chancellor and i and we all be very conscious of the difficulty around ipp sentence which would not be introduce today we abolish they as the hon lady know but there be people in prison who have be recall or not release by the parole board because they have not be consider safe for release our objective be to help to manage people towards safe release into the community to that end our recently announce action plan be central 
 the rehabilitation of offender be so important in reduce the chance of they commit crime once release from prison especially if they can get back into work could the minister outline any scheme that help to give offender the skill they need and how they can access company that be willing to give they a chance in life 
 my hon friend be so right in topical question i do not have the time to start to unpack all the different thing i would like say so i will not suffice it to say that brilliant company be provide training opportunity 
 i have write to the secretary of state about the tragic case of my young constituent gregg   mcguire he have agree to meet with i and i be very grateful do his department have any plan to reassess the current rule which mean that victim family be unable to appeal sentence for those convict of cause death by careless driving 
 i be grateful to the hon lady i know she be meet the secretary of state to discuss this matter and i do not want to pre empt that meeting if she wish i be very happy to join that meeting with she or even to meet she separately to talk about this issue if she feel that would be helpful 
 mr speaker you will not believe this but it be almost month since i finally secure a meeting with the justice minister and the health minister after cancellation about what happen to section of my civil partnerships marriages and death registration etc act which empower coroner to investigate stillbirth i be assure that the law pass by this house in february and with a consultation that close in june would be publish imminently and progress would be make but nothing have happen be it ever go to happen 
 yes it will both the health minister and i be push this as fast as we possibly can 
 the scale of the illegal drug problem in prison be such that year ago the government introduce a programme that cost £ have the problem get bad or improve in the time since 
 we be see progress it be a combined approach of drug recovery wing and incentivise subsidise free living and ensure that security be able to stop drug get into prison through thing like x ray body scanner which we have deploy in many prison 
 it be perhaps unfortunate that many member of the public and much of the medium only take an interest in prison when there be an escape but that be thankfully very rare will my right hon friend join i in hop to now see a calm and measure public debate about the role of prison not least work out way to improve rehabilitation which ultimately protect the public 
 my hon friend be exactly right he have a long history with this issue since before he reach this house it be ultimately all about rehabilitation reduce reoffende and help to keep the public safe 
 over woman have sign a public letter to the prime minister ask he to take action against the escalate campaign of threat and intimidation against woman who stand up for woman ’s right many of these woman be particularly concerned that the institution suppose to protect they be fail to do so include the criminal justice system will the minister with responsibility for victim be good enough to meet i and representative of those who organise the letter to discuss this important issue 
 i be always happy to meet the hon and learn lady 
 the reputation of our justice system depend on the independence integrity and professionalism of our judge at the end of this month the right hon lord burnett of maldon will retire as lord chief justice to be succeed by dame susan carr who will be the ever female lord chief justice will the minister place on the record in this house his appreciation and all our appreciation of lord burnett for the exceptional leadership he have show to the judiciary throughout his term in office 
 i be grateful to my hon friend i know the lord chief justice and i be very happy on behalf of his majesty ’s government and all those on the government front bench to do exactly as my hon friend say to pay tribute to lord burnett ’s exemplary period as lord chief justice 
 i would like to pay tribute to the campaigner who challenge joint enterprise as a result the crown prosecution    service have now commit to monitor who be prosecute i welcome the report at the end of this month but will the minister commit to an audit of all joint enterprise conviction particularly as more black people be disproportionately impact 
 i can commit to wait until we have see what the work be do by the cps uncover once we have datum we can then have a rational discussion on the next step 
 be the minister aware of the prevalence of the unfounded and unscientific concept of parental alienation within our family court it be cause suffering and in some case violence against woman and girl what step be the department take to ensure that the court recognise the harm of this discredit concept 
 the department be well aware of the concern which be why the matter be currently under review the result of that review include publication of all the datum and research behind the outcome will be publish later this year 
 urgent question   to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if she will make a statement on the implication for offshore wind of contract for difference allocation round 
 the annual contract for difference auction the that we have ever do be complete last week and deliver a total of gw of renewable electricity with contract go to a record number of project the auction deliver significant quantity of new solar and onshore wind generation as well as support new tidal stream project and for the time geothermal project it be a competitive auction set against a backdrop of highly challenging macroeconomic condition that have impact the sector globally give that this be our annual round it be to be expect that it would have a low capacity than the previous biennial round and because last year ’s round be the for year a high annual element than that record round 
 the government remain committed to offshore and float offshore wind project and this round provide valuable learning for subsequent auction work have already start on allocation round incorporate the result of the recent round and we look forward to a strong pipeline of technology be able to participate the move to annual auction mean that allocation round will open in just month time in march which mean that there could be minimal or indeed no delay in the deployment of new capacity through that round 
 the government also remain committed to our target of decarbonise the power system by and our ambition for gw of offshore wind include up to gw of float offshore wind our trajectory for meet these aim as well as our legally bind carbon budget target be not linear the outcome for technology in auction do not prevent we from reach those goal 
 what a load of nonsense no wonder the secretary of state be in hiding 
 this auction be an energy security disaster for britain and an act of economic self- harm on the part of the government no new offshore wind project mean that family energy bill will £ high and our energy security will be weaken bad of all this be totally avoidable minister be warn again and again about the impact of high inflation in a letter from renewableuk in march and again in july and offshore wind be so much cheap than gas that they could have raise the price in the auction and it would still have save billion of pound for family but they refuse to listen 
 will the minister tell we why the government ignore those repeat warning secondly he say on friday that every country be in the same boat but that be just wrong ireland listen to industry and adjust its price and have a successful auction in march why do the government not learn that lesson thirdly be not the terrible truth that this episode reveal a much   deep flaw in their approach for month after month this summer they claim that the answer to our energy crisis be more oil and gas and this be the result we will now be more dependent on expensive insecure fossil fuel we will be more expose to the whim of petrostate and dictator every wind farm that we fail to build make we more expose to dictator like putin and he know it 
 bill high security bad job lose climate failure the government have trash offshore wind the crown jewel of our energy system raise bill just as they trash onshore wind by ban it raise bill and just as they trash home insulation raise bill we have see year of fail energy policy and all this fiasco show be that the conservatives be quite simply a party unfit to govern 
 i be pleased to see the other day that the rumour of the right hon gentleman no long be in his position be not true it be perhaps understandable in that context that he be so passionate about this highly successful round that have see gw on an annualise basis i think that be a record round he be a member of the previous labour government who leave this country with of its electricity come from renewable in the quarter of this year of our electricity be from renewable it be this government with our contract for difference system who transform the economic of offshore wind we have gw of offshore wind in the pipeline more than enough we have 7.5—[interruption the right hon gentleman understandably give the weakness of his argument want to heckle at all time know how easy it be to dismantle they he ask i where that capacity be and i can tell he that gw be currently under construction 
 as ever the right hon gentleman fail to be on the side of consumer we move to an annualise auction precisely to ensure that we could learn the lesson from each round add they to our industry insight and ensure that we could move forward the project take multiple year to be develop and none of they have disappear i predict that move on from the triumph of gw of renewable which come through successfully on friday allocation round will be more successful still we will continue to build our reputation as the country that have cut emission more than any other major economy and that have transform our electricity generation he mention insulation how he have the gall i do not know we have move from of home be properly insulate when he leave power to over by the end of this year 
 i thank the minister for his engagement with this process particularly with the new technology of float offshore wind float offshore wind project be due to bid in allocation round but none do due to the low administrative strike price as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the celtic sea i have repeatedly be tell that these project be part of our future energy supply can he outline what step he be take to ensure that these project will float in allocation round and to give confidence to developer in the region 
 i thank my hon friend who be an absolute champion of float wind and the economic opportunity it offer for her area and the rest of the   uk i be delighted to speak to her last week and meet she yesterday and i pay tribute to her effort we have the large float wind pipeline in the world base on confirm seabed exclusivity arrangement we have around gw already identify include through the scotwind lease round and innovation and targeted oil and gas intog process as she as a great champion know the crown estate be move forward with its leasing round for up to gw of capacity in the celtic sea this year we have be the world leader on float energy and we be go to stay the world leader thank to the effort of my hon friend i know that we will have support across the house 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the minister fail to point out that gw be scarcely half of what be achieve in auction round he also fail to mention when he be herald onshore wind that of that will be find in scotland since the auction round have yield gw gw gw and gw so a nil return be an utter catastrophe 
 the critical need for massive investment in offshore be patently obvious for bill and for the climate yet this ambition have be thwart by an incompetent previous secretary of state and by the treasury which know the price of everything and the value of nothing can the minister assure we that the department will get round the table with industry as a matter of urgency to try to repair this damage industry need a strike price that reflect the not mutually exclusive goal of low bill net and job and investment in scotland and elsewhere can he confirm whether a recovery group for auction round will be convene by he or the secretary of state to try to get this catastrophe resolve and where be she 
 the hon gentleman and his party never fail to trash this country—[interruption he can heckle all he wish i will be meet industry representative this afternoon and as i have say we will be announce in month time the price ceiling for the next round—[interruption i be get heckling not least from his majesty ’s opposition who leave we in that parlous situation we be the world leader in so many of these technology and we be go to continue to be if   the hon member for angus dave doogan   be to recognise the need to attract investment to this country and not talk it down he might find that scottish job would be even strong in the pipeline than they be already 
 if any how much of the complete wind capacity still require connection to the national grid 
 until wind capacity be construct it be not normally connect to the grid that which have not be connect to the grid will need to be connect to the grid 
 i call the chair of the select committee on energy security and net 
 the boom and bust of this fiasco will inevitably have knock ons for the supply chain how concerned be the minister about that also how concerned be he about project that be build on cfd security but have not invoke the contract and be now literally rake in the windfall of that act 
 i do not quite follow the part of the hon gentleman ’s question but i be happy to write to he on that topic 
 west somerset as the minister know be ideal for offshore wind i be interested to know why people do not bid in this round what be their reason what can the government do to learn the lesson of this round so that people like my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   can make sure that people be bid in the next round 
 we typically set out the key auction parameter in november and those include the ceiling of what we will pay for particular technology we do that base on our analysis of supply chain cost and we also commission external analysis the most important datum of all come from individual auction round and it be on that basis that we set the price parameter the industry warn we as it do every year that it want we to pay more we always have to make a judgment call between make sure that we minimise—[interruption it would be so much easy to give my answer mr speaker if   the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband   would stop 
 order i think that as a man who be always happy to heckle from the back benches the minister deserve a little bit himself 
 we set the price and we immediately learn from each auction of the reason for have an annual auction be that we can quickly adjust and as i say project can then come into the next round with minimal delay 
 the wind farm off brighton have probably become as iconic as the pier itself but the reality be that the government ’s failure will delay the construction of more of these beautiful installation around our coast be this failure not also a failure of the market base private investment system that this government be determined to pursue rather than a publicly own and co ordinated building programme that can work alongside private investment so that we no long have this failure where nobody bid 
 i thank the hon gentleman for reveal the true face of where the labour party be go we can go back to the day when we have hardly any renewable and we can allow great british energy or whatever labour be go to call its creature to squeeze out private investment and destroy the most successful renewable market in europe and to destroy this government ’s progress on tackle the parlous position leave behind by the right hon member for doncaster north and his friend we will continue to be the world leader in cut emission but not if we   move to the state run left wing obsession of colleague like   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle 
 offshore wind play and will continue to play a key strategic role in enhance energy security achieve net and revitalise coastal community such as lowestoft to get back on track can my right hon friend confirm that the criterion apply to round will take account of current economic reality that appropriate fiscal measure be be consider ahead of the autumn statement and that specific focus will be give to enhance local supply chain 
 i thank my hon friend who have be such a consistent champion not only for the power of renewable to meet our environmental challenge but for the economic benefit that come from they he be absolutely right that the nature of the cfd system be that it learn from the previous auction round which be the most real datum of all and use that learn to inform the next round that be why i be confident that just as we have a success with gw on friday ar6 promise to be more successful still 
 i congratulate the minister on turn complacency and chutzpah into a new art form the ineptitude of tory ministers mean that this late cfd round see the small auction return since a failing that be entirely avoidable how will he ensure that the uk deliver the gw of new offshore wind capacity that be need in just year why do ministers yet again fail to heed the warning from industry and expert in advance 
 we have to set the parameter base on the good information we have as i say reason for move to an annual round be to allow we quickly to learn the lesson of each round we do not get the wind on this occasion which i regret and we will put the real world price and learning from that into the next round that be the system we have because we be always try to make sure that we get the parameter right so that we balance the need to generate additional green energy with the cost to the taxpayer understandably give their carelessness with the public finance and with consumer the opposition do not seem to care about that my job be to balance it ensure that we get the generation and we have gw in the pipeline we be in position and on track to meet our ambition which lead europe not that we would know that to listen to the hon lady 
 i thank the minister for include geothermal project in allocation round as that be very welcome however i echo everything my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   say about the celtic sea project what will we do differently in round what advice would he give to those in the supply chain specifically port that be try to submit application for the flowmis float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme funding what conversation have he have about grid capacity to ensure that all of this eventually run smoothly 
 as ever my hon friend be well inform we be work on all those front flowmis application close just week ago and we be work flat out to analyse they i hope that by the end of the year we will have shortlist to the primary list and those scheme will move forward to due diligence as we take forward not only our float wind deployment but the supply chain in the south west wales scotland and around the rest of the uk we be work on all those front and be determined to do that as she rightly highlight see our geothermal project come through the cfd be fantastic as be the tidal project i pay tribute to all colleague who have work so hard to promote tidal energy and make sure that we continue to be a world leader in that as well 
 this be an embarrassment for the government and show that we be fall far and far behind in the race for green job internationally we have the low growth in these industry among the big economy should the government not be focus much more on broaden and increase the capacity of offshore wind rather than not listen to industry and make fatal error 
 if the labour party be not nationalise or create some state own behemoth it want just to hurl money in the direction of business our judgment be to balance those thing and i be pleased to say that we have be successful we have the large offshore wind sector in europe this country and this government through the cfds transform the economic from the situation we inherit after the right hon member for doncaster north and his colleague have be in power 
 deliver on the float offshore wind project in the celtic sea be vital for our energy security and decarbonisation do the minister agree that we now need to bolster confidence in this emerge industry there be thing he can do do he agree that a successful allocation of flowmis money to the south wales port in order to get this industry move be vital do he also agree that we need to ensure that the crown estate ’s leasing round at the end of the year be do successfully but with more than gw of visibility in order to send a strong market signal to the industry to invest 
 my right hon friend be also someone who through thick and thin promote that industry and see the opportunity it offer wales he make a special bid for the welsh port as i would expect he to do but he will understand that i can make no comment on that i entirely agree with he on the importance of the crown estate round suffice it to say that across government we have be work flat out with his and other colleague support to support the crown estate to ensure that we maximise the opportunity in the celtic sea 
 the government ’s obsession with oil and gas have leave we in this mess the department have prioritise new oil and gas licence over support for wind power which fly in the face of our climate change commitment and our responsibility to uk citizen our constituent to keep energy price   low oil and gas will always be more expensive than wind energy when will the minister fill the gap of gw of offshore wind that we have now miss out on which would have save consumer £ a year i be not talk about the auction round i be talk about the where we have miss out now 
 the hon lady be completely mistaken we be work flat out both to reduce demand for fossil fuel in this country and to build up our renewable i would hope she would celebrate the fact that we have the large offshore wind sector in europe 
 the government have long be warn that their focus on cfds as the primary mechanism for finance new renewable risk undermine investor confidence in infrastructure asset with long lifespan but significant up front capital cost such as nuclear and tidal range generation follow the government ’s decision to employ a regulated asset base model to support the development of new nuclear will the minister now commit to look urgently at the optimum financial model for new tidal range project which could make a crucial contribution to the future uk energy mix 
 the cfd scheme be among the most successful if not the most successful of its sort in the world we always look at way in which we can improve it we be look at bring in non price factor as we finesse it but the opposition party ’s idea of some state run enterprise squeeze out private investment would destroy the opportunity go forward we need at least another £ to be invest by and if the labour party ever do threaten to come into power it would put all that at risk 
 on teesside we have be promise thousand of job in the offshore wind industry but investor be get a little nervous as a direct result of government failure to provide the right business environment what will the minister do to get the business environment right to deliver the job we have be promise which be be put in jeopardy by government failure 
 we be get that balance right and we will continue to do so make sure that we look after the consumer be always my guide light and we balance that with get the generation we need we have see company such as seah invest in teesside and sumitomo look at invest in scotland 
 they be get nervous 
 as the hon gentleman decry this and talk both the area and the nation down he then tell i that investor be get nervous if he be to champion all the success we have have instead of decry they he might find that he would give investor even more confidence still 
 i do not agree with the policy that the minister pursue his net policy be disastrous and have be costly in term of electricity price and future planning however i feel   some sympathy for he today he be be criticise by those who have highlight high energy price for not offer inflated price to the wind industry which claim that produce wind energy be get cheap but of course want high price as it be not offer that it would not bid in the auction be the real reason for this not that for the time he have refuse to allow those who bid to walk away from their cfd agreement to price electricity at whatever price they want and therefore to have inflate profit do that not indicate to he that the wind industry know it can not produce electricity cheaply and want the system balance in its favour 
 the right hon gentleman and i do not see eye to eye on net or on the economic benefit of the wind industry it do offer cost effectiveness it have be amazing to see how as it be scale it have be able to bring the price down it be not obvious when we go out into the north sea that we would be able to bring the price crash down yet this country lead the world in do that if he look at the number i hope he will find that the whole of this house can agree on thing offshore wind be an economic way of produce energy and that all of we should support 
 last week the think tank common wealth make the critical point 
 reliance on market coordination leave the transition vulnerable to the demand of private capital 
 it be abundantly clear that private capital can not deliver what be urgently require to stem the climate crisis in wales the welsh government know that which be why over the summer they launch the community own renewable energy company ynni cymru do the minister agree that that be what be require and what action be he take to address this 
 i thank the hon lady for pull back the veil on labour ’s real policy which be that it hat private capital it hat private investment and it would destroy the phenomenal success of this country in generate that interruption the front benchers can heckle all they like but that be what their back benchers want that be the policy that threaten the british people and threaten our path to net we must make sure that people such as the hon lady never have power in this country 
 scottish renewables have say that the result be a major blow to the renewable sector in scotland and should serve as an indication that urgent reform be need scottish renewables not a political party but part of the industry have also say that these disastrous result be bad for scotland ’s energy supply chain which desperately need a steady stream of project to make its own investment in skille up and in new technology will the minister acknowledge that his and his department ’s failure to listen to warning from the industry be hold back scotland ’s renewable sector 
 i thank the hon and learn lady for her question industry always ask to be pay more money our job be to make the right judgment call on get the balance right 
 i see in the newspaper yesterday that astronomer have discover a water cover planet in a far away galaxy i have to disappoint these excited scientist that from his answer today the minister appear to have get there before they interruption on another planet yes 
 seriously though this setback to the erebus project in south west wales be deeply disappointing it be the of its kind in wales and be suppose to pave the way to a develop industry i hope the minister can reassure i that he be take step to make sure that in ar6 project such as erebus be enable to compete successfully and to lead the way for this industry in wales 
 i thank the hon gentleman not least for his attempt at a gag i can tell he that what he say be the whole basis of the system that it learn from each round the most real economic datum that we get be from an auction round move to annual round there will be ebb and flow as the right balance be seek between get the generation that we require set against our extremely ambitious deadline and not pay too much that be the balance that we strike we have gw and i imagine that we will do even well next time 
 i feel as if i be almost take my life in my hand but i do want to commend the minister for small piece of good news in this round which be in relation to the development of marine renewable the success of the auction for tidal stream development illustrate what would be possible for wave power if it be to be give the same opportunity in ar6 but for tidal stream do the minister agree that what be now need be the gw target for deployment will he work with i and other people in the house with an interest in this and the marine renewable sector itself to deliver that ahead of ar6 
 may i pay tribute to the right hon gentleman i meet he in his constituency when i visit the european marine energy centre and see for myself some of the project in the water i be personally determined to ensure that tidal stream continue to grow we maintain our global leadership with a very high percentage uk supply chain as a far positive to it he tempt i to get ahead of myself on policy but i can not do that however what we be do and what our dedicated pot this year do be far strengthen that so that we can get in a position where that might be a realistic policy position to take 
 even with a high price offshore wind would help to slash bill when the minister see the irish government recognise inflation up the price and proceed to a successful auction what discussion do he have with the industry and with treasury colleague about the price to be set 
 i thank the hon lady for her question which be a good obviously we do look at whether intervention give that price continue to change after they be set be the right thing to do we think that the cfd mechanism the way that it be operate be sound and that the good thing to do be to allow that to pass for the year reason for have the annual auction be   precisely to allow we quickly to adjust and as i say as soon as november we will be set the parameter for the next year 
 last november the government pay up to £ to china general nuclear corporation to buy out china ’s state own nuclear power enterprise from sizewell c and we spend the good part of free ourselves from our reliance on russian oil and gas give the failure of this government to sell offshore wind project in the late round can the minister please comment on how energy independence from authoritarian state be serve by this inability to run an auction 
 we be now run these auction every year and every year we will be seek to get the generation that we require at the low possible cost to the consumer i make no apology for do that the fact that we have the most successful system not only in europe but globally be something that should be applaud and recognise 
 the windsor report last month provide a sobering analysis about the scale of new electricity transmission infrastructure require to serve increase renewable generation and consumer demand in a very short space of time however as the report find there be considerable resistance locally to pylon development as we be find out in my constituency competence for such development be with the welsh government but will the minister pull together a work group of ministers from across the uk and expert to consider the windsor report and in particular the advantage of cable ploughing technology which would underground those cable at a comparable cost to overhead pylon without the visual damage 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his constructive and effective question he be absolutely right to highlight the challenge of make sure that we have the right transmission and connection infrastructure to facilitate offshore wind we have to do that in a way that minimise negative impact on community that reward they for host it and that look at new technology and innovation just as we do in other area in order to facilitate that effective connection with minimal negative impact on community that host 
 in light of the disappointing result of the cfd ar5 auction and give that i be always try to be constructive in my contribution in this house will government revisit the exclusion of northern ireland renewable project from the scheme especially in light of the significant increase in onshore wind and tidal stream project support by the ar5 northern ireland be perfectly position for onshore wind and tidal stream to make a major contribution to energy security and net from ar6 and beyond will the minister commit to enable northern ireland to be part of ar6 
 i suggest that it be the hon gentleman and his colleague who need to commit to facilitate that in northern ireland energy be devolve and it be up   to they to get the devolved assembly up and run if they get devolved government go in northern ireland they will unleash these opportunity it be not for this department which be not responsible for energy in northern ireland 
 that complete the urgent question 
 on a point of order mr speaker st leonard ’s in my constituency be of the school affect by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete last week we receive a ministerial statement from the secretary of state for education but this week despite raac still be an issue we have hear nothing from the secretary of state or a minister the issue may be yesterday ’s news to some but it be a very real issue for my constituent many of whom have write to i to express their anger and anxiety about this avoidable crisis may i please seek your guidance mr speaker as to how we can implore the secretary of state to come back to the house this week preferably tomorrow when it be well attend and update we on what her department be do
