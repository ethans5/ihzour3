with permission madam deputy speaker i would like to update the house on the conflict in ukraine as we prepare to mark year since the start of the full scale russian invasion 
 like many in this house i remember exactly where i be on   february just before sunrise i be wake by a phone call to be tell that russia have illegally invade ukraine and that a car would be outside at am head for cobra after that meeting ministers be all ask to speak to their respective ukrainian counterpart at the time i be transport secretary and my arrangement be to speak via zoom with my then opposite number oleksandr kubrakov oleksandr who i have subsequently get to know very well be stand in the middle of a field outside kyiv i ask he about the situation and he tell i that quite frankly he do not know how much long the city would last the russian army be understand to be just kilometre away the wolf or in this case the russian bear be literally at the door and expert opinion suggest that kyiv would be take in perhaps day 
 however as this war drag into its year far from win russia have be push back since those early day putin have achieve none of his strategic objective his invade force have suffer a staggering casualty and ukraine have destroy or damage about of the russian black sea fleet and retake of the territory that russia steal from it 
 meanwhile oleksandr kubrakov be now the deputy prime minister and his job be the restoration of ukraine when this be over putin arrogantly assume that this conflict would be over in day and he be wrong he reckon without the strength of the international support that would rally to ukraine ’s cause i be proud that over the course of the past day britain have be at the forefront of that global response our effort always a step ahead of our ally have make a genuine difference from the outset we declassify intelligence specifically to scupper russian false flag our nlaw anti tank missile provide in advance of the full scale invasion and our javelins help brave ukrainians devastate putin ’s menacing mile armoured convoy which be head directly at kyiv we be the to send main battle tank with our challenger squadron plus armoured vehicle and anti armour weapon 
 all of this help to degrade russia ’s once formidable fighting force with putin loss amount to main battle tank armoured vehicle and artillery piece throughout this conflict our round of small arm ammunition have allow ukraine to maintain a rate of fire and recently help keep the russians at bay during their winter offensive meanwhile the kremlin have be unable to achieve the air superiority that it assume it would have in part thank to our donation of air defence missile and over british drone have be send to date 
 this conflict have indeed demonstrate that drone be change the face of modern warfare and we be already learn the lesson from that that be why early today my hon friend the minister for defence   procurement launch the uk defence drone strategy to stay ahead on this new frontier of technology back by at least £ announce by the prime minister recently make the uk the big drone partner for ukraine 
 yet it be actually at sea where the ally contribution to ukraine ’s cause have be most keenly feel our mighty storm shadows and our uncrewed sea system have help ukraine achieve a breakthrough in the black sea not only have russia ’s fleet lose different surface ship plus a submarine but a black sea corridor have open up for trade allow ukraine to export tonne of cargo include tonne of agricultural produce at the end of last month ukrainian agricultural export from its black sea port reach the high level since the war begin far exceed what happen under putin ’s black sea grain initiative 
 as president zelensky say to i when i visit the uk ’s contribution have be monumental he point out that since the start of the conflict the uk have send almost different type of capability to ukraine together we have show that when ukraine get what it need it can win which be why the uk be continue to step up our support last month the prime minister announce that we will be invest a furth £ in military support for ukraine take our total military package so far to over £ and our total support to over £ account for humanitarian and economic support as well 
 in that spirit today i can announce a new package of brimstone anti tank missile in a further boost to defend ukraine these missile have previously have significant impact on the battlefield in instance force russian force to abandon and to retreat from an attempt crossing of a river member will recall that a few day ago president zelensky tell the munich security conference that an artificial deficit of weapon will only help russia and he be right 
 so today we be give ukraine more of the help it need inflate its capability so that it can defend freedom ’s frontline other capability will also be come its way our uk found and administer international fund for ukraine have pledge more than £ to help ukraine plug gap in its capability deliver cutting edge drone along with electronic warfare and mine clearance capability with million of pound of kit to come 
 we be invest not just in weapon but in the brave personnel who serve so far britain have put more than ukrainians through their pace here in the uk but operation interflex our main training effort be go to expand even far i be delighted to announce that kosovo and estonia have join we australia canada denmark new zealand norway the netherlands sweden finland lithuania and romania in all train ukrainian troop here in britain together we will train a further in the half of 
 meanwhile we be build capability coalition alongside norway we be lead a maritime capability coalition and we have be join by a dozen other country in this enterprise this be about mine detection drone raid craft and sea king helicopter which have already be send its way so that ukraine can build its navy and defend its sovereign water 
 last week i meet my nato counterpart in brussels and i announce that together with latvia we would lead the drone coalition that will allow we to scale up and streamline the west ’s provision of miniature person view fpv drone to ukraine while support the establishment of a drone school for ukrainian operator and a test range as well as develop ai swarm drone technology which will surely be critical in the next phase of this war britain have earmark some £ to procure and produce long range strike and sea drone and become ukraine ’s large supplier of drone 
 yet this be far from the summit of our ambition in december we set up a new taskforce to build a strong defence industrial partnership with ukraine ensure that ukraine can sustain the fight for year to come in january the prime minister sign the historic security co operation agreement this be the start of a year alliance that we be build with our ukrainian friend once again it be the united kingdom that have sign the such agreement with welcome signing from france and germany have follow 
 the ukrainians have the will and they have the skill and they have show that if they be give the tool they can do the job but their need today remain particularly urgent russia be continue to attack along almost the entire frontline only recently decimate and then capture the eastern town of avdiivka the kremlin continue to callously strike at civilian target most recently hit a hospital in selydove putin be make no secret whatsoever of be in this for the long term russia ’s economy have indeed shift on to a full time war footing spend some of its federal expenditure on its defence a nominal increase of almost just on last year alone 
 if the cruel death of the remarkable brave russian opposition leader alexei navalny have teach we anything it be that putin ’s victory be something that none of we can afford the tyrant of the kremlin be determine simply to wait out the west he believe that we lack the stomach for the fight and we must show he that we be wrong this house may not be unite on all matter as we have see in the past hour but we be unite on thing our support for ukraine so the uk will continue to double down on that support and all freedom love country must be compel to do the same this year will be make or break for ukraine so it be time for the west and all civilised nation to step up and give ukraine the backing it need 
 year ago when i speak to an anxious oleksandr kubrakov who have retreat to that field outside kyiv he do not know what would happen to ukraine now enter the year of this conflict it be remarkable to see that ukrainians remain in full fight i know that the whole house will join i in say that the uk will not stop support the brave ukrainians our friend until they have win and have victory 
 i do not entirely agree with the right hon member ’s characterisation of the uk response in term of deindustrialisation i do agree that it be difficult overall to suddenly ramp up from whatever level we be produce at on a non war footing but it be hearten to know i think this be right but it be off the top of my head i will correct the figure if i have get it wrong that our munition and missile production be now time the level it be before the war so we have certainly step up 
 in addition we be carry out round of procurement through the international fund for ukraine which we establish and which be still receive new contribution i be delighted that australia have just donate $ to that fund i think again this be off the top of my head there have be round of contract procurement so far i be not familiar with the particular case that the right hon member cite so i will write back to he on the detail but it be encouraging that we have be able to set up a mechanism so that other country that have not have our scale of ambition and footprint on ukraine can put in their own money so that we can buy in coalition on their behalf we will continue to do that

 p002857 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the bbc board on the implementation of recommendation in the bbc mid term review 
 the bbc be a hugely value institution and the mid term review seek to ensure that it continue to provide an outstanding service by improve its process in relation to both impartiality and complaint i regularly meet the bbc ’s chair and director general and i will continue to use those meeting to raise these important issue 
 i start my career as a bbc reporter and i firmly believe in the importance of our national broadcaster be both independent particularly at moment and era such as this and completely impartial however every year many people complain that the bbc be not as impartial as it should be even that it be bias and the bbc then dismiss the vast majority of those complaint do my right hon and learn friend think that the public would perhaps have more confidence in how those complaint be investigate if they be investigate independently from the outset 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the public rightly expect the bbc to be an exemplar of impartiality our review highlight issue in relation to both impartiality and complaint as a result the bbc will undertake significant reform on both impartiality and complaint at the charter review as i have already say we will examine whether the bbc process remain the right complaint model 
 my innate lack of deference have probably not get i far in this place over the past year but it be good to see you in your rightful place this morning mr speaker 
 the bbc be a great british institution as the secretary of state say in consider the mid term review will she reflect on the importance in this era of fake news   biased comment and social medium of have a space in which information and news be present impartially and in accordance with editorial guideline the bbc be criticise from the left and the right which probably reflect the fact that it generally get thing right 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that the bbc play a critical role it be extremely trust not only here but across the world the bbc be an important institution which be why it be so important that it remain impartial i know that the director general agree and like i think there be more to do that be why in the mid term review we set out thing that the bbc continue to need to look at the bbc agree with our mid term review and have accept all our recommendation 
 what progress her department have make on introduce a national registration system for short term let 
 what progress her department have make on introduce a national registration system for short term let 
 what progress her department have make on introduce a national registration system for short term let 
 the government have deliver the legal framework for a registration scheme for short term let in england under the levelling up and regeneration act and have consult on the scheme ’s design on monday we announce that we will implement a national mandatory registration scheme across all of england we will set out further detail later this year on how the register will operate 
 i thank the minister for her answer and i thank the secretary of state for her engagement on this issue both now and in her previous role as housing minister it be great news that there will be a mandatory short term let register which will hopefully begin to relieve some of the pressure on our local housing market how can we ensure that north devon ’s tourist economy fully benefit from these change 
 my hon friend be a real champion for her local devon tourist economy and she be aware of the challenge that tourism can present in local community especially when it come to short term let which can make it too expensive for people work in the tourism industry to live near their job this be a difficult issue and we be try to strike the right balance between people be able to have home and ensure that hotel have a level playing field and that the local community have the right accommodation 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s campaign on this issue the next phase of the project will work with the sector to get the detail of the registration scheme right we will be reach out to representative of the visitor economy and likely user of the scheme to make sure it deliver for everybody as simply as possible 
 north norfolk have a significant number of holiday let airbnbs and the like i be glad that the minister say the government will look at this in moderation because in life too much of anything be sometimes a bad thing there be a difference a nuance between a person who rent out a room in their home via airbnb to earn some extra income and whole street and area be turn into holiday let can the minister assure i that we will properly consider the nuance 
 i can provide my hon friend with that assurance we be aware that the proliferation of short term let have cause real concern in community such as his we do not want to clamp down in a way that will make life difficult for people who rent out their room on a very irregular basis but as he say when whole street be cause a problem we think the most important thing be that we get an understanding of the scale of the problem our scheme be design to give we that datum and the next step can be take after that 
 i call bob blackman not here 
 cambridge have long suffer from the antisocial behaviour problem associate with short term let and cambridge city council have long ask for action so i welcome this long overdue announcement will the minister say more about enforcement and the resource that be need for council to enforce so that we can actually deal with the antisocial behaviour problem that sadly too often come with short term let 
 i thank the hon member for raise the issue in cambridge city and i appreciate that in a city such as that that there will have be significant problem in this area he may be aware that this be a joint announcement with the department for levelling up housing and communities we be there to put the mandatory register together which give we the datum that local authority can use but it will be for dluhc to look at the some of the power that can be implement to deal with the antisocial behaviour problem that the hon gentleman cite 
 i thank the minister for those answer tourism and short term let be very important to my constituency and i understand the issue clearly there be benefit it be not all negative and it be important that the positive be mark up as well let i ask she a simple question now that we have a reactivated northern ireland assembly on the go and work hard—[interruption.]—will she share some of her idea on this issue with it and in particular with the council in my strangford constituency 
 i thank the hon member for his question but unfortunately on the point of substance somebody cough and i slightly miss the key point i apologise i think he ask about share expertise with northern ireland we will be happy to do so because it be important to learn the lesson of how these issue be be address across the country in labour run wales there be a real mess over how to deal with the issue of holiday accommodation and the situation be similar in scotland we want to learn those lesson for the english scheme and we will be happy to share the lesson with northern ireland 
 what progress her department have make on respond to the consultation on the gambling white paper 
 the government launch consultation follow the gambling white paper we be consider all the evidence that be receive and will publish the government response soon our response to the consultation on the introduction of the online slot limit be due to be publish imminently and we be on track for implementation of the recommendation by the summer 
 will the minister ensure that the highly regulate land base industry can well innovate and grow by for example ensure that the right option be choose on the change propose to machine rule for the adult gaming sector which be out for consultation 
 the hon lady be right that the rule for the land base sector have be very out of date for some time that be why do these consultation have be really helpful it have identify further work that need to be do we have have a consultation on some of that but again we will still be on course to implement the change by the summer 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the unregulated black market for gambling cause untold devastation to people ’s life even when they be try to quit so what be the government do to protect family from the illegal black market in gambling 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the danger of the black market that be why as part of the white paper we say that we would give more power to the gambling commission to be able to close down those black market website which frankly be really quite dangerous 
 if she will meet promoter of the bid to the cultural development fund to restore the gala bingo hall in kettering 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s interest in the cultural development fund as the application process for its round be live unfortunately minister be unable to meet bid promoter at present 
 remarkably talented and enthusiastic individual from kettering beccy hurrell and lindsey atkins have put together a really ambitious £ bid to repurpose the former gala bingo hall in kettering high street change it into a community art music and family hub which will be transformative for kettering   town centre expression of interest in the department ’s cultural development fund must be submit by   march be there no way that i beccy lindsey and the council can meet the relevant minister before   march   to see whether our bid might be appropriate 
 i congratulate the woman who be put forward such an exciting and interesting bid for that important building on kettering high street in prepare to answer my hon friend ’s question i look at a potted history of kettering ’s bingo hall and i appreciate the important role it have to play in regenerate the town i speak to my noble friend lord parkinson as his ministerial brief cover this topic he be happy to meet and look into the issue but there be a question about the appropriate timing for that meeting i note the recent debate about level up i hope the bid will be successful but i be afraid i can not influence that 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of the closure of leisure centre on the community in north shropshire constituency 
 leisure centre provide important community hub connect individual within area in which they live and help to deliver important social and mental health outcome in recognition of this and of public leisure we have provide £ to swimming pool across england 
 whitchurch swimming pool in my constituency close in march thankfully there will be spade in the ground to reopen it in the come year but the council announce last week that swimming pool and leisure centre be at the top of its list for significant budget cut in the come year give the lack of public transport i be concerned that young people will not be able to learn to swim and the wide community will lose access to the healthy lifestyle that leisure centre offer will the minister meet i to discuss how we ensure people in such a stretch out rural area will be able to access leisure centre go forward 
 we provide that funding for swimming pool precisely because we recognise the particular challenge they face give high energy bill more broadly we be provide over £ of support for facility up and down the country include rural area that will help we to get more people active which be a key strand of our get active sport strategy 
 would my right hon friend the minister be willing to meet i to discuss the challenge face by leisure centre in local authority area face budgetary pressure such as shropshire he mention the swimming pool fund but there might be other opportunity to sustain these vital resource for local people include those in shropshire 
 it sound as if i need to have a cross shropshire meeting to discuss facility in that area we have be clear about the funding provide for   swimming pool as part of our strategy and determination to get more people active we will be do a piece of work to understand the location of black spot where we need to do more to provide more facility and what those facility should be to address local need 
 what step her department be take to help support charity with increase in the cost of living 
 the government have invest million of pound to support charity across england with the cost of living pressure include the £ community organisation cost of live fund which have now award all funding to frontline service help vulnerable household 
 charity across my constituency in blaydon do an amazing job in support people and community in what be really difficult time today a triple threat of rise cost fall income and high demand have create what the national council for voluntary organisations have call a cost of give crisis with half of all charity say they be at full capacity and some have to turn people away what further step can the government take to ensure charity can continue with their vital work 
 have be a head of fundraising for a charity i recognise the position charity face when donation fall at the minute they need to help more people that be why we have provide £ in funding and add another £ from dormant asset to help charity in that difficult situation 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on monday it be a privilege to speak at the launch of the state of the sector report which find that charity be prop up government service by £ a year will the minister tell i why the government expect the charitable sector to pick up the tab for government responsibility in the place 
 clearly the hon lady do not understand the charity sector if that be the position she be take have work in it for year i will not be lecture on this for example i find that the hospice i work in be able to respond to the need of family in a much well and more holistic way than the state sector could i be proud of the contribution that charity make to this country and long may that continue 
 what discussion she have have with representative of the creative industry on the impact of ai on that sector 
 i recognise the enormous potential of ai but also its risk i have have extensive engagement with the creative sector on these issue include a   series of roundtable talk on ai with among other medium music and film representative i be now work closely with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology on a programme of further engagement with the sector 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer but creator across the creative industry be concerned about ai developer some of whom be worth as much as $ use their work without consent and without compensation the inability of the government ’s work group to agree a code of practice on ai and intellectual property fuel concern that the status quo be work only for the developer this will be a grow problem if a voluntary code be not go to be possible how will the government and her department in particular ensure that creator will be pay fairly when their work be exploit 
 i understand this issue and the concern that my hon friend have mention i know that as chair of the culture media and sport committee she understand and appreciate these matter i want to assure she that the conclusion of the initial public offering working group be absolutely not the end of our work to find an appropriate regulatory solution for ai we be absolutely committed to ensure that ai development support rather than undermine human creativity for example we will be focus on ensure great transparency from ai developer and that ai output be properly attribute it be also right as she highlight that creator should be compensate for their work 
 good morning mr speaker ai firm be commit large scale abuse of copyright material use copyright image and piece of medium to train their ai tool without consent or compensation for copyright owner the united kingdom government say that they want to reduce barrier to ai company but that can only come at the expense of creator and artist how do it make sense to sacrifice the of uk gdp that come from the creative sector in favour of less than a quarter of a per cent of gdp that ai produce 
 i recognise the point that the hon member make in relation to the importance of protect creative right the creative ingenuity that be such an important part of both our british culture and economic value that be why i be hear from the sector and why in the government ’s ai white paper we recognise the importance of ensure great transparency from ai developer we be continue to work on that across government 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be sorry but the government ’s answer to the chair of the culture media and sport committee be a load of hot air that could have be write by chatgpt except chatgpt would have do a well job of it the truth of the matter be that the government ’s flagship on ai as it relate to creative industry which be mean to be protect the moral and economic right of artist musician and author while at the same time recognise the important advance that ai can bring have sink   last june the secretary of state say that if the code of practice be not achieve legislation could be consider so in the word of paul simon when be she go to make a new plan stan 
 i would just point out that the labour party have say absolutely nothing in relation to what it would do so to stand up here and say that we have no plan be absolutely unacceptable i can be absolutely clear that we do have a plan we have work very hard with the sector we have already set out in our white paper the step that we be take on a very important aspect in relation to transparency i will continue to work with the sector on all these area to ensure that this extremely complex matter come to a satisfactory conclusion for the creative industry 
 for what reason charity lottery have annual sale limit 
 if she will take step to remove annual sale limit on charity lottery 
 the limit for society lottery allow they to raise funding for charity but to remain distinct from other form of gambling and from the national lottery the limit be last increase recently in but i be aware that some operator want to see the limit raise or remove entirely it be important that any decision that be make be base on strong evidence as such i have commission research in this area which i hope we will review by the end of the year 
 the people ’s postcode lottery fund some brilliant organisation across batley and spen include the fantastic rainbow baby bank in heckmondwike and the game changerz youth provision in birstall however the current sale limit prevent the people ’s postcode lottery from give away even more grant to worthy community organisation across the country in all our constituency will the minister therefore explain why casino and bookie for example do not face a sale limit but charity lottery which be low risk and fund so many valuable local charity face that barrier 
 as i say at the reception that the people ’s postcode lottery hold the other night it be my privilege to set up a society lottery when i work in a hospice i recognise the value of such lottery to charity and i be aware of the issue that the ppl have raise i have work with the gambling commission to suggest way that it can grow under the current network as it be the large brand in the sector but as i say i want to see more research we need to understand what the potential harm be and what the potential effect be on the national lottery there be not enough datum at the moment that be why i be commission independent research so that we can make decision base on evidence 
 clearly in my vast and far fling constituency it be difficult for charity to raise money as member can imagine to date some £ in   community grant have be award to those charity that be very welcome indeed the minister mention that consideration will be give to raise limit or perhaps abolish they altogether may i make an impassioned plea that the particular circumstance of remote part of the uk be consider when the decision be make 
 i recognise the vast contribution that these lottery make to charity particularly those that work in rural area of course we will make sure that we take evidence on all those issue i be sure the hon gentleman would agree that we want to make sure that we be develop policy base on evidence but that do not detract from our recognition of the enormous work that these lottery do and we be incredibly grateful to they 
 what recent progress she have make on implement her department ’s multi sport grassroots facility programme 
 the government have commit over £ to multi sport grassroots site across the whole of the uk this be part of our mission to ensure that every community have the pitch and facility it need so far site have be support that include funding for grass pitch maintenance at waveney football club in my hon friend ’s constituency create many more opportunity for people of all background to get active 
 the development of multi sport grassroots facility be very often lead by sport which then face a variety of obstacle in get other sport authority to participate in a particular project what step be my right hon and learn friend take to remove those barrier and to promote collaboration between different sport authority so that much need facility can be build 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s question because it allow i to champion the fact that as a requirement of the government ’s investment in grassroots facility of project need to clearly benefit a sport other than football such as cricket rugby basketball or netball in england the football foundation and sport england work closely with the national governing body of other sport to encourage the development of multi sport project to promote collaboration between club at a local level 
 over girl lose interest in sport when they become teenager mainly due to lack of confidence and feeling judged but we know how beneficial sport be for mental health and there be many other benefit how have the department include gender in the implementation of the multi sport grassroots facility programme 
 i welcome that question we have a national sport strategy to get people more active that be focus on try to get those who be currently inactive into sport as the hon lady rightly mention woman and girl be less active in sport than   boy and man so we be focus in particular on that with a national taskforce that bring together all relevant departments and national govern body to ensure that we get more woman and girl involve in sport across the board 
 do the secretary of state accept that grassroots sport can play a hugely important part in level up as part of darwen ’s £ town deal we have invest in our football club our cricket club and our skate park and we be about to open a brand new a side pitch will she talk with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to see what part her department can play in ensure that sport play its proper part in enrich the cultural life of people in area with levelling up bid 
 my right hon friend be a huge champion for his area and for the north in general he be absolutely right that sport drama creativity all those thing level up an area i be very happy to talk to my right hon friend in the levelling up department to consider how we can continue across government to support the north 
 i have recently visit sport club in honiton include youth rugby gymnastic and football they be all seek support from the local authority east devon district council on the basis of its sport pitch strategy the government ’s multi sport grassroots facility programme be very welcome but do the secretary of state consider it generous enough for youth sport give that the co benefit of sport for young people include a sense of camaraderie good health and civic pride 
 our strategy be help sport across the board but i recognise in particular the importance of get young people involve in sport we have invest around £ in sport for young people include £ for multi sport pitch and £ in school so that more child get the required hour of physical education we be also invest across the board in youth service to get more young child active in constructive activity rather than in less appropriate one 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be proud of our government ’s record in support the creative industry figure publish last week which i be sure opposition members will welcome show that our powerhouse creative industry grow by in generate an enormous £ for uk plc put we ahead of our ambition to grow those sector by an extra £ by of course much of that depend on the amazing talent of britain many in the creative industry be benefit from the government ’s target tax break which be power those industry 
 do the secretary of state agree that we need to support local initiative to encourage more girl to get into or back into and remain in sport   i myself enjoy a long and prosperous rugby career playing in national league will she join i in congratulate somerton rugby football club on its new girl rugby skill and social night 
 more girl should have the opportunity to play sport that be traditionally the preserve of the boy that be why we be encourage all school to offer all sport to all their pupil whatever their gender in addition we be back woman ’s football with £ for pitch across the country to which girl will have priority access it be absolutely right that we continue to encourage girl and woman to take up more sport 
 gainsborough be once the capital of england under the incomparable sweyn forkbeard it be an historic market town with the old hall at its heart what plan do the government have to preserve the character of historic market town such as gainsborough 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise the beauty and heritage of gainsborough heritage of course have a vital role to play in level up and can act as a powerful catalyst to increase opportunity and prosperity we recognise the opportunity that historic high street give we and we have a £ high street heritage action zone programme that be drive the regeneration of of our town and city i believe that gainsborough have previously be a recipient of heritage lottery programme and we also have a scheme to help with historic church 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 coverage of yesterday ’s commons chaos show how desperately we need good quality journalism so i be concern about bbc scotland ’s request to ofcom for a reduction in its broadcast news output especially the loss of the bbc scotland ’s tv news have something of a couthie image until the come along place scottish news in the context of uk and international news it be a compromise offering for those who want a scottish on bbc although the create a pathway for young talent i say at the time that its slot tuck away on a channel that many struggle to find could be its undoing and now it have be pull in an election year we need more scrutiny of politician not less and the need for a properly resource scottish remain i hope ofcom will say no to the proposal and i know that the cabinet secretary for culture angus robertson oppose the reduction in news output do the minister 
 i be aware that the bbc be look at change its programme mix in relation to news in scotland my understanding be that those change be cost neutral but i hear what the hon gentleman say and appreciate that he have concern about they he will be aware that we do not hold direct power over the bbc ’s programming mix i be sure that the director general have hear his concern as i say i think the bbc be still invest in quality news content in scotland but it may be that the mix be change and the hon gentleman be clearly unhappy about that 
 cheadle town fc have be a member of the north west counties football league since however the oversubscribed division leave cheadle town and other south manchester club at risk of be move laterally into a midland division mean a significant increase in the club ’s travel cost and an impact on gate break their identity as a northern club and challenge their future viability i have meet the football association and raise the club ’s concern will my right hon and learn friend join i in urge the fa to review its process and listen to south manchester club that want to keep their team northern 
 my hon friend be a massive champion for her area she have previously raise this issue with i and with the sport minister as she rightly recognise level to of the english football league system be administer by the fa and decision regard which league a team play in at those level be for the fa in its role as govern body i be sure the fa be listen to my hon friend ’s concern and will have hear her plea this morning 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this week in the house i raise with the economic secretary to the treasury the fact that serious delay in his majesty ’s revenue and customs issue a1 form mean that tour musician be wait month to be pay a1 form ensure that musician do not have to pay additional tax when tour in the eu but some musician be wait to month or even a year for those form lead singer tell i that musician feel like hostage of hmrc incompetence so what be the secretary of state do alongside treasury ministers to sort out this mess which be hit uk musician so hard 
 i recognise the importance of tour to many of our fantastic industry we have bilateral agreement with many other country to ensure that touring can take place but i will continue to ensure that as a government we take every step across the board to make sure that our musician can tour appropriately 
 what assessment have the minister make of the bbc ’s proposal to launch new national music radio station and to relaunch an exist station radio sports extra to my mind those proposal be a direct imitation of commercial broadcaster innovation and the time and resource that the bbc be invest could be well spend in reverse the cut to bbc local radio a source of distinctive public service content that be not available anywhere else on the same medium 
 my hon friend be a stalwart of the radio scene i would like to pay tribute to the year career of steve wright another stalwart of bbc radio i have speak to the director general about the launch of new radio service and he be very aware of the strength of feeling in this house about the proposal for local radio the mid term review say that the bbc should engage much more closely with the market ahead of the launch of any new station but ofcom also have power to make a judgment on these matter before any new station be launch 
 now that the government have move to repeal section of the crime and courts act there remain no legislative measure to convince print medium to sign up to the state regulator so how do the government plan to finally give the state regulator the power to do its job as call for by the national union of journalists 
 i be very proud that we have a free press and i think it be really important that we repeal section to ensure there be not a chilling effect on our reporting of course since that be propose we have have great self regulation and i be sure the press will continue to ensure that they do their outstanding job in an appropriate fashion 
 can we recognise pickleball as a national sport and will the sport minister come to the dunstable hunters pickleball club where he will see man woman grandparent and grandchild have a wonderful time

 on the annual sale limit on the people ’s postcode lottery the minister say that he want to have some evidence on why an additional increase be necessary since the advent of the pandemic funding and fundraising have come under increase pressure and that have lead to charity in my constituency closing saje scotland a domestic violence charity be unable to access funding so the evidence of the need be there for everyone to see will he at least consider an additional uplift to the annual sale limit in the interim so that charity can access meaningful funding and be not force to close down because of a lack thereof 
 i think it be important to put it on record that almost every other society lottery be nowhere near those limit but i do recognise that it may be get tight for some of the individual trust in the people ’s postcode lottery we have be speak to the gambling commission to see what else it can do by use some of the other trust at its disposal to increase that funding but i take on board the point the hon member make

 i be sorry to learn of the experience in my hon friend ’s constituency and i can tell he that he be completely right about the importance of keep church open for those who want to come the good news be that keep church open increase footfall and that deter criminal lock up church be a poor deterrent to thief i can also tell he that funding for roof alarm be provide by the diocese of oxford back in when there be a spate of theft from church roof in his area i encourage church in his constituency to contact the diocese again to see whether that might be make available 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer thus far he will recall that i have previously ask at church commissioners question about theft from church in my constituency and neighbouring constituency st john ’s and st andrew ’s at st andrew ’s the theft take place during the mass which be outrageous to put it mildly in my view the church commissioners be not listen to the police ’s advice and support what need to happen be for church to get at least the same support and assistance from the police as other place of worship will he use his good office to go back to the church of england and ensure dialogue between the police and the church to protect our church as place of worship 
 i be sorry to learn of my hon friend ’s concern i will certainly feed that straight back to the hierarchy of the church and ensure that those meeting happen however i be pleased to tell he that follow his question to i on this issue last month the police have arrest a suspect for a series of church burglary in barnet brent and harrow and he be remand in custody i have be tell that the metropolitan police be in close contact with the diocese of london and local church but there clearly need to be more dialogue i will ensure that that happen 
 i recently have the pleasure of visit the holy trinity church at dunkeswell which sit on the site of the cistercian   dunkeswell abbey in my constituency visit it be a move spiritual experience give that some site such as that be in rural remote area where there will simply never be the footfall that the hon member describe can he assure we that we can continue to keep they open in spite of any threat of theft 
 i completely understand the hon gentleman ’s point like he i be a lover of our rural church i suggest that he point the churchwarden and the priest to the comprehensive advice on the church of england website and perhaps have further conversation with the diocese and local police if there be still issue i ask he to come back to i about that 
 i thank the church estates commissioner for that answer we live in an age where modern technology be available as a method of address these issue but be incredibly expensive what fund be issue to we in northern ireland through barnett consequential to ensure that church can adequately secure building with security camera and cctv if there be currently no funding could that be consider when we take into account the rural and isolated status of so many church building 
 i be sorry to tell the hon gentleman that as far as i be aware this area be not cover by barnett consequential again i direct he to the advice on the church of england website which can be see by church in northern ireland if there be particular issue i be happy to have a quiet conversation with he in the tea room to see how we can share good practice to try to help his church 
 if the church will have discussion with the secretary of state for the home department on the church ’s guidance for clergy on support asylum seeker 
 whether the church provide training for clergy on support asylum seeker wish to convert to christianity 
 what guidance the church issue for clergy on support asylum seeker wish to convert to christianity 
 both archbishop have offer to meet the home secretary and the church have provide advice and guidance for clergy to consider when deal with request for baptism from asylum seeker the guidance refer to the need for discernment and recognise that there may be mixed motif on the part of asylum seeker request baptism 
 i welcome that meeting those who be genuinely seek to convert to christianity should of course be allow to do so but be my hon friend aware that there be grow concern in this country that the church of england naively at good and deliberately at bad be be see to aid and abet asylum seeker in get around the law of this country and remain in the united kingdom may i urge the church of   england to update its guidance entitle support asylum seekers guidance for church of england clergy as soon as possible to ensure that it be in alignment with new legislation pass in this house 
 that guidance be be update so i can reassure my hon friend on that point he be right that clergy will always rightly tell everyone they come across about the love of jesus but clergy do not determine asylum claim of course priest be expect to uphold the law and make truthful representation of character i hope that reassure he i also note that in the recent times investigation of case hear by the upper tribunal where a claimant cite conversion to christianity as a reason to be grant asylum only be approve be dismiss and new hearing be order in other case 
 my hon friend will have hear the comment make by my hon friend   the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   at prime minister ’s question the problem be this bring the church of england into disrepute it imply that some vicar be naive foolish and innocent it be important for the credibility of the church of england that training be more robust and that well mean folk do not endanger our society 
 i hear very clearly what my hon friend say i know that he like i take seriously the reputation of the church of england he care a great deal about it and i be grateful to he for that i repeat the answer i give my hon friend   the member for kettering mr hollobone priest be require to use discernment to recognise that there might be mixed motif and always to put forward truthful representation of character 
 i hear the word of my hon friend   the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   as well when there be plenty wrong and plenty to complain about it be not always the case that we should blame the establish church be it 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend any institution run by human will never be perfect but he be right that the church of england be unfairly accuse of be involve in some case when it have no involvement at all

 the right hon gentleman take these issue very seriously and have a long involvement with the church of england start with the issue the church commission professor jay ’s report the church get the seriousness of these issue and it will consider very seriously how to respond the archbishop have describe her report as a vital next step we be not in denial and we will put thing right the right hon gentleman also know very well how the general synod of the church of england work it be a sovereign body it meet again this weekend reconcile different viewpoint so that we can walk together be not easy but we be committed to that i know that his word will have be hear and note by member of the general synod in advance of its debate

 the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners be ask 
 what step the church be take to support anglican church in country list in the world watch list 
 through the sister church of our communion and our link missionary society the church of england    continue to provide both prayerful support and practical assistance to all part of the anglican communion where freedom of religion or belief be threaten or impair the church work with our government other government around the world and multilateral body such as the united nations to advocate forcefully for freedom of religion or belief 
 follow the implementation of much of the groundbreaking truro review the uk be now see as a global leader on religious freedom however sadly persecution be exponentially increase across the world so we need to embed that work do my hon friend agree that like government religious leader need to commit to strategic thinking structural change and the provision of additional resource if together we be to effectively tackle this global scourge 
 indeed i do on embed that work it be good news that my hon friend ’s international freedom of religion or belief bill have a successful reading in this house on   january and that it go to committee in april i be glad that the bill be strongly support by the foreign secretary and that the bishop of winchester have offer to take it forward in the other place of course he be the person who write the original report however my hon friend ’s challenge be fair as our government step up on this global challenge the church of england and the anglican communion need to as well i will pass her remark back to lambeth palace 
 that complete the question but i would like to answer sir charles the security of all member really matter it be take very seriously in this house work be ongoing and i be have serious conversation about what we do go forward i can tell you that we have some of the good people work on it and i would like to thank they for what they do 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make a statement on financial redress for sub postmaster and outstanding issue relate to the post office horizon scandal 
 as a back bencher i speak on the matter of compensation for victim in march which be obviously long after the right hon gentleman campaign for it i pay tribute to his campaigning on this subject which remain undiminished my appetite for compensation for postmaster be equally undiminishe although i accept the need to increase the pace of delivery 
 as of this month £ have be pay in financial redress to more than victim affect by the horizon scandal more than of eligible full claim receive have be settle as follow conviction have be overturn and full claim have be submit of which have be settle application to the horizon shortfall scheme have be receive and have be settle full claim have be submit to the group litigation order scheme and have be settle 
 our top priority remain ensure that victim can access swift and fair compensation we have introduce optional fix sum award of £ for victim with overturn conviction and of £ for group litigation order member as a swift mean of settlement and of original applicant to the horizon shortfall scheme have receive offer of compensation today we be discuss what other measure can be take to speed up compensation with the horizon compensation advisory board on which the right hon gentleman sit 
 since the prime minister ’s announcement on   january official in the department for business and trade and the ministry of justice have be work at pace to progress legislation for overturn conviction relate to the post office ’s prosecutorial behaviour and horizon evidence i will provide a further update to the house very soon 
 thank you mr speaker for grant the urgent question i draw the attention of the house to my interest as a member of the horizon compensation advisory board 
 i like the minister he campaign on this issue before he be a minister and he have be a very good minister but a lot of that good work be undo on monday by the performance of the secretary of state for business and trade i be disappointed that he have not take the opportunity today to talk about the overturned conviction i understand that later today at o’clock there will be a write ministerial statement on the subject i do not think that be the way to do it as the house need an opportunity to discuss the overturned conviction 
 i will ask the minister a few question it be quite clear now that nick read the post office chief executive write to the lord chancellor basically oppose the overturning of all conviction say that up to people be guilty it be not yet clear who instruct he to do that on monday the secretary of state say it be do off his own bat i would like to hear what the minister have to say on that 
 if there be to be overturn conviction they can not just be about horizon they should also be about capture evidence that i have put to the public inquiry and send to the minister yesterday clearly indicate that the scandal predate horizon those affect need to be include in both the compensation scheme and among those with overturned conviction 
 the board be meet this afternoon and we have make recommendation to the minister on how to simplify and speed up the compensation scheme will he give an assurance to the house that once the recommendation be agree we can announce they quite quickly primarily to restore to the sub postmaster some faith which be wreck by the performance of the secretary of state on monday 
 if the minister ’s write ministerial statement at o’clock be about overturn conviction will he give a commitment to come back to the house on monday to give an oral statement so that the house can interrogate he and discuss that issue 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question the overturned conviction be a key priority for i and my department i be always keen to update the house whenever i can there always have to be a sequence to ensure that we follow proper process what we be do potentially affect the devolved administration so it be really important that we engage with they properly that be of the reason why we need to make the write statement later today i have never be unwilling to come before the house and report on what we be do i will of course continue to do that 
 on the letter from the chief executive to the justice secretary i be aware of the allegation by mr staunton they be very serious allegation that should not be make lightly or be base on a vague recollection if the right hon gentleman look at the letter from the former permanent secretary it be clear that she believe the allegation be incorrect and that there be never any conversation along the line refer to by mr staunton i think it be pretty clear that those allegation be false 
 the right hon gentleman have regularly bring up capture we be keen to continue to engage with he on that to ensure that those affect be include in any compensation where detriment have occur i note his point about an oral statement as i say i be always keen to give such statement whenever possible and to be interrogate on our plan i do not think he will be disappoint by what we announce later today 
 now that the then permanent secretary have outline that she do not implicitly or explicitly tell the then chairman of the post office to slow down compensation i hope we can spend time less time talk about someone who have lose his job and more time talk about postmaster who have lose everything will the minister who be do great work in sort this out recommit to august as his target date for get compensation life change compensation out of the door as soon as possible 
 i thank my hon friend for his work on this matter as my predecessor he do a tremendous job the most concern allegation we hear over the   weekend be about the delay in the payment of compensation in her letter which be publicly available the permanent secretary write 
 it be not true that i make any instruction either explicitly or implicitly in fact no mention of delay compensation appear in either note 
 so i agree with my hon friend that we should move on from that and focus on what really matter which be get what he rightly describe as life change compensation to postmaster as quickly as possible that be his and will remain our no priority 
 i call the shadow minister 
 let i pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for north durham mr jones   for secure the urgent question and indeed for all the work he have do over many year along with other member in try to secure justice for sub postmaster 
 the post office horizon scandal be of the most insidious injustice in our country ’s history it have rob innocent people of their livelihood their liberty and all too sadly their life at least sub postmaster have die without see justice or receive compensation and at least have take their own life more than year on the victim and their family be still suffer from the consequence and the trauma of all that they have be put through they have be trap in a nightmare for too long we all want to see the exoneration of all who remain convict and the delivery of rightful compensation to all affected sub postmaster as quickly as possible labour want to see a swift and comprehensive solution to this insidious injustice and we be willing to work with the government to ensure that happen 
 will the minister please provide an update on the timeline to which he be work to amend the seismic damage that this scandal have cause and will he please give an assurance that he be act with the appropriate speed that be require for necessary legislation to go through victim have already wait too long for justice and we must act now with the speed and urgency that this awful scandal require 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the way in which he have approach this matter there be nothing in his remark that i disagree with as i say early of claimant have receive full and final compensation but we fully share his wish and that of his party for a swift resolution and a swift end to this and we have engage significantly and extensively with his colleague on the front bench as for how we overturn conviction the measure that we be take be clearly unprecedented but this be an unprecedented situation 
 the hon gentleman ask about the timeline we have always say that it be week but it be few week now than it be i do not think he will be disappoint i say this to the right hon member for north durham as well by what we will say hopefully later today but this have take too long we be work daily to resolve these issue and the overturning of conviction the legislation and the compensation can not come too quickly 
 my hon friend have do a great job but i be conscious that there be still many people wait to settle much of   that be due to the fact that the post office be not release information that have be request by my constituent or indeed their solicitor i hope that my hon friend can put across to the chief executive of the post office how critical it be to regain trust by release that information because i fear that other sub postmaster or people who might otherwise have be interested in deal with the post office will start either to move away or not to take up those business opportunity which would also damage community and that be already happen in my constituency 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question and for make that point she be absolutely right disclosure both to the inquiry and on individual case which be require to be able to compile claim have be too slow if post office ltd and its management team be go to rebuild trust with claimant and the wide public it be absolutely incumbent on they that this be do properly and that the governance around it be do properly that be part of the reason why the secretary of state act as decisively as she do but i absolutely concur with my right hon friend alongside she i urge post office ltd to deliver disclosure more quickly 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 document publish this week by the bbc reveal that the swift review date february note that post office ltd have always know about the balance transaction capability that allow transaction to be addende remotely which be what happen the lawyer for post office ltd do nothing about that and many people still do not trust it a letter have be circulate and   the right hon member for north durham mr jones   deserve all the praise we can give he today i have a copy of his memo which say that anyone can write to he on any issue and get advice on how to pursue claim 
 the minister have give we a list of percentage and so on but it be still not fast enough it be still not good enough and of the reason be that post office ltd be still not trust people want nothing to do with it i can not fix that but i do not think that the spat between the secretary of state and henry staunton this week do anything to increase sub postmaster confidence and we really need to get this sort yes the horizon shortfall scheme have be well manage in some regard and claim be go through and be pay but how much be be pay so many sub postmaster be get derisory offer not just people in the glo scheme but normal everyday sub postmaster who have be put in money for year we need to get this sort i appeal to all sub postmaster affect to put in a claim 
 i entirely agree with the hon lady on that point and on a number of other point she raise and i thank she again for the work she have do in this area for many year i too be concerned about some of the information that come to light this week and the public inquiry be there to examine any allegation relate to who know what and when it would be wrong of we to duplicate the inquiry ’s effort because it be a public inquiry that have the power to summon witness to give evidence and to carry out other form of evidence gathering which be the right way to do this   i agree with the hon lady that compensation can not come fast enough and that post office ltd have to rebuild trust not just with the wide public key to this be the postmaster 
 yes of course we want to make sure that people get fair compensation may i point gently to the performance so far of the group litigation order scheme full claim have be receive offer have be make and have be accept without go to the next level which be the independent panel that tend to indicate that those offer be fair because people have recourse to the appeal process i be aware of or high profile case where people say they have not be offer a fair amount i can not talk about individual case but we urge any of those individual to go to the next stage of the process which be the independent panel the whole scheme be oversee by sir ross cranston who have a very good reputation both in this house and far afield we absolutely believe that the process will offer fair compensation but we urge people to return to the table and ensure that their claim be properly consider by all mean available 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work he have do on this issue not only on the front bench but on the back benches no amount of compensation can compensate the victim of this complete scandal however it do help and speed up the process be obviously important will he during the passage of the legislation that the government have promise to introduce ensure that innocent victim be not only compensate but completely exonerated in their community they have suffer the stigma attach to all this and they need to have their name clear and their reputation restore 
 i thank my hon friend for his regular contribution on this subject which he frequently raise prior to the itv series i appreciate his work 
 my hon friend be right to say that no amount of compensation can make up for what happen to many people ’s life we want all the innocent people to be exonerate we know there be nervousness with some victim not trust the process they have simply have enough we meet howe co. of the solicitor to talk about this issue yesterday and its contention be that around of the people who receive a letter say we will not oppose an appeal still will not come forward we need a process that do not require people to come forward if we be to have a mass exoneration of those affect by this horrendous scandal we hope to announce that later today 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 i associate myself with the word of praise for the minister ’s speed and attention on this issue i think a legally bind instruction for the post office and the department to deliver at speed be a necessity in the new bill the minister have tell we today that about £ have be pay in compensation but there be provision for about £ which mean that only of the money have be pay   out he update the house on the number of claimant and there be people in the glo group and who be convict as the minister tell we only people have have their final compensation fully pay which be only of the group 
 the confusion at the beginning of the week about who say what to whom show there be confusion about the instruction to deliver at speed when the bill come before we will the minister reflect on the necessity for a legally bind deadline under which the post office must make information available in to day and an offer must be make to settle within to day with a legally bind deadline for final resolution otherwise frankly i worry that the ambiguity will still cause delay he know as well as i do that justice delay be justice deny 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for pay regular attention to this issue i know that the committee have a session next week and will be ask some of those question 
 we be keen to get compensation to victim as soon as possible we be somewhat at the mercy of claim and we can not offer compensation if claim do not come in like other i be very keen for people to come forward to submit a claim of the reason why we put forward the fix sum award of £ for overturn conviction and £ for member of the glo scheme be to try to accelerate the payment of compensation which contradict the claim that people be try to slow thing down 
 i be meet the horizon compensation advisory board this afternoon to look at its recommendation for accelerate compensation we have take nothing off the table and i remind the right hon gentleman that the house recently vote to extend the compensation deadline from   august on the recommendation of sir wyn williams because we do not want people to be time out of compensation the maximum budget for compensation have thus far be set at £ 
 of the issue we be try to resolve urgently be the fact that people be reluctant to come forward to have their conviction overturn by the court of appeal which be of the reason why we have not compensate enough people with conviction we can not compensate they until we overturn their conviction which be exactly why we have propose the legislation once we have do that the door will be open for compensation to flow freely that be exactly what the right hon gentleman and i want to see 
 there have never be any confusion in our mind about the need to deliver this quickly i have focus on that every single day both since i have be in office and before i have never be resist by anyone in my department or in other part of government there may be confusion but i promise that there have be no confusion in government 
 i add my thank to the minister for his work in help i to advise my constituent who have come forward ask many question about the situation that they find themselves in i be very pleased that the government be work to compensate postmaster who be convict in a court of law but there be many individual who work for the post office and face disciplinary   proceeding who do not end up in court however their professional reputation be trash they have no ability to find job when they be dismiss and they be significantly out of pocket the post office must know whom it discipline it must have record through the disciplinary procedure will the minister outline what step the post office have take to contact those individual so that they can get the compensation that they rightly deserve 
 i thank my hon friend for so ably represent his constituent who have fall victim to this scandal people do not need to have go before a court of law to be compensate a postmaster with a contract with the post office can access either the horizon shortfall scheme or the glo a prosecution of any form be not require to be able to claim through those scheme i think he raise a point about somebody who work for a postmaster or for the post office that be separate and i be very happy to talk to he about that point which have be raise by a number of member the post office would not necessarily know whether a postmaster who be work independently and run an independent business have discipline their member of staff so it might not be as straightforward as he set out nevertheless i be happy to engage with he on that 
 the problem for many sub postmaster and sub postmistress be the quantification of what they be due to be repay under the shortfall scheme because payment be make out of their own pocket on several occasion over a long period it be difficult in those circumstance for the claimant to know that they have be properly compensate because the post office can not tell they how much it should be repay to take a step back be it not apparent that we can not continue to leave the post office to mark its own homework and that the independent element of scrutiny need to be strengthen somebody independent of government and the post office must be put in charge of not just sort this out but do so at speed 
 i agree with the right hon member ’s point and he be right that quantification be very difficult these situation be complex it be about not just financial loss but the personal impact include the impact on mental health physical health reputation all those thing in those situation we should give the claimant the benefit of the doubt where this can not be evidence in many case the record be no long available 
 we have independent people in all part of the process member of the horizon shortfall scheme include eminent kc such as lord garnier from the other place we have sir ross cranston oversee the glo scheme and in the overturned conviction scheme we have sir gary hickinbottom they be eminent retired high court judge i have great faith in their hold our foot to the fire and get the right quantum of compensation to the right people at the right time indeed the horizon compensation advisory board with   the right hon member for north durham mr jones   and lord arbuthnot be also hold our foot to the fire make sure that we do the right thing and deliver the right amount of compensation i will meet it again later today 
 i know that the minister mean well and that he also understand that my affected constituent have have enough of be tell that the government be work hard to get they the justice they deserve and promise of swift compensation of my constituent ’s claim be submit in october she hear the minister say in january that all claim would have offer within day but she still have not have an offer she be right to conclude that the allegation of delay payment to benefit the treasury be true be she not 
 i be sorry that the hon member have take that tone but that be not true as i set out i think henry staunton have get this completely wrong it be not the case and there have never be any situation while i have be in this role my predecessor have say the same where we have try to delay compensation if the hon member want to write to i i be very happy to look at an individual case our commitment on the glo scheme be that once we have receive a full claim we will respond to of case within day some case be more complex but i be very happy to look at her specific case as i have for other member when people have contact we directly i be very keen to make sure that we get a resolution to her constituent ’s case as quickly as possible 
 i congratulate the minister on his tenacity in relation to this issue when do he expect the inquiry to be complete it seem that fujitsu be hide behind that inquiry and be unwilling to commit itself to compensate the taxpayer for the compensation the taxpayer will be pay
