the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 the legacy act be reject by our domestic court as well as by victim and survivor across northern ireland not least because it propose give immunity from prosecution for the most appalling terrorist crime any incoming government would have have to fix this mess and that be what this government be seek to do with the northern ireland troubles bill which we publish yesterday 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer and for his remark in yesterday ’s statement about the professionalism bravery and sacrifice of our armed force and veteran include those who live in my constituency of basingstoke in their role in northern ireland across the uk and abroad what discussion have he have with veteran the defence secretary and the minister for veterans and people on the new provision and protection in the new legislation 
 i have have many such discussion as i indicate in my statement to the house yesterday and those have inform the package of veteran protection contain in the bill which the government have set out 
 when the unlawful legacy act shut down investigation into the death of british soldier people across the country include in my constituency will have think that be desperately unfair and not just on those individual but on the family and victim can the secretary of state assure i and my constituent that under the new legacy act there will be opportunity for those victim finally to get the justice they deserve 
 there certainly will because with the commission as it be now and with the commission as it will be reform by the trouble bill any incident relate to the trouble anywhere in the united kingdom can be refer into the commission the m62 coach bombing the kingsmill massacre and the warrenpoint massacre be all currently the subject of investigation by the commission 
 many family be desperate for answer about what happen to their love one that be often not about want to take legal action they just want to know under this new bill how quickly will that be deliver for those family how quickly will they get the information that they have wait decade to receive 
 i know from my discussion with the commission that it be work hard with the or so case that it be already deal with to go through that process and start produce report for family we know that many family have decide not to engage with the commission because they object to the legacy act and in particular to the immunity it be propose to give that be why we be remove that i encourage more family to come forward because i know that the commission and its staff be determined to try to provide the answer that those family seek 
 the secretary of state ’s allegation about the legacy act rest on a fiction that the labour government have not already hand out amnesty to all those terrorist killer fact need to be put in front of the house be from the good friday agreement which 
 put in place mechanism to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoner convict of scheduled offence 
 that be half of the amnesty the other half be the comfort letter and the right place to look there be the judge ’s ruling in the downey case which shoot down any future prosecution the judge say i will read it carefully that there be a 
 public interest in hold official of the state to promise they have make in full understanding of what be involve in the bargain hence i have conclude that this be of those rare case in which in the particular circumstance it offend the court ’s sense of justice and propriety to be ask to try the defendant 
 in other word it be an amnesty whether the government like it or not 
 on the issue that the right hon gentleman raise for anyone who be serve a sentence for a trouble relate offence part of the good friday agreement be that they be release after year the people of northern ireland vote for that by about it be part of the agreement on his point there be specific issue in the case of mr downey because he have be give a letter that say he be not want when in fact he be that be why that prosecution could not proceed the right hon gentleman ’s point be undermine by the fact that mr downey this be a matter of public record be currently face prosecution for count of murder in it therefore can not be the case that any letter he receive give he an amnesty 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 a number of the core provision of the previous government ’s legacy act have be deem by the northern ireland court to be incompatible with our human right obligation do the secretary of state agree that it be little wonder that the legislation be so widely opposed and do this not make the task of repeal and replace it even more important 
 it certainly do make it more important because it be a piece of legislation that have not work and do not command support in northern ireland if legislation be pass in this house that do not command support in northern ireland how on earth can we expect the answer that family be seek which   the right hon member for skipton and ripon sir julian smith   refer to a moment ago to be provide we have a responsibility to give more people in northern ireland confidence in the new arrangement so that they will come forward to get the answer they have be seek 
 the secretary of state have do much to talk up the alleged special provision in relation to ex servicemen but legally be it not the case that any such provision would have to apply across the board if i be wrong about that will the secretary of state now tell the house which special provision apply exclusively and only to servicemen 
 the provision that apply exclusively and only to service personnel be the arrangement to prevent cold calling a protocol will be agree with the commission in relation to that and secondly not be require to rehearse the history when the ministry of defence would be perfectly capable of provide that information the hon and learn gentleman be a distinguished lawyer will know that in respect to other arrangement for witness the law require that they be available to all witness 
 many family have be struggle and campaign for year for truth and justice and they be now hopeful that we can get to the truth we know that mi5 admit only a few month ago that it have not give all of the file over to operation kenova i be also aware that there be many northern ireland office and mod file that have not yet go through the freedom of information process and be therefore not available to the national archives will the secretary of state commit today to ensure that those file be available to the new legacy commission 
 the legacy commission have the right to receive all information that it require to do its job we be propose in the legislation to amend the arrangement for disclosure to require the secretary of state to conduct a balance exercise which be not in the previous act and to require the secretary of state to give reason in line with standard that apply across the uk in addition any decision of the secretary of state be open to be judicially review those be important change that i hope will give people in northern ireland great confidence 
 the secretary of state say yesterday that his new legacy commission will not relitigate previous investigation involve veteran unless there be compelling reason to do so that be reinforce in clause of the bill that have now be publish to remove scope from opportunistic lawyer would he consider define far more closely than he have do up to this point precisely what he mean by compelling reason 
 that be no doubt an issue that the house will discuss as the bill be consider in detail i think that compelling and essential be a pretty high bar it will be for the commission to interpret that but no doubt we will continue to discuss it 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 far to the secretary of state ’s comment on the adequacy of the legacy and reconciliation act i would like to turn to the role of the european convention on human right as he will be aware the leader of the opposition seem more interested in the view of the member for mar a lago and moscow than the vision of her predecessor winston churchill and be now call for withdrawal from the echr may i therefore ask the secretary of state what assessment his department have make as to the effect that cease to be a signatory of the convention would have on the good friday agreement the windsor protocol the new legacy framework and northern ireland ’s institution in general 
 the government be absolutely committed to the european convention on human right i very much regret that the current opposition have move away from that historic support which go right back to winston churchill as the hon member have set out it be highly irresponsible to suggest pick away at of the essential foundation of the good friday agreement 
 yesterday in an atypical fit of pique the secretary of state fail to answer my question as to whether the attorney general lord hermer have be exclude from the legislation or have personally recuse himself so today i have an easy question give that the secretary of state yesterday highlight the protection for veteran in this legislation could he tell the house which page which clause or which line use the word veteran 
 the clause that would implement the protection in relation to veteran and other be clause and 
 hear hear 
 labour members may cheer but not of those clause refer to veteran those be not protection for veteran they be protection for everyone paragraph of the explanatory note show that what i be say be true and many of they be already available in the criminal justice system it be a mirage 
 to be collegiate the secretary of state have spend many year criticise the legacy act of and previous effort on the basis that they command no political support whatsoever across the party of northern ireland   if there be agreement across northern ireland ’s members of parliament on amendment during the passage of his legislation will he agree to those amendment 
 the right hon gentleman invite i to speculate on amendment that i have not yet see as i indicate to the house yesterday i want to work in as collegiate a way as possible in try to take the legislation through in respect to the part of his question however i would say that the only reason the protection and clause i just read out be in the bill be because of the government ’s determination to treat our veteran fairly 
 what step he be take to ensure that intertrade uk operate independently and transparently 
 as part of safeguard the union intertrade uk be establish to advise on and promote trade and investment across the uk the term of reference and work programme be publish on gov.uk the nio provide secretariat support but intertrade uk be free to submit advice and recommendation to the government as it see fit 
 what indicator be the secretary of state use to measure growth in trade within the uk internal market will he commit to publicise an independent assessment of the barrier that the northern ireland protocol be have on trade within the uk and northern ireland which i believe affect the ability of intertrade uk to fully promote trade within the uk and operate independently 
 as the hon gentleman will be aware a range of organisation include intertrade uk be look at the impact of the windsor framework we have recently have lord murphy ’s report for example which the government be commit to publish the house of lords northern ireland affairs committee publish a report on the same subject only this morning 
 do the secretary of state agree that of the major deterrent to investment and growth in northern ireland be the absence month after the restoration of stormont of a publish investment strategy from the executive with any sort of a road map for investor or business on the infrastructure road and housing development that the executive will invest in do he agree that in the absence of that strategy we be fly blind in investment term have he have any discussion with the executive about that 
 like my hon friend i look forward to see the investment strategy publish northern ireland have a great opportunity under the windsor framework because of the dual market access which no other part of the united kingdom have for those look to invest to trade with both the uk and the european union there be no well place to come and do that but northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the defence industrial strategy on northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the defence industrial strategy on northern ireland 
 in this role i be committed to support all people across northern ireland from its business to its community group there be much to champion i will do all that i can to build on the excellent work of my predecessor my hon friend   the member for putney fleur anderson 
 the defence industrial strategy be great news for northern ireland we be commit to economic growth that people can feel in their pocket and the £ allocate to defence growth deal include in northern ireland will see its booming defence sector thrive 
 airbus which manufacture satellite in my stevenage constituency will soon integrate the civil aircraft wing business at the historical shorts site in belfast close to where thales test its satellite and produce vital missile for ukraine will the minister work with colleague across government and the northern ireland executive to ensure that the defence industrial strategy be complement by the industrial strategy ’s advanced manufacturing sector plan so as to maximise skill innovation and growth 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the rich expertise in northern ireland ’s defence sector which bring benefit right across the uk include to stevenage i assure he that the secretary of state and i will work across government and with the executive to ensure a join up approach that benefit northern ireland 
 i be incredibly proud of our naval engineering history in the black country include at company such as somers forge in halesowen and brooks forgings in cradley heath i be delighted that this labour government be increase defence spending to level never see under the previous government do the minister agree that that investment in northern ireland at place such as harland wolff will not just benefit the local economy there but the supply chain all across the country 
 my hon friend be right i warmly welcome this investment and i know he be rightly proud of the defence expertise in his constituency back by this labour government increase defence spending to harland wolff be build the next generation of support ship for our royal navy we be safeguard job skill and our future security 
 i welcome both the minister to his place and the defence growth deal do he agree that he now need to work with the northern ireland executive to ensure that the   supply chain in northern ireland extend beyond harland wolff and the great belfast area so that everyone in northern ireland can benefit from what be potentially a life change development for industry there 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his warm word he be right that we need to work across northern ireland to ensure that the life change investment he mention be feel throughout and i will make sure that happen 
 may i welcome the minister to his place as well will he ensure that there be that co work across the northern ireland executive and the ministry of defence with regard to the executive ’s investment strategy which be also integral to the defence industrial strategy and that the nie will work to remove any blockage that would prevent the be merge 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his warm word i will meet executive ministers in northern ireland next week to discuss this and other matter i will ensure that we remove any blockage that we can and that we do so by work together 
 what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 the government be commit to repeal and replace the legacy act with new arrangement that seek to command great confidence in northern ireland yesterday we publish the northern ireland troubles bill and a draft remedial order to do just that 
 yesterday the secretary of state announce this labour government ’s new northern ireland troubles bill despite all the justification for the bill it still mean thing veteran many of whom be elderly be drag back through the court do the secretary of state think that be an acceptable way to treat those people who bravely serve and defend our country 
 the hon gentleman say drag back to court the only circumstance in which a veteran or anyone else appear in court be if they be charge with an offence he will know perfectly well what the figure show about prosecution in the year since the good friday agreement here we be talk about coroner inquest a small number will be restart because they be already in train and be stop by the last legacy act the rest will go into the sifting process govern by the solicitor general we think   that we have a fair and reasonable framework that we will put in place to ensure that veteran be protect and properly look after 
 on   september the prime minister assure the bbc that veteran would receive protection not afford to paramilitary so can the secretary of state confirm which of the statutory protection will apply solely to veteran or be it the case that they will also extend to paramilitary 
 i will give the hon gentleman example which involve the representation of veteran on the statutory advisory group that will be establish draw on the experience of operation kenova allow the voice of veteran to be hear this will be cover by clause of the legislation 
 of the concern around drag veteran through lawfare and our court be the effect on army recruitment so what be the secretary of state ’s reaction to colonel nick kitson the son of general sir frank kitson say 
 how can anyone volunteer to put their life on the line for a government indeed a nation that do not have their back 
 i meet many cadet who be very keen to join the armed force and we should pay tribute to all who be offer their service to the nation in defence of the realm we should not talk down the importance of that recruitment effort if anybody look in the round at what we be put forward they will think it be reasonable i have meet many veteran who argue as the veterans commissioners have say that they be not look for immunity under the law which be what the legacy act give they be look for fairness under it and that be what we will provide 
 do my right hon friend agree that people who join the british army not only recognise that they have to abide by the law but expect the government to have their back and offer they that fairness can he offer an assurance that people who serve in northern ireland will be give the fairness that they expect and that this be a government that genuinely have their back 
 i be happy to give my hon friend that assurance to take another example of the protection it be put to we by veteran in our discussion that no veteran should have to return to northern ireland to engage with legacy process and we be legislate for that in the bill 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this morning unusually i congratulate the government on have admit a terrible mistake early this year we on this side of the house vote against labour ’s draft remedial order which would have allow gerry adams to sue the taxpayer so we welcome the fact that labour amend that order yesterday but the question remain why do it ever bring forward such a ridiculous policy in the place 
 i hope that the hon gentleman will not only offer congratulation but continue these discussion about legacy matter in that spirit when i say i be prepared to listen i mean it i would just point out to he that the problem arise because of the supreme court judgment as he be well aware and that for just over year the last government could not find a solution the that be put in place do not work because it be find to be incompatible i have reflect on the point that be make in representation and this decision will ensure that there be no gap as it have be refer to we have find a mechanism that we believe will achieve what section and fail to do 
 i invite the secretary of state to look at his own legislation because clause and be markedly similar to the section that we leave he we on this side of the house may have win the battle over this but we still have not win the war to protect our veteran from vexatious complaint be it not the truth that if it have not be for month of campaigning by the conservatives the shadow defence team the medium and report from policy exchange which may now have save the taxpayer hundred of million of pound labour would have stick to its plan and allow mr adams and his comrade to sue anyway 
 i indicate to the house some month ago that we be determined to find a mean of deal with the supreme court judgment in on the subject of the carltona principle that be what our propose legislation will seek to remedy we think it be a well formulation than section and and i look forward to the hon gentleman ’s support in pass it 
 what step he be take to maintain northern ireland ’s place in the uk internal market 
 the government be commit to safeguard northern ireland ’s place in the uk internal market and to implement the windsor framework in good faith the internal market scheme enable trader to move good from great britain into northern ireland tariff free and since may with significantly reduce paperwork and check 
 it be a disgrace that the safeguard the union provision severely restrict trade between great britain and northern ireland bind the province to area of eu law over which the people have no say will the secretary of state take step to remove what be leave of this damaging international trade border within our own nation and restore the birthright of the people of northern ireland as equal citizen of this united kingdom 
 i say to the hon gentleman and those who advocate that we should leave the european union this be the consequence of it there be an open border and different jurisdiction how be we go to deal with trade in those circumstance secondly the good be flow the good be move look at   the evidence the northern ireland economy in the quarter grow by that be not indicative of a problem 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on   november   last year the health secretary assure this house that the tobacco and vapes bill will apply in northern ireland the secretary of state will know that the age base sale ban affect the placement of tobacco product on the market and so be potentially in breach of the eu ’s tobacco product directive so can the secretary of state repeat the health secretary ’s assurance and also tell we whether the government have confirm with the european union that the ban will stand in northern ireland 
 it be certainly the government ’s intention that the ban will apply in northern ireland because it be very important that young people all over the united kingdom be protect in the way in which the bill seek 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i welcome to the gallery the honourable speaker of the parliament of the republic of fiji and the chairman of the parliament of ukraine 
 member will also know that today mark the anniversary of the death of our friend and colleague sir david amess who be murder in his southend west constituency in sir david be a long serve member of parliament respect and like by member across the house and dedicate to his constituency we remember he fondly 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october 
 as you have just say mr speaker today mark year since the horrific murder of sir david amess sir david be much love across the house kind and generous and i know it be a huge loss to many member opposite may he rest in peace 
 as we remember sir david and our friend jo cox of course i want to take this opportunity to condemn unequivocally the death threat make against   the hon member for clacton nigel farage i know the whole house will welcome the justice that have be do whatever our disagreement we be all parliamentarian and i will not stand for violence or threat against our democracy 
 mr speaker on that point may i update the house on the china spy case i be deeply disappointed by the outcome we want to see prosecution mr speaker i know just how seriously rightly that you take these matter national security will always be the priority of this government and we will always defend against espionage in recent week baseless accusation have be put about by the party opposite let i set out the fact the relevant period be when these offence take place that be under the conservative government between the year of and that period be bookende by the integrated review of the beginning of the period and the refresh of that review in set out their policy these statement of government policy be very carefully word to not describe china as an enemy instead—[interruption 
 mr stuart somebody who be on the speaker ’s panel and who i have tell once before should know well do not question my judgment i think it be important that the prime minister tell the house rather than somewhere else please this be very important to i and to the house i take it seriously so i do not need any more side comment 
 the review of and the refresh of be very carefully word to not describe china as an enemy instead they state that they would increase national security protection where china pose a threat and that the then government would engage with china to leave room open for constructive and predictable relation 
 the deputy national security adviser matt collins set out the then government ’s position in a substantive witness statement in which be subsequently supplement by further short statement the cabinet secretary assure i that the dnsa faithfully set out the policy of the then tory government i know at hand that the dnsa be a civil servant of the utmost integrity and those opposition members who work with he i be sure would agree with that assessment 
 under this government no minister or special adviser play any role in the provision of evidence i can not say what the position be of the previous government in relation to the involvement of ministers or special adviser if the leader of the opposition know the answer to that question and i suspect that she do i invite she to update the house 
 last night the crown prosecution service clarify that in its view the decision whether to publish the witness statement of the dnsa be for the government i therefore carefully consider this question this morning and after legal advice i have decide to publish the witness statement give the information contain we will conduct a short process but i want to make it clear that i intend to publish the witness statement in full 
 to be clear have the conservatives be quick in update our legislation a review that start in these individual could have be prosecute and we would not be where we be now i be happy to answer any question on this 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 last week i visit rayner a world lead provider of cataract solution base in worthing a winner of this year ’s king ’s award for enterprise for innovation and a fantastic employer of local apprentice i welcome the government ’s ambition to get third of our young people into an apprenticeship further education or university what will the prime minister do to ensure that every young person in east worthing and shoreham have the skill they need to thrive 
 we want a country where young people be support where the quality of teaching be raise and where every skilled apprentice be value and respect we have set a new target of third of young people to be in an apprenticeship or university that will smash the glass ceiling and renew our country we have support this with a record £ budget for more apprenticeship more technical college and guarantee training apprenticeship or work for all to year old 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 mr speaker thank you for mark year since the terrible murder of sir david amess i know the whole house will want to join i in remember our former colleague he be very much still in our heart and mind the way he die remind we that the security of members and this parliament be paramount so it concern we all that the case against people spy on member of this house have collapse it be simply unbelievable 
 exactly as i expect the prime minister have to be drag out at the top of pmq to give a statement that answer no question laughter i do not know what they be laugh at we be talk about the security of this parliament he have to be drag out only to repeat more obfuscation it be simply unbelievable that he be try to say that the last government do not classify china as a threat so i will refresh his memory 
 in the previous government ’s integrate review describe china as 
 the big state base threat to the uk ’s economic security 
 in the then minister for security say from the dispatch box that china pose a threat but let we leave aside the government in november the director general of mi5 classify china as a threat in his remark how be it possible that the government fail to provide the evidence that the cps need to prosecute 
 the substantive evidence be provide in by the previous government that be when the witness statement be submit i be go to disclose it member will all be able to read it the substantive evidence be write disclose and submit in under the previous government i note that the leader of the opposition do not indicate whether ministers be involve in that at the time 
 the leader of the opposition question what be in the refresh review of and let i be clear the then foreign secretary   the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly who be sit on the opposition front bench give a speech at mansion house month after the arrest it be call our   position on china and set out the government ’s policy he say in that speech that sum up china as a threat in word would be 
 impossible impractical and most importantly unwise 
 he be foreign secretary at the time 
 it be not just the right hon member for braintree the leader of the opposition be business secretary at the time in september the relevant year she say 
 we certainly should not be describe china as a foe 
 it be worth look up the word foe in the dictionary it do not end there in september she say 
 i have shy away from call china a threat 
 she be play politic with national security 
 the prime minister can read the beginning of a quote but let i finish that quote at the end of the quote that he just read out i do describe china as a threat but his whataboutery neglect the fact that the spy be charge under a conservative government and let off under labour 
 the prime minister have not answer any question on monday the security minister repeatedly tell the house that ministers do not take decision and that it be the deputy national security adviser who have full freedom be the government seriously say that only man the deputy national security adviser have anything to do with this failure be that prime minister seriously say that the deputy do not discuss with the national security adviser the home secretary or anyone in downing street be the prime minister seriously say that 
 yes and let i explain why the case be charge under the last government accord to the evidence submit under that government who set out their policy position what be on issue in the trial be not the position of the current government but the position of the last government they carefully avoid describe china as an enemy because that be their policy at the time as far as the position under this government be concern no minister or special adviser be involve i will double check this—[interruption this be important after the charge decision the prosecution be very careful about who would then see the witness evidence i will double check exactly what instruction be take but i can be absolutely clear that no minister be involve no special adviser be involve in this i be as assure as i can be that the prosecution be say that it would be the witness only who would be involve in short update to the evidence that be submit under the previous government 
 the end of the answer be different from the beginning of the answer what on earth be the point of we have a lawyer rather than a leader as the prime minister if he can not even get the law right on a matter of national security he keep go back to the cps the cps have say that it be satisfied that it be right to charge in august the sunday times report that jonathan powell the prime minister ’s national security adviser convene a secret meeting to discuss the security consequence of the china spy trial do that meeting happen or be the sunday times make it up 
 the right hon lady be clearly not a lawyer or a leader the problem for she be that i do actually understand the law and i know what have to be prove i have also look at the evidence that be put in under the last government in relation to this case there be a meeting in september that do not involve the national security adviser discuss the evidence in any way further point the final statement in this case be submit in august there be no further submission of evidence way or the other after any discussion in september this be a red herring a completely scurrilous allegation make by the leader of the opposition 
 the prime minister have now twice directly contradict the word of his security minister they can not both be right the chair of the foreign affairs committee could not get any answer from the security minister the cps say that it be satisfied that the decision to charge the case in april not august be correct on the basis of where the law stand at that time this be a matter of fact not a matter of what the previous government have think or of the case not meet a legal test it do something must have change when the charge be bring and when the case collapse the charge be bring under the conservatives and collapse under labour will the prime minister tell we what change and what collapse the case 
 i have say that i will publish the witness statement in full the whole house will then see exactly what be set out in in the substantive witness statement and exactly what be set out in the supplementary witness statement the right hon lady will then realise that what she have just say be entirely baseless 
 the cps have say in the clear term that this prosecution be drop because this government do not provide the statement it expect why should we believe a man who at the last prime minister ’s question say that he have full confidence in the good friend of a convict paedophile forgive we if we do not trust a word he say this all stink of a cover up give his statement early will the prime minister publish today not just the government witness statement but also the meeting minute and all the correspondence that he have with the cps 
 let i be clear the only process i want to go through be in relation to some of the individual in the statement to make sure that they know that this be come up i can assure the house that there be no substantive delay here 
 rise 
 i know this be of acute concern to a number of people i will have the statement out in full there be a bit of proper process that i need to go through the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat   will understand why that be necessary and then they will be publish in full the right hon lady ask about minute etc there be the usual rule and process for government i remind she that the substantive issue in this case be discuss at meeting under the previous government so the opposition be ask i to disclose the discussion that they have in relation to the witness statement in the place 
 mr speaker you deserve well and this house deserve well than the evasive answer that we have have from the prime minister even the former cabinet secretary lord butler have accuse the government of be economical with the truth on this issue the prime minister can not tell we why jonathan powell have a secret meeting when the security minister say he have no involvement the case he can not tell we why his government do not provide evidence that china be a threat and i suspect that the statement will not prove that either he be blame his civil servant the medium and the last government he can not explain why he could not see this case through he should have see this case through 
 let i be clear about what have happen a serious case involve national security have collapse because this government be too weak to stand up to china if the prime minister can not protect the member of this house what do that say about his ability to protect this country 
 the case do not proceed because the policy of the past government do not meet the test that be necessary that be the long and the short of it far from evade i have say that i will disclose the full witness statement and set out exactly what be in they and exactly what the subsequent statement say the allegation that somehow they be change that the and statement be different be completely and utterly unfounded this be a pathetic spectacle instead of take responsibility for the fact that they fail to update the law the review into the legislation be in the conservatives take year to change the law have they do that more quickly this case would have proceed it be their failure and they be just sling mud meanwhile we be get on with renew our country plan reform to get britain build again online hospital for waiting list and new opportunity for young people labour be build a well future the conservatives can not even come to term with their past 
 derby be a city on the up but unfortunately this last year we have be devastate by knife crime nasty tory austerity decimate frontline policing and we be now pay the price for that at my regular city centre safety summit the message be clear to turn the page we need action not word can the prime minister update my constituent on the action that this government be take to ensure that all our resident visitor and worker can enjoy our city centre safely 
 my hon friend will have hear at our conference from pooja kanda who i have meet a number of time her son ronan be fatally stab iusb be proud that we have deliver ronan ’s law to tackle the sale of ninja sword we have also ban zombie knife and strengthen control for online knife sale i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s work in set up the city safety summit 
 i call the deputy leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i associate myself and my party with the tribute to david amess on behalf of my party may i also pay tribute to ming   campbell who be be lay to rest today that be the reason why my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   can not be here i thank you mr speaker the prime minister and other member of this house for the very kind tribute pay yesterday 
 we welcome the new level of transparency from the prime minister and we will scrutinise the witness statement closely but it be clear that there be still many question to be answer include question from hongkonger hongkonger in st albans and across the uk settle in our community after they flee repression at the hand of the chinese state but they now see a british government who want to make it hard for they to settle here permanently refuse to impose targeted sanction on chinese official who put bounty on hongkongers head refuse to rule out a chinese super embassy and be fail to tackle chinese espionage hongkonger be start to ask whether the prime minister be trade away their security and safety in our community for a cosier relationship with beijing what be the prime minister ’s answer to they 
 the answer be no we have give and will continue to give support to hongkongers who need and deserve that support the hon lady will be assure that the jimmy lai case be raise regularly at every opportunity by my ministers and by i

 business confidence have fall for consecutive quarter and the royal institution of chartered surveyors have say that there be significant concern in the housing market the prime minister could inject some confidence back into the economy he could help work family to get on to the housing ladder and he could even simplify the tax affair of his cabinet if he adopt the policy advocate by the leader of the opposition of scrap stamp duty on residential property will he at least give a commitment not to raise property taxis in his nightmare before christmas budget 
 we will certainly not be follow the leader of the opposition she unveil what she call she golden economic rule i think it be which involve £ of spending cut that be a of the nhs budget with not a shred of detail about where the money would come from the institute for government say that it be base on shaky foundation more unfunded tax cut and more austerity for public service the conservatives have not listen and they have not learn

 my hon friend have be a strong advocate for his constituent on this issue the health secretary have meet the family affect by these failure twice i think this year to hear their story and i want to make it clear that what happen to their loved one be unacceptable the health secretary be currently consider the good way forward so that family get the answer that they deserve it be right that they receive any update but i can assure my hon friend that we will provide that update as soon as we be able to do so 
 later this afternoon i will be launch a small business survey so that the small and medium sized enterprise in my constituency which employ thousand of my constituent can have their say about what be like to run a business under a labour government and what their concern be ahead of the budget however i want to give the prime minister the opportunity to provide a word of hope that i can share will he tell my constituent that he have hear the plea of sme and their fright about the budget that he will scrap business rate for hospitality and leisure as well as the family business and family farm taxis and that his government will commit themselves to no further tax rise for business 
 just a few month ago we publish our small business strategy which be base on what small business say to we i will make a copy available to the hon lady so that she can give to each of her constituent before they respond to the survey 
 after   year of neglect this government be renew the infrastructure of britain and for the benefit of the leader of the opposition that be spell b r i t a i n. nowhere be this renewal more clearly need than at the a226 galley hill road in swanscombe in my constituency which collapse more than year ago and there be no fix in sight do the prime minister agree that the announcement of the transport structure fund in the spending review show that this government be end the conservative decline and get on with fix break road like galley hill 
 my hon friend be right the conservative party let road crumble after year of under investment we be build infrastructure that work people rely on with £ to repair bridge tunnel and flyover across the country and £ in major road and rail upgrade we be rebuild britain the conservatives can not even spell it 
 much like the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth my constituent be serve by the tees esk and wear valleys mental health trust they face travel to york or middlesbrough for local in patient bed with some people be send as far afield as glasgow or southampton this be completely unacceptable and we need a provision of local mental health in patient bed i welcome the openness to an inquiry into tewv but my concern be that while that be go on we need real action so that the continue failing do not see the loss of any other life what step will the prime minister and the secretary of state take now to reassure our constituent and to rebuild trust in tewv 
 the hon gentleman will have hear my response to my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth   a moment ago i say again that what happen to his constituent be unacceptable and we will give the answer as soon as we can in the meantime the hon member ask what be happen we be get on with recruit additional nhs mental health staff we be build new dedicated mental health emergency department and we have boost nhs spending on mental health by almost £ 
 i thank the prime minister for his strong word at our party conference in call for unity at a time when many feel that our country be divide and in rightly call out racism i be a generation immigrant bear in this country and people like i and so many of our constituent have every right to be here no should face hatred because of the colour of their skin do the prime minister agree that some of those on the opposition benches who seek to stoke division and keep close company with those who accept russian bribe can not and should not be trust to govern this country 
 my hon friend capture the choice before we as a country we can either give in to division or come together as a country and renew our country this be national hate crime awareness week and in the past fortnight we have see the horrific terror atrocity in manchester and a despicable arson attack on the mosque in peacehaven i want to be clear as prime minister i be proud to lead and to serve this beautiful tolerant and diverse country an attack on of we be an attack on all of we 
 calithea studios in mid dunbartonshire be a prime example of a business do everything the government ask the owner of this beauty salon and her employee each earn less than £ a year yet the business will pay the government over £ for the year in vat employer ’s national insurance and pension contribution do the prime minister think it be fair that the hard work owner who be provide job and training on the high street contribute more to the exchequer than she earn in a year do he believe this encourage entrepreneurship which be important for economic growth and local job 
 as the hon lady will know we have protect business rate bill from inflation and extended relief at with new permanent low rate set and introduce for retail hospitality and leisure as part of our small business plan we be provide £ so that lender can offer more loan to small business we be of course introduce the most significant package on late payment a real issue for small business and reform that be big than any in the last year 
 can the prime minister update the house on the government ’s election bill do he agree that in the light of recent court case and the conviction of reform ’s former leader in wales no party whose leader take russian bribe can be trust to defend our democracy 
 labour be introduce an election bill to protect our democracy from foreign interference but look at reform   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   and his deputy   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice work alongside someone who take money to spread putin ’s propaganda whatever their denial they have serious question to answer about what they know but that be the choice kremlin crony sow division or labour patriot work for national renewal 
 the line that we have hear from the government in recent day have be a conflation of fabricated story try to set up straw man and knock down thing that have not be say the real question in this whole debate be whether or not the director of public prosecutions charge legally and properly if they do then the official secrets act be valid and all this talk about the national security act which i introduce be completely irrelevant if they do not why be he not charge his successor with abuse of power well we know the reality mr speaker although the prime minister have answer the question   about evidence the real question be what political direction do this government give to their official before they go to give evidence 
 absolutely none absolutely none i will also tell the right hon gentleman this i be the chief prosecutor for year and i can say that in those year which include year under the coalition government when we be take difficult decision on mps expense not once not once be i subject to political pressure of any sort from anyone that be the tradition in this country it be a proud tradition and it be i uphold as prime minister just as i uphold it when i be director of public prosecutions 
 on a point of order mr speaker in the statement that the security minister make early this week and then again in answer to a question today i have be misquote and the misquote i think be significant it have be say that i in a speech at mansion house say that describe china as a threat be 
 impossible impractical and most importantly unwise 
 the quote be that describe china or our policy in word be 
 impossible impractical and most importantly unwise 
 in that speech i go on to say of our policy 
 we will strengthen our national security protection wherever beijing ’s action pose a threat to our people or our prosperity 
 i finish by say 
 and when there be tension with other objective we will always put our national security 
 how can i get redress for this misquote mr speaker 
 the right hon gentleman have put it on the record and it be there now for all to see i will leave it at that 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement on the adequacy of jhoots as a pharmacy provider 
 i congratulate the hon member on secure this important urgent question 
 pharmacy play a vital role in our healthcare system they be at the heart of our high street and be the cornerstone of community up and down the country that be why this government have give pharmacy a funding boost of almost £ this year which be more than any other area of the nhs and the big uplift in year indeed we have provide a uplift over the year period 
 the vast majority of pharmacy provide excellent care to their patient but unfortunately there be some that fall short of the standard we expect sadly the service provide by jhoot be fall well below the mark hon member will know that several integrate care board have be deploy contract management action against jhoot initially in the form of breach notice integrated care board enforce the nhs term of service on pharmacy for such thing as their opening hour and the general pharmaceutical council regulate pharmacy premise and pharmacy professional both icb and the general pharmaceutical council have power to address problem in pharmacy and they be actively use those power include in relation to store that be part of jhoot 
 i have write to the hon gentleman about this case as he will understand it be difficult for i to go into detail about pharmacy chain at least on the specific of the measure we be take but i can tell he that where there be problem with access to medicine icb be support affected patient in the short term for example by allow local dispense doctor to provide dispense service to those patient where pharmacy store regularly breach their term of service icb can give they notice that they be be remove from the pharmaceutical list this power apply to any and all pharmacy include of course jhoot and mean that pharmacy would no long be able to provide nhs service such notice can be appeal against so it do take some time to work through the system i stress to hon member that pharmacy be private business and must be responsible business owner we can regulate what pharmacy should and should not do as part of their nhs term of service but it be not possible to prevent pharmacy from for example not pay their staff 
 in conclusion if pharmacy breach their term of service for example by not be open when they should be or where there be patient safety concern we take action the general pharmaceutical council be take regulatory action icb be take regulatory action and be support patient with access to medicine where necessary this be aim at improve pharmacy behaviour but can ultimately lead to pharmacy be force to close their business i have also ask my official to explore whether we can strengthen the regulatory   framework to be able to deal more quickly with pharmacy that do not play by the rule my official be work on that as a matter of urgency my office be also set up a meeting with the hon gentleman to discuss this matter far and i will keep the house update in the usual way 
 i would be grateful madam deputy speaker if you could pass on my thank to mr speaker for grant this urgent question i thank the minister for his response 
 the collapse of service provision in some place the constant closure in other and the general governance at jhoots pharmacy which operate branch across england demand immediate ministerial intervention in west dorset jhoots branch in lyme regis and bridport have be close for month leave thousand without access to essential medication and place a huge strain on overstretch neighbouring pharmacy jhoot staff have go month without pay despite payslip be issue tax deduction make and pension contribution not deposit i have be contact only this morning by staff who have not be pay for the month many be unable to buy food or pay rent they be rely on food bank and the amazing community that have step up to support they there have be report of staff recruit by jhoot under skilled worker visa be leave without income or resource i have also be make aware of deeply troubling report of control drug be remove without proper documentation or process which if prove true may constitute a breach of the misuse of drugs act 
 i have raise my concern with the general pharmaceutical council his majesty ’s revenue and customs the nhs business services authority the icb and the minister whom i thank for his response i understand that process must be follow but this situation require immediate action jhoot staff be not be pay and people across the country do not have access to vital medicine will the minister please confirm what step be be take to ensure that all jhoots staff be pay without delay what discussion have take place with the nhs bsa the general pharmaceutical council and other regulator about jhoots ’s business practice finally will the government commit to urgently review jhoots ’s suitability as an nhs pharmacy provider outline what safeguard will be introduce to prevent this from happen again and review the pharmacy funding model 
 i agree with everything the hon gentleman have say it be completely and utterly unacceptable if a business such as jhoots be not pay its staff if there be indeed these report that control drug be not be handle properly i would strongly recommend that any mishandling of drug be report to the general pharmaceutical council which regulate pharmacy professional and premise so that appropriate action can be take 
 the hon gentleman ask about the payment of staff pharmacy staff be vital part of the nhs part of what a pharmacy do pharmacy staff provide vital service to our community and should be pay accord to their contract any failure to do so be completely unacceptable of course pharmacy staff be employ not by the nhs but by the business they work for so   any dispute between staff and a pharmacy business should be raise with the advisory conciliation and arbitration service acas i be also in touch with the pharmacists defence association the pda which be do important work represent its member i will be meet they soon as well of course we have responsibility for the nhs part of the work but it be up to individual business to ensure that their employee be treat fairly 
 the hon gentleman rightly mention the review of suitability to operate and we be now look at that across the board we be look at the role of the general pharmaceutical council and what be take place with icb take contract action where there be no sign of improvement and pharmacy continue to be in breach the next escalation be to strike they off the pharmaceutical register which take some time because certain pharmacy i be not go to name name but i be sure the hon gentleman can imagine who be try every single thing they can to appeal push back and stop the action that we be seek to take which be elongate the process however i want to be clear if there be clear breach and action be not take to remedy that breach pharmacy will be strike off the pharmaceutical register 
 i call our very own pharmacist sadik al hassan 
 thank you madam deputy speaker as a pharmacist for nearly year and the mp of north somerset i have the dubious pleasure of have jhoots pharmacy in the town of portishead in my constituency i can not say operating pharmacy because they have shutter their door with report of they not have pay their bill their rent or their staff as a pharmacist i know that this affect the perception and view of community pharmacy up and down the country what plan do the minister and the department have to ensure that bad actor in the pharmacy space as jhoot in my opinion appear to be be deal with more quickly and effectively under new legislation 
 order question should not be statement 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s direct professional expertise and experience as a pharmacist he be right to point to the fact that the regulatory framework be not as strong as it need to be i have speak with official in my department who have work in the pharmacy sector for many year and they have never see behaviour like this before it be quite unprecedented nevertheless it be shin a light on the fact that we do not have a strong enough regulatory framework we need to look at the way that business owner be regulate there be strong regulation of pharmacist and pharmacy staff such as technician but business owner be not regulate as strongly as they could and should be 
 my hon friend be right that speed be also important which be why we need to look at way of fast track particular case where there be clear breach because sometimes the appeal process can be very slow indeed we be look at all of this in the round and i have commission urgent advice from my official to see how we can beef up the regulatory framework 
 i call the shadow minister 
 only this weekend the national pharmacy association chief executive henry gregg say that he be concerned that 
 report of jhoots pharmacy branch across england fail patient risk damage community pharmacy ’s reputation and could imperil its ability to secure a good funding settlement 
 community across the country have be leave without function pharmacy door have be lock without notice patient have arrive to find no pharmacist no prescription and no stock and staff have go unpaid and be threaten with the sack jhoots pharmacy face allegation of not pay wage have premise repossess and serious regulatory breach the general pharmaceutical council have already intervene several time yet for many patient it be too late they simply can not get their medicine this be not an isolated business failure it expose a deep fragility in the community pharmacy network on which local people depend for basic and often lifesave care 
 i have question for the minister when be nhs england make aware of these closure and have the minister meet the jhoots leadership if not why not if he do what be the outcome secondly have the department assess how many people have be leave without local pharmacy access as a result of jhoots ’s action and what be the minister do to remedy this consider it be happen across the country he mention icb but there be several involve thirdly what mechanism exist to ensure continuity of care when a contractor collapse or walk away again he mention icb but be there a national contingency plan finally will the government now review whether the current model under which chain be expand rapidly through acquisition and debt be fit to safeguard community pharmacy in the long term link to that can the minister definitively confirm that the funding settlement have not be compromise 
 the year nhs plan state that it want to move more care into the community yet it be completely miss a delivery chapter on how to achieve that at the same time we have issue such as jhoots i hope the minister will be take step to investigate this issue in its entirety and to safeguard against this type of incident happen again and will spell out the delivery aspect of the year plan 
 i thank the shadow minister for his question he ask about awareness of what be happen with jhoot he will be aware that it enter the market through the purchase of a number of lloyds pharmacy that be no long a go concern in so the question about due diligence on jhoots as an operator be probably something he should be ask of my predecessor from his party which be in power at the time since those purchase jhoots have expand rapidly and that have be where we have see the question mark around its ability to operate and the serious downgrading of service 
 i have not meet the management of jhoots we be look at a whole range of legal and regulatory enforcement procedure and the decision we have take be that it be well not to interfere in any way in those   process but i be certainly monitor that very closely if we receive legal advice that suggest that such a meeting would be a good idea i will of course be open to it however the current legal position base on the advice we have receive be that it would not be appropriate at this time 
 on local pharmacy access integrate care board have a statutory responsibility to ensure adequate pharmacy provision some icb for example have allow dispense gp practice to provide dispense service to affected patient while other have work with local gp practice to advise patient to nominate alternative nearby pharmacy for their prescription we have look at the impact geographically and our view be that in most case there be alternative pharmacy provision to jhoots within striking distance however there be or area of the country where that be not the case include in the constituency of   the hon member for west dorset edward morello who secure this urgent question i be very conscious of that in those case extra provision need to be make through icb and gps that may be through distance selling or by other mean to ensure that patient have pharmacy access 
 the shadow minister ask about continuity of care and national contingency the situation be challenging because as i mention in my remark and as official have say we have not see this rapid decline in service before we be work at pace to strengthen the regulatory framework and we be look at contingency plan i do not see any reason why the overall funding settlement for pharmacy should be undermine we will continue to protect community pharmacy as a crucial part of our nhs 
 i thank the minister for his response community pharmacy such as lodge pharmacy in perry common in my area play a vital role and offer an excellent service and that be why i be concern when place such as jhoots pharmacy close or maybe fold the winter month be come and i be passionate about winter measure how will we ensure that our pharmacy can offer the winter vaccine need this year if we lose large chain such as jhoot 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s work on the select committee nhs england be assess the situation and prepare contingency plan in case jhoots become insolvent such plan involve work with other local pharmacy and dispense gp practice to ensure that patient continue to have access to medicine continuity of care as she rightly point out must be at the heart of our response and we be work at pace to ensure that be protect 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 may i thank my hon friend   the member for west dorset edward morello   for raise this appalling issue pharmacy be at the heart of our community and be rely upon by million they be under increase pressure across the country where we be see irregular opening hour and unannounced closure family live in community that rely on jhoots pharmacy such as   those in the constituency of my hon friend and many other part of the country will be deeply concerned that they and their loved one could be about to be leave without medicine that they desperately need staff have be place in an intolerable situation 
 the national pharmacy association ’s chief executive have say as we have hear that jhoots risk damage the reputation of community pharmacy the government urgently need to grip this issue and ensure that patient and the staff of these pharmacy be not be let down will the minister and the secretary of state agree to meet all the member in this place whose community be affect by potential closure will he update the house at the early opportunity as to what step he be take to stabilise the crisis in community pharmacy across the country be he confident that integrate care board which be distract by cut to their budget and top down reorganisation have the capacity to deal with this urgent situation as they head into planning for the next winter crisis 
 i thank the hon member for those question i would certainly be happy to meet member who have jhoots in their constituency and be affect i will update the house we be look at strengthen the regulation but there be some constraint on what i can say because so much of this be now go through legal process there be pushback and we do not want to do anything to jeopardise the legal action we be take through the appeal process so i will have to be relatively circumspect in what i say i be happy to have those discussion and to update the house 
 i be confident that icb can take this forward in most case across the country our assessment be that there be a pharmacy within striking distance of a jhoot but certainly in those area where there be not that may require particular follow up action my official and i will be follow up with those icb to ensure that the appropriate action be be take 
 member of staff from jhoots pharmacy in laceby road have be to see i they have be go into work but they have not be pay since july it be absolutely appalling can the minister set out what pressure he and the department can bring to bear on this chain which have now unfortunately close its door for good 
 i agree with absolutely every word that my hon friend have just say it be completely unacceptable that people be come into work do an honest day ’s work and then not receive an honest day ’s pay unfortunately there be a limit to what we can do because pharmacy be private business and each employer be require to fulfil their legal obligation to pay their staff i recommend that the member of staff she mention contact acas and their trade union the pda if they be not already in touch for those who be not member of that union i strongly recommend join a trade union and seek legal advice from it that be a vital part of what trade union do they need to take action to force jhoots to do the right thing 
 i thank my friend and neighbour   the hon member for west dorset edward morello for secure this urgent question i have exactly the same problem as he and   the hon   member for north somerset sadik al hassan but in shaftesbury in my constituency i thank the staff of boots who be pick up such a huge amount of slack because jhoots be not there there be a danger to the member of staff who be on duty because there be prescribe drug on the premise and she be the only person there and i worry for her safety what additional support can the department give to exist provider such as boots that be pick up the slack particularly during the winter peak in term of advice to patient and administer vaccine 
 this be a clear breach of contract but i be tell by our icb that it do not fall within contract law the regulation be moot on this point because the circumstance that jhoots find itself in be never envisage when the regulation be write that be the problem that the minister have identify there seem to be some timidity among official and other on the overhang threat of a judicial review be the government to act in extremis to introduce some urgency i urge the minister to take that risk on behalf of all our constituent i certainly welcome his offer follow the suggestion of   the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan that all member of parliament with constituent affect by this dire problem should be involve in meeting i look forward to that so that we can provide timely advice update and support to our constituent who be rightly worried 
 i pay tribute to the boots employee in the hon member ’s constituency where jhoots be not provide the service that be require we appreciate that i can assure he that nothing be off the table he have rightly identify the problem with the regulatory framework which be strong on pharmacist pharmacist premise and pharmacy staff but there be something of a gap when it come to regulate pharmacy business owner that gap have be identify and i have commission my official to work on that at pace i will happily keep he update on that work 
 i thank the minister for the context and the response he have provide so far jhoot in my constituency of gillingham and rainham have provide an incredibly poor service not pay staff not dispense vital medicine and often not open on time however any replacement pharmacy or provider can not come in because the local pharmaceutical need assessment suggest that there be function provision will the minister consider a review of the criterion surround pnas so that they not only list those pharmacy that be available but also look at failure such as the one we be see with jhoot by recognise that other provider can take their place if need be 
 my hon friend have put her finger on an issue within all this which be that if we be look to bring in other pharmacy to replace jhoots or indeed to take over a jhoots store we can not do that in the latter case until such time as there be an insolvency and that business be no long a go concern there be a process set out in legislation for open new pharmacy potential new pharmacy contractor can apply to open in an area and evidence how a new pharmacy can provide benefit for patient but it be a challenge for they to make such a case if a jhoots   pharmacy be still list as open and provide service it be something of a catch-22 situation we have to resolve the issue with jhoots and take the necessary action and then we can see where we be with potential gap in the market 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 the case of jhoots be clearly hugely unfortunate give the incredible work that community pharmacy do up and down the country for our constituent i be pleased to hear the minister say that this case will not negatively affect the funding settlement but it be set against the backdrop of a very precarious sector where actor who want to do good by our community and do a high quality job often find that they simply can not make end meet and bad actor find a way to move in when the committee look last at this issue the workforce be a key plank to why the sector be not sustainable what update can the minister give we on the inclusion of pharmacist in the workforce plan 
 i thank the hon lady and pay tribute to her work as chair of the select committee i be very proud of the fact that we deliver a £ uplift to pharmacy—19 across the year period it be the high uplift of any sector not just of my portfolio but the entire nhs i be also very proud of the fact that we be take forward hub and speak legislation to enable pharmacist and pharmacy technician to operate at the top of their licence the day before yesterday we sign off on a statutory instrument to improve the ability of technician to do more in the area of dispense we be look to empower the workforce and enable they to operate at the top of their licence that be a fundamental part of the shift from hospital to community that be at the heart of our year plan 
 jhoots pharmacy move into the village of knott end in and it be not long before constituent be get in touch with i to explain that they could not access their prescription because pharmacy be closed and unreliable we do have the very good over wyre medical centre which have dispense right but it be restrain by the mile rule which mean that it can not dispense prescription within mile of a pharmacy whether that be open or closed i feel like we be in a catch-22 situation what help can the minister give my constituent to ensure that those who be within mile of the jhoots pharmacy that be never open can access their prescription from the dispensing over wyre medical centre 
 my hon friend rightly put her finger on the catch-22 situation in which we find ourselves it be patently absurd that a pharmacy that be not operate as she just describe be block the ability of other to step in and fill the gap that be something we have to resolve and it be part of the work i have commission urgently we clearly have gap in the regulatory framework this be an unprecedented situation and we be work at pace to address it but she have rightly put her finger on this catch-22 which need to be resolve we need to move piece out of the way so that we can deal with the situation 
 the way jhoots be treat its workforce the community and supplier be frankly appalling it be fail community who desperately rely on it the government be plan to introduce a health bill at some point in the come month that will see the abolition of nhs england can the minister update the house on when the bill will come forward and what provision it will contain to strengthen accountability for the delivery of community pharmacy 
 i know that my colleague the minister of state for health be work hard on the drafting process for the bill i can not give the hon member the exact date of its introduction but i would be very happy to write to he with confirmation of the expect introduction date 
 i be pleased that this urgent question have be secure because i have write to the minister about this company i be also grateful to my hon friend   the member for north somerset sadik al hassan who have give i advice in the matter i be pleased that the government be take regulatory action in respect of the quality safety and availability of the service but i be horrified to hear that several of my constituent work for this company have go unpaid for several week please could the minister reach out to the relevant minister within the department for business and trade to see what else we can do for those people because it be simply not right that they be out of pocket 
 that be an excellent suggestion i will do that we be hear colleague after colleague say that staff be not be pay and if there be clear evidence of a breach of employment law we absolutely need to look at that i will follow up on my hon friend ’s suggestion 
 we have hear again this afternoon the line from the minister that pharmacy staff be employ not by the nhs but by pharmacy business and that this be just a dispute between staff and the pharmacy business that should be raise in the instance with acas holli froggatt from sidmouth a former member of jhoots staff have write to i to say that staff have email jhoots beg for their wage as they have empty bank account in normal circumstance the government like to lean on pharmacy to take the pressure off gps with such scheme as pharmacy so how can the minister simply wash his hand of this situation when staff have go for month without pay 
 i do not think that be an accurate characterisation of what i be say i be say that we be take action against jhoots from the regulatory point of view and there be clearly a glaring issue with the payment of staff that need to be take forward through the industrial relation process both through acas and the pda we will give all the support we can to both those organisation to ensure that jhoots be hold to account 
 my constituent in sedbergh a rural market town have suffer greatly from the terrible pharmacy provision by   jhoots medicine have be unavailable the pharmacy have often be close and staff and locum pharmacist be go unpaid yet pay slip be be issue so it be very hard for they to claim benefit i have write to the minister and meet with the integrate care board doctor and neighbouring pharmacist i say neighbouring but this be in westmorland which be a minute drive away have step in to help as have the parish council can the minister outline what action he be take nationally to force jhoots to provide a well service for my constituent 
 we be actively work with integrate care board nhs england the general pharmaceutical council and indeed trade union to ensure that all of these issue be be take forward and give the urgency that they require sadly as i have point out the regulatory framework be not adequate it be very focused on pharmacist and pharmacy premise and inadequately and insufficiently focus on business owner that be something that must be address as a matter of urgency and we be work on it at pace 
 the failure of jhoots be put unsustainable pressure on other pharmacy across my constituency but talk have not even begin on pharmacy funding beyond march of next year give the urgent situation with jhoot will the minister review the timescale for those talk so that our pharmacy that be have to pick up this extra work can have some certainty about future funding 
 this be absolutely urgent as the hon member rightly say i have commission official to work on this matter at pace we can clearly see that this be a matter of national significance simply by the number of colleague in the chamber i can give the hon member that assurance and i would be happy to update he once i have a well sense of the exact timeframe and deadline we will be insist that thing happen as a matter of urgency 
 over the recess i meet the singh family who run pharmacy in my constituency the family be clear that despite improve funding they be still struggle with overly complex funding formula delayed payment high energy price and drug shortage among other challenge however the positive initiative of pharmacy and the independent prescribing pathfinder programme offer a ray of hope will the minister commit to continue to invest time and energy in expand those programme and meet my pharmacy from rushcliffe to discuss they far 
 we remain absolutely committed to the independent prescribing service and be work on the plan and strategy to make that a reality we continue to support pharmacy but sadly take up of it have not be as good as we would have like it to be the way it be structure and incentivise have not enable it to realise its full potential and we be work on that as well a number of error be make by the previous government who do not set pharmacy up to succeed to the extent that it should have do 
 jhoots pharmacy have reveal the severe financial strain face community pharmacy the town of glastonbury and bruton be home to fantastic independent pharmacy continue to serve their community despite more than half of pharmacy owner lose money last year how will the government ensure that the regulatory framework be robust so that community pharmacy service in rural area can remain resilient and accessible 
 the hon member be right this be about make the regulatory framework more robust as i have point out it be robust on pharmacist on technician and on pharmacy premise but it be simply not strong enough when it come to pharmacy business owner the unprecedented case of jhoots be throw that into sharp relief that be what we be work on at pace i will be happy to update she once we have some clear progress on the plan and strategy to beef up the regulatory framework to ensure that this kind of thing can never happen again 
 last week i meet staff from jhoots pharmacy in thorley and be shock when they tell i that they have be unpaid for month but be still work some be struggle with their mortgage or unable to afford food for their child ’s school lunch their concern be for their resident many of whom be elderly and vulnerable who have be leave without essential medication because of stock issue and unexpected closure they be good decent people who want to provide a community service for our resident will the minister assure my constituent directly that the department will look at all possible option and work across government where relevant to address the situation that allow this to become a problem and the specific situation affect my constituent now 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s constituent who be clearly go through an extremely difficult and challenging time i strongly recommend that they contact acas and the pda or another trade union if they happen to be a member of his key point be about how we can ensure that this do not happen again the gphc be take enforcement action against individual pharmacy and we have to wait for the outcome of those action some of those be go through appeal process as soon as of those action have conclude that will greatly facilitate and catalyse the process for go after any pharmacy that be not deliver to the service standard that we would expect 
 staff and patient at jhoots pharmacy in south wootton in north west norfolk have be let down go month without pay or stock and with no communication from management the pharmacist leave after non payment when i raise those issue with the company it simply refuse to respond the minister have refer to future regulatory change but give that the pattern be repeat across the country what urgent step be he take to work with icb collectively to ensure that staff get the money they be owe and that commission service be deliver will he not rule out take action against individual director
