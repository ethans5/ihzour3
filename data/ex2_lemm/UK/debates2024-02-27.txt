it be a great pleasure to serve on the public bill committee on this bill we have a great debate and there be actually a lot of agreement across the committee room these be deeply conservative reform champion by none other than mrs thatcher start in which she continue to do throughout opposition and during her premiership 
 i gently say to opposition members of whatever party that they must not fall into the trap of make this a political football they must engage with the seriousness and complexity of these reform in part because as we have hear they do very little to advance these very significant reform during their own time in office i suspect that they back away from it because of the very significant legal challenge they would have face as we ourselves will no doubt face pretend they do not exist be not a serious position i say to the minister and the secretary of state who be aware of my comment that we must not buckle but must continue to take this forward 
 it be great to see the package of amendment lay by the government particularly new clause which be a ban on leasehold house i want the minister to think carefully about how he will address the inevitable imbalance in the creation of a tier system in which some people will have the freehold of their house but some will not there be an additional imbalance between flat in our urban area and new freehold house that point be very well make by james vitali in a policy exchange report i be slightly worried about the omission from this of retirement property so perhaps the minister could return to that 
 in committee i speak about the need to truly move towards a commonhold system i think the opposition ’s new clause be something of that nature i very much hope that as the bill go through complete its stage the government here or in the other place can look at that suggestion i think we do need to set out the future legislative scaffold for our term in office and to build on the work we have do so that we can finally get rid of this leasehold system 
 other members have mention a lot of the point i would have make about share service my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   raise that and it be of my concern my hon friend   the member for harborough neil o’brien   have do a fantastic job in talk about the lack of adoption by local authority there be also new clause which i know be again an opposition amendment and new clause and this problem be not go to go away it be a blight on many homeowner in redditch and it also go to the heart of our planning system we really do need to look at that we can not pretend that it be go to solve itself 
 i thank the minister for write to i about of my concern which be litigation cost i think new clause look at that he have reassure i that what be in this bill will go the distance in ensure that leaseholder be not subject to unjust litigation cost by their landlord that be of the case highlight by liam spender and many other these be hugely complex issue but we must tackle they 
 i want to see ground rent reduce to a peppercorn it be pure extortion and a feudal relic from medieval time when people be serf and work the land we should not have this in or in any year i refuse to believe that there be not a way through the wit of man and the considerable intelligence of ministers on the front bench to solve the issue perhaps where some financial asset be hold in pension fund i do not buy the pretence of that incredible con artist mr steve whybrow and his outfit that somehow we be robbing pensioner   i would urge anybody with an interest in this debate to look at the genuine pensioner who be fight for the right to have pure enjoyment of their own property which they richly deserve after a lifetime of working 
 i will make my final remark on forfeiture it must go the forfeiture of a long lease can not be right it can not be right that a freeholder can hold this nuclear bomb over somebody such as dennis jackson a pensioner of plantation wharf he dispute a £ service charge which lead to an £ legal bill and he have his £ flat forfeit during a minute hearing at wandsworth court i thank lease for all the work it have do to help he that just simply can not be right and we must address it i want to see we finally finish the job that mrs thatcher start when she be opposition housing spokesman in we must finish that job and i thank the minister for all the work he have do so far 
 i feel for the minister today because he must be kick himself this be probably of the few debate i have hear in this place recently where i have not hear a bad idea as constituency mp we see time and again the problem cause by retain this feudal system of leasehold and i suspect that the minister who have be look at this issue for some time be kick himself because what he would really like to do be abolish the whole thing indeed today we have hear support from across the house to do just that in the short time available let i say again to he that he would have our support to move to commonhold he talk about how commonhold be probably the well model and for those of we live in the vortex of gentrification where thousand of flat have be build in our community this be an incredibly pressing issue we know that the casework we have see over the past few year will expand as a result of leasehold continue that be why i wish to see the government change their mind perhaps in the other place about get rid of leasehold altogether and why i have be press my local authority to listen to concern of local resident who be stick with leasehold and change our local plan to make commonhold the default i hope that they have hear this debate and will rethink their opposition to that 
 i support the amendment in the name of my hon friend   the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook and wish to draw the minister ’s attention to new clause that i have table on issue with the exist system and the problem that leaseholder face with leaseholder in walthamstow i know that these issue will come up time and again 
 new clause be about the fact that although we have leasehold legislation it do not tally with our consumer legislation leaseholder pay a service charge they have a contract with freehold management company to oversee problem in their property but few resident feel empower to access right that exist under the consumer rights act to have a reasonable service within a reasonable timeframe for repair today colleague across the house have give countless example of that so let i add my own which be where my propose new clause have come from i be sorry that my hon friend   the member for lewisham east janet daby   be not here she talk about leigh court and new clause but resident in essex brewery in walthamstow have   be without hot water and heating since before christmas indeed they be still without hot water and heating with little sight of any change 
 essex brewery be build just year ago it have become apparent that the build by crest nicholson be poor at good and a downright con at worst until january this year crest nicholson be on the management committee and make more than £ in profit in the year that essex brewery be build it have make half that this year possibly less because of widespread concern about the condition of the build it have make what do someone do when they have buy possibly their home whether through shared ownership or leasehold as hundred do in that development and they find that the pipe that bring in the hot water be faulty i be sorry to say that those resident have little redress because the management company kinleigh folkard and hayward another multimillion pound organisation leave they without any explanation of why it would not repair the hot water until after christmas what a christmas present that be the grinch have strong competition 
 that be another layer of bureaucracy kfh be appoint by the essex brewery management company which be establish by the freeholder helpfavour to meet those obligation kfh tell the resident that because their insurance policy say that as long as they have water at all the property be habitable and it be not go to do anything about it that have leave hundred of resident many of they vulnerable for month on end without any hot water or heating in the current weather resident have have to boil kettle to get hot water to cleanse their baby or pay bill that they can not afford for extra heating through portable heater for those who have share ownership it be even more complicated metropolitan thames valley state that it own of those property and that it be prohibit by law from fix the problem new clause be about match consumer legislation with leasehold legislation and give resident the right of redress not say you ’ve either get to buy out the leaseholder if you want some property control or you be stick with they and wait to see i hope kfh hear this debate and be ashamed of its behaviour 
 amendment be about leasehold tribunal i know the minister speak of precedent setting but resident across the country would tell he otherwise i beg he to look at the warner property in walthamstow and at y&y management which repeatedly rip off constituent across the country   the hon member for harborough neil o'brien   be not here but he ask why people have to pay terrorism insurance in walthamstow that be the warner estate company which say that because the plane bomber live in our constituency household have to buy terrorism insurance such case come up time and again with leasehold and they do not get fix in the tribunal amendment would give precedent 
 it be   december i have be an mp for year and month to the day and i be chain to the railing of college green by cheer leaseholder thankfully they be friendly it be to illustrate that leaseholder feel that they be be prison those be the day before social medium and it be a photo op the bbc run the headline leaseholder demand more control they still do 
 since then we have have the commonhold and leasehold reform act which be an attempt to resolve some of the problem such as forfeiture of a person ’s home for a failure to pay a small service charge the ground rent grazer charge money for no service and money not be hold in trust in sink fund it be strange that after year these should be the very area that yet another bill on leasehold reform be pretend and fail to solve 
 i say fail because that be the reason i rise to support new clause table by my hon friend   the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook it be ridiculous that a landlord can take away a person ’s home worth hundred of thousand of pound for a simple failure to pay a minor service charge amounting to a couple of pound and where there be a dispute over whether the service be even provide that be why i table new clause about money be hold in trust which would implement a provision of the act that have never be bring into force we hear in committee that the policy have strong support from stakeholder include spokespeople for the property institute and the leasehold advisory service even the british property federation have campaign for this provision of the act to come into force yet it be not here in the bill of course be a time when nobody have even predict the new renti practice that freeholder and developer have since invent to extract money from homeowner for the privilege of live in their own home the scandal of leasehold house the repeat doubling of ground rent and the inclusion of commercial area and share service in any development to stop any hope of resident exercise their right to manage 
 new clause would ensure that leaseholder in mixed use building could take advantage of the government ’s policy to lift the non residential premise cap to   and to have mandatory leaseback on expensive commercial premise unless that new clause or a version of it be adopt few leaseholder in mixed use building will be able collectively to enfranchise under the bill which would be a travesty if the government do not decisively address the structural dependency rule not only for enfranchisement but for right to manage property developer will simply sidestep the new non residential premise limit by design mix use block with share service connect flat to commercial premise by an umbilical cord to deny leaseholder their right indeed article from lead law firm explain how developer can build site to ensure that block can never be eligible for collective enfranchisement and right to manage 
 new clause would provide the appropriate tribunal with the discretion to dispense with certain procedural requirement where it be satisfied that be reasonable to do it be design to deal with case where a landlord attempt to frustrate a right to manage claim by procedural mean i be grateful to mark loveday of tanfield chambers perhaps the lead authority on service charge and right to manage practice in britain for his help in draft the new clause 
 by mr loveday ’s count of the law commission ’s recommendation on right to manage few than have be specifically adopt by the government in the bill a whole industry have emerge since labour introduce the act which bring right to manage into existence whereby freeholder seek to find minor technical error by leaseholder to scupper genuine and otherwise valid right to manage claim since right to manage be a no fault regime parliament never intend for it to be an invitation to litigation by deep pocketed freeholder and their army of lawyer as mr loveday note the act ’s right to manage do have trap for the unwary and 
 the single most important problem with the right to manage namely its procedural complexity 
 with 
 these problem famous among property lawyer 
 have 
 notoriously lead to litigation on a truly industrial scale 
 i urge the minister to look again at new clause in the other place and adopt such a pragmatic amendment which would enable a tribunal to waive minor procedural mistake by leaseholder where it deem that just and convenient 
 since we have also have the grenfell tower tragedy which have expose the rotten culture of residential construction in this country member should wonder why it be that over tower block be reckon to have fire safety defect no fire stop in building void a lack of compartmentation combustible cladding and inadequate fire door that leave the resident at the mercy of landlord who literally go to the other side of the world to avoid have to pay for remediation 
 resident be subject to unfair service charge and find themselves prisoner trap in their own home unable to sell up and move on with their life this unjust system leech off ordinary people and sham we this be the only remain country in the world where residential leasehold be the default tenure for apartment living a person ’s home should not be a source of misery to they and of unjust enrichment to other 
 we be talk about the life of people who need to be free from their feudal burden that bring i to new clause which seek to restore the intent of the section major work regime in the act to what it be prior to the daejan ruling the minister be good enough in committee to confess that he be unaware of the ruling and say that he would study it with his official yesterday i receive a letter from he on some of the point i raise in committee he admit that since daejan 
 the vast majority of application for dispensation be bring by the landlord 
 however he go on to say 
 regardless of which party make the application the landlord will have to persuade the tribunal that dispensation should be grant and it will be for the leaseholder to evidence that they have suffer prejudice 
 he say 
 i recognise your concern that leaseholder have to evidence prejudice but only they be able to do so once that threshold have be meet the burden be on the landlord to rebut the impact the prejudice have have on the leaseholder 
 he conclude 
 the consequence be that an application to the tribunal be not merely rubber stamp the landlord ’s request 
 i fundamentally disagree 
 sue bright professor of land law at oxford university have be conduct research into this area and argue as follow 
 the importance attach to the consultation requirement be evidence by the fact that if the landlord fail to conduct the statutory consultation it be prevent in the current form of the consultation provision from recover more than £ from an individual tenant in relation to those work seemingly this provide a very strong incentive to comply with the requirement but the protection offer be seriously weaken by the supreme court decision in daejan investment properties ltd v benson lord neuberger say that the consultation requirement be a means to an end rather than an end in themselves he see the provision as play a support role in achieve only the end goal of consumer protection secure by section of the landlord and tenant act that is protect tenant from unreasonable service charge an alternative vision support by the dissent judgment of lord wilson acknowledge that consultation be an important end in itself this recognise that consultation have an inherent value far it be in keep both with the tenor of the new building safety regime that promote full engagement with leaseholder and resident and the thrust of contemporary government policy towards provide consumer protection to leaseholder 
 her finding be grim for supporter of leaseholder and a sense of fair play she say 
 in all of the fire safety case review for this article dispensation be grant at least in part and with a few exception the overwhelming majority be grant unconditionally even when the ftt 
 the tier tribunal 
 be critical of the way in which the applicant have manage thing 
 i also thank dr howard soper another academic who help draft the amendment who be appal by the number of successful dispensation win by freeholder that he find in his study of tier tribunal decision 
 i urge the minister to think again because this cut to of the most fundamental injustice that we have see in leasehold apartment in recent year those individual trap in building with fire safety defect   this bill be the set of reform to the leasehold tenure in year the test that i set the then labour administration be a simple i say 
 what we want be for leaseholder to be able to take control over their own life without landlord be able to say when you have a new roof how much you pay for it who do it when it ’ go to happen you should be able to decide that for yourself in your own home 
 the proposal in front of we today do not liberate leaseholder the secretary of state himself have say 
 i do not believe leasehold be fair in any way it be an outdated feudal system that need to go and we need to move to a well system and to liberate people from it 
 he be right this bill do not do that it will be leave to a future labour government 
 before we begin today ’s proceeding i should like to express my sadness on behalf of the house at the death of former member 
 ronnie campbell serve as member for blyth valley from to he be a kind and generous man well like in all part of the house and a powerful advocate for his constituent and his principle 
 there be also the tragic news of the death of lord cormack who be a member of this house for year from to he be an eminent historian of parliament as well as editor and then president of the house magazine 
 they be very different character who be unite by a strong duty to their constituent and a firm commitment to their principle they each make their mark on this house in their own way and we will miss they very much i be sure the thought of the whole house be with their family and friend 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the potential merit of introduce a social energy tariff 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the potential merit of introduce a social energy tariff 
 energy price be now at their low level for year with a typical bill set to drop by £ by april our cost of live package total over £ or £ per household on average over to we be support those most in need with million of vulnerable household receive up to £ in cost of living payment 
 some of we believe in preventative spending a house of commons library briefing last year estimate that the annual cost to the national health service of treat illness associate with live in cold or damp housing be £ when wide   societal cost be consider that figure rise to £ will the secretary of state confirm whether the introduction of a social energy tariff would cost less than £ 
 a social tariff mean lot of thing to different people but we be support vulnerable people with the cost of their energy bill we support they last winter pay on average a half of everybody ’s energy bill and we have make additional payment of £ to support people since we have increase the proportion of home that be energy efficient and insulate to up from 
 i call chris law not here 
 on energy tariff what assessment have the secretary of state make of the merit of provide resident who be local to energy and nuclear plant with discount on their energy bill 
 i thank my hon friend for her doughty campaigning for nuclear she be our very own atomic kitten we be very positive about nuclear and have set out plan for the large expansion of nuclear for year overall that will be a good thing for people ’s energy bill and the energy security of this country 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 what step she be take to support household in fuel poverty during winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 fuel poverty be a devolved matter the late figure publish on   february show that household be in fuel poverty in the government continue to deliver financial support to low income home and vulnerable household through the warm home discount scheme and cost of living payment 
 as i be sure you be aware mr speaker the cost of living crisis be far from over for constituent in our area the government ’s late energy efficiency policy the great british insulation scheme be suppose to insulate home a year but so far just family have be help in month include only home in lancashire and just in blackburn will the minister explain why currently it will take year to meet their year target 
 energy efficiency be incredibly important to this government and we have many scheme available the great british insulation scheme alone have commit £ 
 i hear what the minister say about the great british insulation scheme it come after the green deal and the green home grant but frankly it look like another failure there be people live in south yorkshire but just of their home have be upgrade under the gbis my constituent want their bill cut emission reduce and their home insulate but government incompetence be stand in the way when will the minister get a grip 
 we be spend £ in this parliament and a furth £ up to to make building include private rented property clean and warmer that be in addition to the estimate £ that will be deliver for eco4 the energy company obligation and the great british insulation scheme up to march 
 over the past year my constituent in motherwell and wishaw as well as the disability group that i engage with have tell i harrowing tale of dire fuel poverty and energy debt while the energy giant post record profit even with the new price cap national energy action estimate that there will be uk household in fuel poverty with energy debt sit at £ after april the only support available will be the £ warm home discount which have barely be increase in a decade when will the government take meaningful action and finally consult on an energy social tariff 
 last winter this government deliver £ for household and business we also have the warm home discount the winter fuel payment and the disability cost of live payment we be committed to ensure that affordability be top of our list in relation to energy security 
 we have have year of fiasco after fiasco with energy save scheme from this government frankly my constituent be feed up with it in gateshead just home have be upgrade under the government ’s late energy efficiency scheme can the minister say why this be such a disaster and why progress be so slow 
 we continue to drive energy efficiency improvement for low income and fuel poor household through scheme include the energy company obligation the social housing decarbonisation scheme and the home upgrade grant 
 a recent report from the energy and climate intelligence unit expose the government ’s record on insulation and say that the government ’s false claim about their success mostly involve take credit for scheme that be a legacy of the last labour government a record low of around measure be instal in total under the government ’s programme in be not the truth that this government be fail million of people in fuel poverty 
 this government have provide unprecedented support for people in this country i have regular meeting with stakeholder charity and different organisation undoubtedly we be make sure that people have support through as i have mention the warm home discount the energy price cap and lot of other payment such as the cost of live payment of £ per annum 
 talk of fuel poverty the boiler tax result in consumer pay an extra £ when they purchase a new boiler do the minister agree that it be now time to ditch these unworkable and unaffordable net policy and let the british people decide how to heat their home and what car to drive so that they can keep more of their own money 
 no decision have yet be take on that but we have a commitment to ensure that we get the very good deal for all our constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 a year ago the then energy secretary say that if supplier have wrongly instal prepayment meter in any home they would have to recompense their customer for the way they have behave year later can the minister tell the house how many individual who have a prepayment meter wrongly instal have have compensation how many be yet to receive it and of those still wait when they will get the compensation 
 thing on which we can all agree across the house be that it be absolutely abhorrent that people have prepayment meter force on they we be work our way through the compensation but i can assure members that we be do everything we can to ensure that when prepayment meter be instal we be do exactly the right thing to make sure that everybody be keep safe 
 i ask the minister question but do not get an answer to any of they perhaps she can put the figure in the house of commons library because she clearly do not have a clue what they be 
 more than household be in debt to their energy supplier and almost household be live in cold damp and poorly insulate home the great british insulation scheme be prove to be a great tory insulation fiasco will the minister tell i why the insulation scheme be prove to be such a disaster 
 we have take great step to support people for example last winter we give unprecedented support to household and business of course debt be a major concern and i have regular meeting with stakeholder to ensure that we be do the very good not only to get people out of debt but to prevent they get into debt in the place 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on deliver new nuclear power station 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 the civil nuclear road map reconfirm the government ’s ambition to deploy up to gw of nuclear power by it set out plan to make investment decision about gw to gw every year between and 
 i thank the minister for his answer new nuclear hold the key not only to ensure energy security but to create thousand of high skille well pay job in the area where it be locate but too often the planning process can take year even on site where there be long establish nuclear use have he discuss with ministerial colleague what can be do to shorten that process significantly 
 i can confirm that i have have those conversation and the government be explore the potential for reduce regulatory burden for the consenting and licensing of new nuclear power station without impact safety security or environmental protection we be also look to introduce a range of other streamline measure include the action plan for reform which set out reform to the nationally significant infrastructure project regime 
 will the minister confirm that nuclear decommissioning authority own land adjacent to sellafield will be make available for new nuclear more specifically will enough land be make available to accommodate mw rolls royce power station and their ancillary building and space 
 i can confirm that moorside be indeed a candidate for new nuclear and it be of a number of potential site for host civil nuclear project great british nuclear be currently run a competitive process to select those small modular reactor technology well able to facilitate operational project in the 2030s that say the project need to run its course and i know my hon friend will understand that no decision on site have yet be make 
 the uk ’s nuclear fusion power plant be due to be build a short minute drive from lincoln it will increase energy generation and hopefully limit the amount of agricultural land be use to house solar farm will my hon friend update the house on the role that institution such as the university of lincoln will have in provide research and training for these type of power plant and their associate advanced job of the future 
 it be indeed a very exciting time for fusion in this country our fusion futures programme will provide up to £ over year to train more than people help meet the demand of our grow fusion sector that will expand our exist fusion training programme through work with university such as the university of lincoln college and employer   and provide a pipeline of highly skilled scientist engineer and technician at all career level from apprentice to post doctoral fellow 
 berkeley have secure incredibly exciting investment in nuclear innovation with a consortium involve rolls royce and the university of bristol a low carbon energy park with international status at berkeley and oldbury next door go hand in hand as the severn edge project the government have a good opportunity to meet their energy security ambition and lead the way will my hon friend provide assurance that he will work with western gateway on severn edge i hear he say that the competition have to run its course but will the course be run ahead of the summer recess 
 my hon friend be tempt i oldbury be a candidate for new nuclear and of a number of potential site that could host civil nuclear project it be exciting and encouraging to see the number of site and project come forward for investment as i say the competition have to run its course and no decision on site have be make but it be very encouraging to see such interest across the country in our great nuclear future 
 nuclear power plant come with a huge up front capital cost even small modular reactor have a considerable price tag so it be important that the government get their procurement right for once do the minister agree that smr offer possibility for economy of scale a large number could be commission at once give potential saving to the taxpayer while deliver reliable baseload supply to the national grid 
 yes of course i agree that be of the huge benefit along with many other of small modular reactor which be why we be run our down selection programme and support export from this country to across the world so that other country can join we on our nuclear journey invest in small modular advanced modular and gigawatt scale project over the next few year 
 the delivery of nuclear power station for northern ireland be something that i would welcome but other party in northern ireland might have concern about it the thing that we in northern ireland can all agree on be that as part of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we must be part of the manufacture base and procurement process can the minister confirm that the people of northern ireland will have that opportunity 
 not only can i confirm that but   i put on record my support to all the company in northern ireland that be already integral to the supply chain for our nuclear sector our nuclear revival not only will deliver a more secure robust and clean energy baseload but have the potential to create thousand of new manufacturing and supply chain job across the country and i want that to impact positively on every corner of our united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 i call the shadow minister 
 contrary to propaganda from the conservative side the last labour government hand over a detailed nuclear development plan that run up to with site identify for nuclear development early discussion with nuclear developer and a plan for a deep and secure nuclear repository since then over year not electron of new nuclear power have be produce hinkley c be now at risk of further delay and no progress at all have be make on the establishment of a secure storage site for nuclear waste what assurance can the minister give that lesson have be learn from that frankly fairly lamentable stewardship of the previous plan and that the late plan be set up to deliver 
 i have never be accuse of propagandise before it be a matter of pride on the conservative benches that every single nuclear project that have ever be complete in this country have be complete under a conservative government it do not look as though that be likely to change any time soon despite the protestation and near damascene conversion of labour front benchers on nuclear over the past few year we be carry on with our nuclear revival we have set out our nuclear road map and we be encouraging enthuse and invest in our civil nuclear sector i be very excited about the progress that we have make and what will take place in the sector over the next few year 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure that land use for food production be not use for solar installation 
 the planning policy priority be the effective use of land by direct solar project to locate on previously develop low grade land and it be design to avoid mitigate and where necessary compensate for impact on the good agricultural land 
 the prime minister be very clear that vast swathe of agricultural land would not be lose to solar on his watch yet i be see thousand of acre across my constituency be build out or propose for solar from kimble wick to dinton ford to beachampton and more include the late acre abomination in the claydon know as rosefield good agricultural land that regularly produce wheat harvest of tonne per hectare for example be often falsely grade as 3b because the reading be take from the headland not the field when will my hon friend ensure that energy policy do not trump food security and stop the mass proliferation of agricultural land be use for inefficient solar 
 i understand the concern and frustration of my hon friend and his constituent that particular project be at the pre application planning stage the application be expect to be submit to the planning   inspectorate between january and march however as i know he understand owe to the quasi judicial role of ministers in determine application it would not be appropriate for i to comment on any specific matter in relation to that project but i can reassure he that all application be judge on their individual merit and i encourage he and all his affected constituent to engage with the planning process at every stage as it continue 
 with all due respect to conservative members who always represent the farming industry as do we in the liberal democrats farmer be not stupid they will not take high quality agricultural land out of production and that be not happen so i really worry about the argument be make here we be far behind our renewable target for solar so what incentive can the government provide to get more not less uk solar off the ground 
 i can reassure the hon lady that the solar taskforce will publish its recommendation imminently and we have an ambitious target of deploy gw of solar across the uk by 
 resident in staffordshire moorlands be very concerned about a number of planning application for solar farm and battery storage plant on farmland they have a number of question so can my hon friend ensure that small district council have the appropriate expertise to look at those application can he make sure that proximity to the national grid be take into consideration and that when there be a number of application relate to adjoining piece of land those application be consider as a whole rather than look at individually 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question and reassure she that we take all those concern incredibly seriously i be very happy to meet she and any other member of parliament who have concern about the plan be put forward in their constituency as i have say it be really important that everybody from member of parliament through to those in the community who be affect by or have concern about plan can engage with the planning process at every stage we will do what we can to address those concern while meet our ambitious target of deploy gw of solar by 
 i be delighted to see you in your place mr speaker some people have short memory 
 bear in mind the difficulty that farmer be face particularly those with rocky or infertile land will the minister have discussion with his colleague in the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs to ensure that some of that land be use in way that maximise the benefit to the farming community as well as contribute to net 
 i thank the hon member for his question i can assure he that we be already engage with the national farmers union indeed it have be work with the solar taskforce to enable we to work with farmer and understand their concern i be very   happy to meet farming representative from all part of the united kingdom to determine how we can well support they and reach our net objective by the date we have set ourselves 
 of the argument put forward for a large solar farm on agricultural land in my constituency be that there be limited point of interconnection with the national grid for large solar farm developer wish to contract with it could my hon friend the minister advise i on whether that be the case and if it be could he follow up on that and advise all member of parliament on where those limitation exist 
 i thank my hon friend for his question obviously i do not know the detail of the case he raise but i be very happy to meet he follow question to look at it in more detail despite what i say about the quasi judicial role of ministers in planning application it be really important that all concern be address and look at and that the planning application system be thorough robust and transparent 
 on land use for food production and achieve net have the minister do an impact assessment of the rise carbon emission from the uk government carry on with their agricultural policy which be reduce incentive for farmer to produce food as a consequence we will import more food as thing stand we produce only of the food we eat import more and more food will surely increase carbon emission have the minister look into that and do an impact assessment of it 
 at the national farmers union conference just last week the prime minister reiterate this government ’s commitment to support british farmer in their primary role of deliver food for the nation it would be good to see the liberal democrats give their support to british farmer in so forceful a manner we be absolutely determined to do what we can to support british farmer in continue to deliver that food and indeed to support the technology that we need to reach our net commitment which i be lead to believe the liberal democrats still support 
 whether she have have discussion with energy provider on reduce energy standing charge for charity and business 
 the setting of tariff include stand charge in the non domestic market be a commercial matter for supplier the secretary of state and i have meet supplier and ofgem multiple time over the past year to urge they to support business and keep bill down and ofgem have recently call for input and view on stand charge 
 mr speaker i associate myself with your early remark about the sad passing of my dear friend ronnie campbell and indeed lord cormack 
 for month now east durham trust in my constituency have be in dispute with its supplier totalenergies after totalenergies raise its standing charge from 40p a day to £ a day an increase of over remarkably after make complaint to the department ofgem northern powergrid and totalenergies i find out just yesterday that totalenergies have agree to remotely reconfigure the meter in question can the minister explain why energy company and distributor do not seek to address customer issue soon and do she agree that we have a fail regulator and an energy system that seek to maximise profit 
 i be pleased to hear from the hon gentleman that the situation have be resolve and i suggest that exactly the right recourse be to contact the relevant party we be now launch the ability of the ombudsman to help small business as well which reassure i that such case will be see to more quickly and resolve soon 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 in the uk electricity standing charge will balloon by mean that people in scotland who be pay £ a year in will soon need to find £ a year a increase under this tory government that remove the incentive to curb excessive use and present a disincentive to economise on energy usage if cost and charge be redistribute to the unit price consumer would be empower to pursue reduced usage know that that would translate into low bill what assessment have the minister make of the saving that would be make in term of both carbon emission and the need for vast piece of new energy infrastructure if the standing charge be roll into unit price 
 standing charge as i mention be a matter for ofgem however ofgem have listen to public sentiment and it have recently launch a call for input on standing charge my understanding be that to date it have have over response the call for input close on   january and ofgem ’s paper aim to ensure a great understanding of how standing charge be apply to energy bill and what alternative should be consider 
 what step she be take to help increase private sector investment in green technology 
 what step she be take to help increase private sector investment in green technology 
 the uk have already make tremendous progress in secure investment in green technology recent figure indicate that there be £ of investment in the uk in mean that since the uk have have £ of public and private investment in low carbon sector since i take office in september we have put in place new policy and sign deal with different country and the investment have   continue to flow with plan for around £ of new investment in low carbon sector announce by the private sector 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer harmony energy base in knaresborough open europe ’s large battery farm in yorkshire in it have raise the issue of connectivity challenge be a blockage to investment so i welcome the connection action plan which aim to cut connection time by up to battery farm be critical for energy retention and storage and be particularly helpful for renewable so may i ask my right hon friend for an update on how the plan be be implement 
 we have set out the most radical reform to the grid since the 1950s as the action plan set out we be take action with ofgem and network company to accelerate those really important network connection network company be offer early connection to battery storage and generation project for example gw of battery storage project be already be offer connection date to the transmission network that be on average year early than be originally agree 
 the uk ’s ceramic sector have invest heavily in energy efficiency technology and it be commit to go far but many of the alternative green technology be not yet viable and there be serious risk that too stringent net target will result in carbon leakage and in offshore an industry and skilled job to country that have a far bad environmental record will my right hon friend look seriously at exempt the ceramics sector from the emission trading scheme to give the sector the breathing space that it need to invest 
 i commend my hon friend ’s unwavering commitment to advocate for the ceramics sector in his constituency the uk government remain steadfast in safeguard sector deem at risk of carbon leakage and i strongly encourage the ceramics sector in his constituency to actively participate in the consultation on free allocation policy which be open 
 a new report from the green finance institute and the institute for public policy research note that a lack of public investment and strategy be hold back progress on unlock private investment and that the chopping and changing of policy pathway have damage investor confidence the secretary of state like to say that she have a clear strategy so will she tell investor what it be will she call on the chancellor to deliver the scale of public investment that we so urgently need to restore investor confidence and lift the uk off the bottom of the g7 league table for private investment where we currently languish 
 i thank the hon lady for that question but i be surprised that she do not welcome the recent news that the uk be the country in the g20 to halve its emission since the 1990 as i know that subject be dear to her heart as i have say in the uk see around £ of low carbon private and public investment we get that extraordinary success   by encourage private investment whether through the contract for difference scheme our new policy on capital allowance or the effect of the green industry growth accelerator on the supply chain the uk be do everything it can to attract investment and that be exactly why we have make those achievement 
 last week the scottish government announce £ of public investment in a new cable factory which will attract a furth £ of inward investment do the secretary of state agree that the good way to increase private investment be for the government to increase public investment to signal that the uk be open to green investment should not the uk government therefore invest at least £ a year so that we can maximise private investment and so that economic growth from the green transition be also maximise 
 as i say our record on net investment be incredibly strong in fact i believe the cbi have a report out this morning show that our net sector have be grow by in the last year we have set out plan for further investment whether that be in grid connection supply chain investment through our gigafund or reform capital allowance all those thing and not public sector investment alone attract private investment to this country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this government be lock in a doom loop of inertia and everyone be talk about it just this week the national infrastructure commission say that the government be take too long need to move fast and that great urgency be require the cbi report that the secretary of state mention say that 
 strong future growth from green business be be put at risk 
 labour ’s national wealth fund will crowd in private investment and create thousand of good job for plumber engineer electrician and welder be blow our advantage and lose the race for the industry of the future part of the government ’s plan or do they just not have 
 i thank the hon lady for have the chutzpah to attempt that question if she would like to talk about uncertainty on investment plan she need only look at those on the benches behind she who have perform the most extraordinary flip flop on that we have deliver the high cumulative amount of record low carbon investment across europe over the past year 
 if she will meet representative of adfree cities to discuss high carbon advertising 
 the advertising standards authority be responsible for regulate advertising in the uk across traditional form of medium and it take environmental issue seriously i encourage the hon gentleman to approach the asa directly with that request as it operate independently of government 
 i call barry sheerman 
 thank you for wake i up mr speaker the adfree cities campaign be very significant most of we have see flash coloured screen proliferate in our town and city and much more densely in other country such as france and germany not only do these screen use a lot of energy and electricity but they be very invasive of people ’s dwelling can we be very careful about the proliferation of those screen 
 as i say the asa would be the key people to go to company in the sector be and should be mindful of their net obligation they be look into make commitment to source all their electricity from renewable source which be a solid thing to do as well as use digital technology to minimise energy usage the net council be produce road map for all industry sector across the economy to encourage business to do everything they can to minimise their environmental impact 
 what step she be take to help reduce the price of fuel at petrol station 
 last week we launch a consultation close on   march on require petrol station to report a change in price within minute pumpwatch will enable driver to make informed decision on where to buy fuel and will reignite competition 
 i thank the minister for her answer but my constituent in stafford remain concerned about the price of fuel particularly give the pressure on their household budget i welcome the fact that the price of a tank of fuel be low than it be when price be at their peak but what be she do to ensure that my constituent get the good price for their fuel 
 we be committed to make sure that consumer get a fair deal that be why fuel retailer must remain transparent and not overcharge driver the pumpwatch consultation will require all petrol station to report price within minute of their changing that will enable tech company to develop new way for uk driver to search for the cheap fuel 
 in rural community across devon people feel the pressure of high fuel cost the cost of fuel in town such as honiton be almost 20p a litre high than at petrol station just mile away what step will the government take to ensure fairness and to introduce rural fuel duty relief of the sort that we already have in some part of north devon 
 pumpwatch will help with those thing but it be unacceptable for any fuel retailer to overcharge driver that be why the secretary of state hold a roundtable in december with fuel retailer to make it clear that we expect they to pass on saving to consumer when price fall 
 what recent step she have take to help improve the energy efficiency of home 
 i pay tribute to the hon member for her committed work to support her constituent live in rural area we have a proud record of energy efficiency we be encouraging rather than force people to make the right choice and we push back the ban on gas boiler while increase the boiler upgrade scheme to £ which be of the most generous grant in europe 
 there be list property in north shropshire accord to the listed property owners club and conservation area across our historical market town and village that mean that there be a large number of building that owner find it difficult to upgrade to make they energy efficient what conversation have the minister have with her colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities and the department for culture media and sport on enable people to bring those home into the century and make they energy efficient 
 the hon member make a good point we have those consultation across department and local authority in rural area in england be eligible for grant i can give my assurance that we have those cross government meeting 
 many off grid home across cornwall can not convert to energy efficient heating scheme without incur huge cost option for they be to use hydro treat vegetable oil can the minister lie out what plan the government have to support those use renewable liquid heating fuel and will she back the campaign by our excellent candidate for camborne and redruth connor donnithorne to axe the tax on hvos 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point we have begin develop a consultation on the role of renewable liquid fuel in heat we expect department for energy security and net ministers to receive detailed information on the shape of the consultation in the come week and aim to publish in the summer of 
 when she plan to publish the consultation on the review of electricity market arrangement 
 the government plan to publish the consultation imminently it will set out a clear direction on how the gb electricity market arrangement will evolve to keep electricity bill as low as possible for consumer of all type 
 there be question that my constituent ask i most frequently when will we see cheap electricity from renewable and when people in   area such as mine which host a lot of renewable production benefit from cheap price as a result of host that infrastructure 
 the government be move on from our appalling inheritance in of less than of our electricity come from renewable with that figure today up to well over every day we add to that we displace gas and other fossil fuel and low bill for people and we plan to keep that go we already have solar onshore wind and other developer provide benefit to consumer and we will come forward with plan for those host 
 order i call sir george howarth 
 people who be consider change their boiler struggle to find accurate information about the benefit and the cost will the minister consider issue new guidance that make clear both the cost and the benefit of switch to a heat pump 
 it can be a complex matter that be why the government have commit to look at rebalance the system cost across electricity and gas as well as to ensure that people can benefit as i do from a heat pump which provide a warm home and low bill 
 what step her department be take to help reduce energy cost for household 
 what step she be take to provide support with energy bill 
 ofgem ’s new price cap mean that from april the average bill be set to drop by £ this show that our plan be work we have halve inflation and energy price be at their low level in year alongside that we have take the number of home that be well insulate up from in to now we have recently set out plan to help more customer access smart energy tariff which could save they up to £ a year 
 i be grateful for the answer but thing my constituent in stirling do not understand be electricity standing charge as we have hear accord to ofgem ’s figure they have rocket by from £ in to £ in ofgem have issue a call for evidence which be to be welcome but ofgem be clearly not fit for purpose on this do the secretary of state agree that it be high time the uk government step in 
 the hon gentleman be right that ofgem regulate stand charge and have issue a call for evidence i think about people have give input and we look forward to see the result however if he be really worried about the cost of live for family in the country the snp would not have take taxis in scotland to the high level in the uk 
 the fall in the energy price cap be certainly welcome by carshalton and wallington resident as be the support for household but many small and medium sized business in my constituency be still struggle to absorb high cost will the secretary of state outline in a bit more detail the support that those business can access to help with energy bill 
 i thank my hon friend for recently welcome i to carshalton and wallington wholesale energy price have fall significantly since last winter but we be commit to support business with their energy bill last winter alone we deliver about £ to support business cover nearly half of many business wholesale energy cost we be continue the energy bill discount scheme to support eligible business with high energy cost until they can take advantage of low wholesale price 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 a lot have happen since i be last at the dispatch box not only have energy bill fall to their low level in year welcome news for family up and down the country but britain have become the major economy to halve our emission which be a huge milestone on our journey to net our offshore petroleum licensing bill have complete its commons stage and we be support the north sea by protect job and use our own gas to heat our home 
 i have sign a new partnership with canada on fusion energy which be a technology that could give we limitless energy and on which britain be lead the world we have confirm the uk ’s departure from the energy charter treaty which be hold back our transition to clean cheap energy we have launch a consultation on smart energy tariff which could see £ take off people ’s bill and today we host our hydrogen investor forum announce successful project to make low carbon hydrogen with over £ of government support 
 resident in esclusham in my constituency be alarm by innova ’s plan for the uk ’s large lithium ion battery storage facility near bersham can my right hon friend give any reassurance about the safety of this technology to my constituent who be concerned about the danger of pollution give the noise emit by such equipment and by report of similar facility elsewhere explode catch fire and emit toxic fume 
 electricity storage allow we to use energy more flexibly and to minimise energy bill grid scale lithium ion battery energy storage system be cover by a robust regulatory framework that be principally over- see by the health and safety executive planning guidance encourage developer and local authority to consult relevant fire and rescue service on aspect such as location ahead of any planning decision be make 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 some of household in scotland be live in extreme fuel poverty energy debt across the united kingdom have reach £ age uk estimate that have the uk government implement a social tariff this winter household would have be lift out of poverty the late cost of unpayable energy debt have once again be heap on to ordinary taxpayer by ofgem through the unit rate what assessment have the secretary of state make of how much energy debt could be reduce by through the introduction of a social tariff to mitigate totally unaffordable energy bill 
 the fact that energy price be at the low level in year be good news for family up and down the country we have put in place support include a package of more than £ to support family that be £ per household on average as part of that we have make £ cost of live payment to help people in the last year 
 energy be a vital purchase for the hospitality sector and can make up a large part of the overall cost what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that the energy cost face by pub hotel and food business do not put they out of business 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question wholesale energy price have fall compare with last year the government have be support eligible business lock into high contract through the energy bill discount scheme until they can take advantage of low fix price rate my hon friend will be interested to hear that the government deliver more than £ to non domestic energy user last winter cover around half of many business energy bill 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last september the energy secretary claim she be lift the onshore wind ban but in the whole of and so far in there have be application for new onshore wind farm design for domestic electricity supply in england she say that her decision would speed up the delivery of project why do she think it have not work 
 let i be clear about our record on onshore wind energy production have quadruple since when we have gw of onshore wind to gw in we have connect the high amount of renewable anywhere in europe whereas the right hon gentleman ’s plan have be widely discredit by industry and would deter billion of pound of investment in clean energy 
 the right hon lady do not answer the question i will tell she why it have not work because she have leave a uniquely restrictive planning regime in place for onshore wind her failure be cost family across this country £ a year on their bill   we know that her policy have fail she could dump the ban at the stroke of a pen if she be vaguely serious about clean energy why do she not face down the headbanger on her back benches and lift the ban 
 as i say we have connect the high amount of renewable electricity anywhere in europe since our record on renewable energy be clear this be the most extraordinary deflection that i have see in recent week the right hon gentleman ’s leader have shred his policy platform on energy to be honest i feel quite sorry for he because thank to the action of his leader and his shadow chancellor he have be hide away his policy have be rip up and it be now obvious to everyone that labour have no plan for energy 
 far to the question by my hon friend the member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous about the review of electricity market arrangement i welcome the fact that we be at last get to grip with the clunky old rule that add potentially hundred of pound to everyone ’s energy bill may i urge the minister to go fast this be chug along at whitehall speed and we need urgent action to reduce energy bill soon 
 i thank my hon friend for his continue interest in this issue the rema programme be consider a number of option include send more efficient locational signal which i know he be very knowledgeable about zonal pricing reform to transmission charging and change to network access the round of the consultation be imminent 
 this government ’s treatment of miner retire miner and their widow be nothing short of a national scandal since the government have be sit on the recommendation of the business energy and industrial strategy committee report which recommend review the mineworker pension scheme ’s surplus sharing arrangement in favour of miner and their widow during that time thousand of miner have sadly pass away through the legacy of industrial disease while the government have pocket £ of the miner own money since when be the government go to do the right thing and return the miner money 
 the government be do the right thing have do the right thing and will continue to do the right thing in come to a fair settlement between miner the government and the taxpayer that be what we will continue to do and i be happy to meet the hon gentleman to discuss it far 
 early this month the all party parliamentary group on infrastructure which i chair launch a joint report with the institution of civil engineers on the public behavioural change need to achieve our net target i have send my right hon friend a copy of the report as part of its production we carry out market research which highlight public uncertainty on where to go for accurate information to help people   make the choice require to decarbonise their   life what be the department do to help fill that information gap 
 of course my hon friend have a highly distinguished history in the marketing industry we agree that it be important that the public get the information they need to save money on their bill as we set out in the net growth plan that be why last autumn we relaunche the it all add up campaign which help british household save an estimate £ last winter whether it be elf on the shelf or other such route we will find way to well communicate with the public precisely to allow they to be well informed in do their bit for net 
 the under secretary of state for energy security and net the hon member for derby north amanda solloway speak about the government ’s approach to differential fuel price in different town motorist in chesterfield remain mystified as to why major supermarket be charge they more than they charge customer just a few mile up the road in sheffield it be clear that the government ’s approach be not work when i write to the major supermarket they admit that they charge chesterfield customer more there be no reason why customer in chesterfield should be charge more than customer in sheffield so will the minister tell we what she be do about that 
 i could not agree more that we should not be pay different price at different petrol station that be of the reason why we have launch a consultation on pumpwatch and why we have very regular meeting with the supplier to make sure that they be not do this they should not be do it and we be very clear about that 
 offshore energies uk ’s industry manifesto highlight the once- in a lifetime opportunity that a home grow energy transition provide to bring investment and job to community all around the uk this require close collaboration between the private and public sector can ministers confirm that the government be absolutely committed to such a partnership 
 i can what the sector do not need of course as oeuk have itself set out be the ten of thousand of job loss that would be drive by the ideological and climate damage obsession of   the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband   with end new uk oil and gas licensing 
 the last publish government estimate for sizewell c be £ but hinkley point c the suppose prototype for sizewell c be now estimate to cost £ when will the government admit that the actual cost of sizewell c will be a colossal £ noose around bill payer neck 
 the snp blind by a misplaced belief in its own exceptionalism seem almost alone in the world in not recognise the benefit of new nuclear when it come to meet our net objective deliver our energy security and improve   our baseload at last year ’s cop country around the world come together to commit to increase nuclear generate capacity by it would be brilliant if scotland could be part of that change but the snp and its luddite partner in the green party be hold scotland back we be determined not to do that for the rest of the uk 
 plan for a new incinerator in wisbech be strongly oppose by my constituent and those of my right hon friend the members for north west cambridgeshire shailesh vara and for south west norfolk elizabeth truss with lorry trip a day and a structure big than ely cathedral there would be serious health and environmental concern for the near school will my right hon friend the secretary of state visit the site to see for herself why the plan be wholly inappropriate 
 the secretary of state will be happy to engage with my hon friend and i too would be delighted to visit the site to look into the issue that he have raise 
 at last we have hear the excellent news from stellantis that it be to build electric van at luton ’s vauxhall plant from as a result of the tireless effort of both management and workforce in pursuit of efficiency and quality what plan have the government to invest in electric vehicle charge infrastructure to help to stimulate the ev consumer market 
 the hon lady be right to salute the astonishing investment that we be see throughout the automotive sector and i be delighted that the government have be able to help to bring they about as she know we be commit to spread more and more charging across the united kingdom not least in motorway service area so that we have the infrastructure to facilitate the decarbonisation of transport alongside all our other emitter 
 early this month we welcome the prime minister to a&p falmouth to meet its workforce and talk about its fantastic submission for funding under the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme to enable the port of falmouth to support the emerge float offshore wind sector in the celtic sea can the minister reassure my constituent that the government be look at all the application with a scrutinise eye to ensure that the supply chain can be build up throughout the south west 
 i can indeed confirm that the supply chain and the manufacture job that will be create through our investment in float offshore wind will benefit every community in the united kingdom no decision have yet be make on flowmis but will be make imminently 
 government statistic release last week show that low income household in the north west live in energy inefficient property hundred of household in the fishwick area of preston be still struggle with cold damp home after the fail installation of insulation more than a decade ago will the minister commit his   department to future fuel poverty scheme that will prioritise the fixing of past mistake as well as renew support for good insulation to be fit in old terrace property around the country 
 the government be already commit to ensure that household have the necessary energy efficiency we have introduce the social housing decarbonisation boiler upgrade scheme the home upgrade grant and many other initiative and we be of course help all our constituent with affordability 
 we have make huge progress in decarbonise our electricity sector but decarbonise transport and heat be much more tricky will the minister encourage our plan in copeland to harness any power that can be obtain from new nuclear for that purpose and will he meet we so that we can discuss those plan 
 i should as ever be delighted to meet my hon friend and very happy to discuss the opportunity that be open up for her community and other throughout the united kingdom indeed i have visit her constituency and observe for myself the huge enthusiasm for new nuclear as well as the additional benefit that it can bring to the wide energy sector 
 the potential loss of job at tata steel in port talbot be devastating for worker and their family with possible knock on effect for trostre in llanelli as well as invest in the electric arc furnace will the government commit themselves to primary green steelmaking in the uk to preserve our security and our job 
 the hon lady should alongside we celebrate the £ that the government be contribute as part of an overall £ investment in the modernisation of steel production at port talbot through for instance the electric arc furnace government and industry will also invest £ in skill to ensure that there be thousand of job for the future and that we reduce emission as well 
 will my hon friend reaffirm the government ’s commitment to develop operational ccus cluster include acorn in my constituency by the end of the decade will my colleague in the department for energy security and net make representation to his majesty ’s treasury to bring forward the financial investment decision at the soon opportunity 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and he be absolutely right ccus have such an important role and we be commit to those cluster as we announce in march last year we have deliver £ of investment to make sure that we carry on with the transformation and decarbonisation of this country that be so woefully lacking when we take power in 
 last week the former prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss share a platform with an extremist far right climate change deny conspiracy theorist call steve bannon who claim that man make global warming be a manufacture crisis will the   secretary of state condemn those crazy comment and perhaps distance herself from the former prime minister 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question what he should look at carefully be that the uk be the country in the g20 to halve emission if he want to look at our record he should look at that it be absolutely extraordinary that no on the opposition benches have welcome that news today 
 national grid ’s grimsby to walpole project will see pylon drive across lincolnshire ’s beautiful landscape and will take major chunk of some of this country ’s good agricultural land out of production do the secretary of state agree that it be vital that resident respond to the consultation that be currently go on and that national grid should be tell to take into consideration food security as well as energy security when it consider such application 
 i thank my hon friend for his question as he will know i can not comment on a specific proposal we need to rewire this country in order to have homegrown energy that mean host new infrastructure with the presumption that it be above ground and do in a way that minimise negative impact on food security which i be confident that any proposal that come forward will do let we make no mistake we must rewire this country we must power the uk more from this country clean up our energy and reduce our dependence on foreign fossil fuel 
 every single winter the village of altnaharra in sutherland be the cold community in the whole of the united kingdom some part of the united kingdom be cold than other that be geography may i ask that this fact be take into consideration when the government look at scheme to help people with the cost of pay their electricity bill 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question as he will know the government deliver over £ in support last winter we expect the warm home discount to support around household this winter with the final figure to be publish later since the warm home discount have deliver over £ in support for eligible low income household 
 i welcome the news that ofgem have put the price cap down by which represent a discount of about £ for every average home there be problem though the standing charge be still relatively high i know there be an open consultation but would the government consider transparency about the stand charge on bill so that the public understand exactly what it do 
 i thank my hon friend for his question clearly it be vital that we have the call for input on the standing charge and we await with anticipation how we will react to the over response that we have have so far 
 i have recently be inundate with correspondence follow the collapse of ssb law a legal firm that take thousand of defective cavity wall insulation case to court it have leave constituent with ten of thousand of pound in cost that they can not afford during an unprecedented cost of living crisis can the minister assure i that the government   have a plan to address this scandal what compensation will my constituent be offer to remove faulty cavity wall insulation so that they can finally be free of its devastating consequence 
 it be always awful to hear of these case i will write to the hon gentleman on the issue 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on international supply of military equipment and ammunition to ukraine 
 the uk have be lead international support for the armed force of ukraine for year since russia invade crimea in train more than new recruit since and commit almost £ in economic humanitarian and military aid since from the uk found uk administer international fund for ukraine which have pledge more than £ to spearhead capability coalition our effort have pave the way and make a genuine difference our nlaw anti tank missile and our javelins help brave ukrainians to devastate putin ’s menacing mile armoured convoy which be head for kyiv we be the to send main battle tank with our challenger squadron plus armoured vehicle and anti armour weapon 
 last week the defence secretary announce to this house a new package of brimstone anti tank missile plus £ for artillery munition the uk will also co lead an international capability coalition alongside latvia to supply cutting edge drone to ukraine in addition to the uk ’s co leadership of the international maritime capability coalition the defence secretary have urge partner and ally to commit to long term support for ukraine at the nato defence ministers meeting on   february the defence secretary and his counterpart from nato ally and sweden sign an agreement on new multinational procurement initiative focus on munition and missile spearhead by the uk these initiative aim to increase defence industrial capacity across the euro atlantic area replenish stockpile at pace and continue support to ukraine 
 i commend the government for their impressive record but do the minister accept that the equipment pledge by nato nation be not reach ukraine in anything like the amount promise do he accept for example that less than a of the shell promise by eu nation have arrive that more than artillery barrel will reach the end of their productive life this year that very few pilot be be train and that the ukrainians be perilously short of air defence this be at a time when the russians be on a war footing with of all their government spending gear towards the destruction of the ukrainian state 
 specifically may i ask whether defence intelligence and the government reckon that the ukrainians will be able to hold their current position and if so for how long when will artillery stock run even lower and fall off a cliff edge will the minister confirm that we have deliver on all our pledge i be in east ukraine last week do he understand that after the obliteration of the frontline town of avdiivka the ukrainians be now ask which of their town will be the next to be destroy by russian artillery while ukrainian soldier die because they lack kit finally do he accept that the situation be become acutely dangerous for everybody   with the force of fascism begin to overpower free state and their nato ally where do he believe we might be with security throughout europe in the next few month 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend and i pay tribute to he and all parliamentarian who have visit ukraine and show our solidarity and support for our ally i know that he have a background as an officer in the intelligence corps so he speak not only with the passion we all share but with significant expertise on these matter he will therefore be aware that there be a limit to what i can say on the operational situation and be draw into try to estimate the level of supply these be all sensitive and important point 
 i think we can all agree that what my hon friend say about air support and training be important i be at raf valley recently and as i understand it we be provide ukrainians with elementary fly training we be fly the f-16 and we have typhoon f-35s while other country will be provide the actual platform he be absolutely right to say that air defence be a critical part of the conflict and we need to supply more we have provide over air defence system but we want to do more 
 on the overall position as i have say we can not provide a running commentary on the exact operational situation but we provide regular tweet share what intelligence we can fundamentally my hon friend be right to warn all of we and indeed our ally of the risk be the situation to be reverse we can say with some certainty that when the war start we would all have be surprised to be in this situation with ukraine have win back so much territory and frankly remain in the fight that be thank in a huge part to the role of the united kingdom and we should be proud of that 
 as the secretary of state confirm in his recent oral statement we provide nlaw before russia invade and have be train ukrainians since 2014—60,000 in total but i know there be more to do my hon friend have a very good understanding of these matter these capability coalition on drone and the other on maritime be a good way to turn the support that have be provide into targeted and effective capability on the frontline we be clear that we need to do more and our ally need to stay with we in the fight 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as we mark year since vladimir putin ’s brutal illegal invasion begin it should be a source of pride to all in this house that the uk remain totally united and commit to support ukraine we must continue to stand with the ukrainian people for as long as it take for they to win 
 on military help for ukraine and on reinforce our nato ally the uk government have have and will continue to have labour ’s full support at yesterday ’s opening of the paris summit to shore up support for ukraine western leader rightly make it clear that russia be far from a spend force and that putin will not stop at ukraine if he win as russia step up its war effort we must step up our support and so must ukraine ’s other ally labour welcome the extra   brimstone anti tank missile and the £ artillery munition package for ukraine which the government announce this weekend 
 minister favour ad hoc announcement over a full military aid plan for ukraine but how can industry invest and mobilise with confidence without a long term plan to work against on step up western support for ukraine how be we co ordinating with our nato ally to ensure that our munition support provide ukraine with the urgent and sustained help it need of the £ announce for can the minister confirm how much be be spend on ukraine and how much be be spend on uk operational cost at nato basis 
 give the importance of the paris summit for ukraine why be the prime minister unable to attend the event unlike other key western leader there could be a change in government this year but there will be no change in britain ’s resolve to stand with ukraine to confront russian aggression and to pursue putin for his war crime 
 i be very grateful to the hon gentleman for continue to show solidarity for the consensus that exist across the house and in particular for specifically mention the brimstone gift and the £ recently announce for artillery munition 
 the hon gentleman talk about our long term plan just to be clear the war be happen today and the key focus of the £ for ukraine this financial year be get support into the country as soon as possible which be when they need it of course we want to have a long term plan too i be clear that the uk will play a very significant role in help ukraine when it be fully free to get back to the level of prosperity it expect for now we have to focus on what be a very challenging situation 
 drones be of the most important capability we have see in ukraine and they have arguably transform the nature of warfare in this conflict last week i be pleased to announce our own uncrewed strategy and in do so i talk about the malloy t150 drone which have do an incredible job lift blood munition and other key supply to ukrainian marine on the bank of the dnieper we have provide drone to ukraine and we will keep do that we have the £ yes it be about shell and munition but we also have to provide a way to fight with they we have to assist to ensure that we deliver that capability which be why those coalition be so important 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman support we in the round and we be send a message that this house be unite in support ukraine 
 i call the father of the house 
 the minister say the training start in which be the year after the house take in my view the wrong decision in the syria vote it lead to russia give help to assad the taking of crimea the infiltration of eastern ukraine and various other problem 
 as ukraine ’s security be in effect our security and that of our nato ally will he confirm that we will do all we can to try to make sure that ukraine be safe and that russia at some stage return to be a peaceful nation devote to the prosperity of its own people rather than do down other people 
 my hon friend make an excellent point and he be absolutely right to say that their security be our security we need to support ukraine because it be morally the right thing to do to support a free country that have be illegally invade we should also be clear that it be in our strategic interest and those of all of our democratic ally to do so because we do not want to see an emboldened russia not least because of the impact that could have on other potential adversary 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 ukraine be on the frontline not only of its own battle but of those of international democracy and law we can not leave the ukrainians without in a time of need their fight be our fight so let we look at what the uk government can do we must not allow putin ’s plan to wait until the international community lose interest to succeed will the uk government prepare an international criminal court case against russia for its bombardment of civilian in ukraine what more can the uk government do to ensure the safety of ukrainian sky and to ensure a united and collective western effort in continued support of ukraine 
 once again i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s support and that of the snp in ensure that we have this strong consensus across the house in support of the ukrainians as he say their fight be our fight i strongly agree he be also right about the icc as for where the ministry of defence be focus he make an important point about the threat in the air as i say air defence have be crucial but of course that fight take many form we need to look at not only ground to air system but drone which have proliferate and have an extraordinary impact we know that we can not provide the f-16 which be the ukrainians fighter of choice but we have do what we can by provide the elementary fly training and i absolutely assure he that we will do everything we can 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i welcome all that the government have be do include on brimstone and the package of £ worth of ammunition however may i ask specifically about mm shell and the bae systems production line have it now get the order to ensure that it be work at maximum capacity on a war footing to produce all it can to support ukraine and indeed in due course our own stockpile 
 it be a pleasure to take my contribution from my right hon friend in the chamber since he become chairman of the select committee i look forward to further discussion with he later this afternoon on other matter before the committee he be right to stress the importance of that contract—155 mm shell be of the fundamental munition we need   to see both replenish for the uk armed force and   where possible provide into ukraine along with other key artillery class i can confirm that we sign that contract with bae last july and it should lead to an eightfold increase in mm production initially in the washington plant but thereafter in south wales i be keen to see that get go as soon as possible 
 the mod have clearly do a decent job of support ukraine but i still doubt that the government as a whole be seize of the urgent critical nature of this crisis i return to the question i ask the secretary of state last week why when it be clear early in that this be go to be very much an artillery war date back to the last century do it take until mid-2023 to place the order for additional artillery shell the minister should have the answer by now 
 i refer to the previous answer i give where i be clear that we place that order last july as the right hon gentleman rightly say that be for our own armed force and it be an eightfold increase but we have provide artillery shell into ukraine we have procure they sir we have do that not just from this country we have do it through rapid procurement through defence equipment and support all i can say be that i pay tribute to that effort we all know that we need to go far the other point be that this be not just about what we have procure this country have play a lead role in ensure that other nation join we and provide more munition that be as much a key part of the role that we have play 
 last week in the nato parliamentary assembly joint session in brussels top military leader describe to we their concern that the eu ethical banking law be go to stop investment in arm company will my hon friend confirm that the uk will always ensure that the money need to invest in make sure that europe can protect itself against russian aggression will be there and that the arm can be manufacture
