 convention require that i say a few word about my predecessor and i have be advise that despite political difference these should be complimentary and civil i have try but the good that i can say be that the view of the last mp for woodstock belong to a different time which be quite understandable since lord randolph churchill hold it until the parliamentary borough of woodstock be abolish in for over a century woodstock disappear from the constituency name in this house meanwhile the town of bicester have never previously be name in a constituency bicester and woodstock be a fusion of previous constituency i therefore have no immediate predecessor to refer to but i want to thank robert courts john howell my hon friend   the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   and victoria prentis for their service to the community in my constituency like any new member i be eager to learn from how other have do thing so i be grateful to have such a diversity of approach to draw on 
 i be fortunate to be call on to ask a question in the prime minister ’s question time of this parliament i speak then about the river evenlode but i could equally have refer to the rivers cherwell dorn glyme or ray each cut a path through my constituency and each have to carry its unfair share of pollutant from thames water ’s sewage spill tackle the pollution of our river and waterway be a common concern among my constituent during the election campaign and i welcome the prime minister ’s undertaking to work across party to address this scandal

 another feature of my constituency be the rapid propose growth of town and village under plan adopt by the last government and support by conservative local council in bicester have already see tremendous growth a similar scale of development be plan for eynsham and the wide kidlington area include begbrooke and yarnton as this government prepare for an increase in housing provision the lesson from area like those in my constituency must be learn 
 my constituent understand the need for more home for local resident and especially for those who can not access social housing but they want to know that sufficient infrastructure will accompany new home i be talk about not just improvement to the hard engineering for travel grid connection sewage and other utility but also the social infrastructure of school gp surgery dispense chemist and nhs dentist as well as community youth and sport centre we must make sure that these service be fund and deliver before new home be release 
 i have live in the constituency for over year and my wife and i have raise our child there they attend local school and be active in local sport club long before i run for this election they ensure that i know the future constituency well by drag i to most of the sport ground and sport hall that it contain i owe my place to the many voter who put i here but i would not be here without the steadfast support of my family and i be so pleased that they be here today for some that support have come with encouragement for other it come with occasional embarrassment about my endeavour but from all it have come with love affection and a willingness to keep i ground through the occasional well deserve put down i be truly grateful to they and hope that they know how much i appreciate their support 
 my constituency contain a vibrant mix of community beyond its town famously kidlington contend to be the large village in england with its population of over when the parish council suggest in that it be a town irate resident force it to back down and reinstate village status that do not however explain why group of chinese harry potter fan be spot take photo outside suburban home in the village in despite extensive search i never find the dursleys of privet drive on the electoral roll 
 of the great pleasure of represent this area be travel across its stunning countryside and discover the passion for history environment and community that burn in each town and village i can not do justice to that diversity today but i say thank you to the thousand of constituent who contribute to their community as town and parish councillor school governor village fête organiser wildlife champion royal british legion fundraiser youth sport coach   or food bank collector and in many other role besides every week as i visit organisation in the constituency i be inspire by the selfless action of those who put community and build strong relationship freely give hour at a time 
 it be that sense of community and of what we can do for each other that bring i here today from volunteer as a school governor i come to see how both the setting and implementation of national policy have deep local impact i become a county councillor in and see up close how local government have be hollow out by national funding decision that respect neither the role that local authority play in deliver critical service nor the unique insight they hold at local level about the need of their resident those experience put i on the path towards stand for election and it be a huge honour now to be a member of this house i hope that during my time here i can serve my community with the same selflessness and energy show by so many of my constituent

 if it be not about make people ’s live well do not be a politician 
 rochdale certainly have a long history of make people ’s live well and of strong link to this palace of westminster indeed it be a rochdale lass year old emily kelsall who in lay the foundation stone of the elizabeth tower that house big ben the kelsalls be close friend of another of my predecessor the great parliamentarian richard cobden and his ally john bright who famously describe england as the mother of parliaments 
 cobden and bright a rochdalian by adoption and a rochdalian by birth be rochdale radical who campaign as vigorously against slavery as they do for cheap food through the abolition of the corn law and for a wide franchise another rochdalian who be friend with cobden and bright be the lancashire dialect poet edwin waugh after whom my young son eddie who be in the gallery be name waugh capture the beauty of the 
 hill and hillock knoll and dell 
 and the moor and brook of my pennine constituency from blackstone edge to hollingworth lake from healey dell to the landscape garden of our magnificent town hall there be greenery and beauty throughout our town and its village of littleborough wardle milnrow and newhey 
 the pennine way cut through my seat yet our pennine way be more than just the well love footpath it be a way of do thing too our pennine way be of community   co operation self help and resilience ever since the rochdale pioneers set up shop in to sell affordable basic like butter sugar and flour we have be proud to be the birthplace of a global co operative moment and i be proud to be the labour and co operative mp in our town ’s history 
 that sense of co operation and community have be enhance by the current of migration that have flow through our town as steadily as the river roch itself scot like my own waugh clan the irish italians ukrainians poles pakistanis kashmiris bangladeshis nigerians we even welcome the occasional yorkshireman have all staff our factory and our nhs and create new family business all be proud rochdalians just as our town have show real resilience in the face of economic downturn and government cut our community cohesion have prove resilient too despite the provocation of extremist on all side 
 as well as radicalism and resilience our town ’s story be a story of renewal many of our mill have close but there be still a strong sense of industry of hard work of grafter of entrepreneur of people who put something back into the town that raise they there be people like richard tang whose zen internet start as a small home base business but be now a major network provider and our big private sector employer there be people like sir peter ogden who found computacenter and this year invest million into my beloved rochdale afc up the dale in recognition of its role as a hub of our community 
 from the brass band of milnrow to the rock and folk music of feel good festival our art be thrive too rochdale form college be of the high achieving in the country our armed force veteran support group be superb springhill hospice be a beacon of excellence and the oasis ward at rochdale infirmary be a national model in dementia care 
 my own journey from rochdale to this place be make possible only by an enable state a fantastic teacher john williams who spot the potential in i and my twin brother mark a council house that give i the stability and affordability that many family sadly lack today and free school meal that mean we could focus on learn not earn as a former chairman of the lobby it would be remiss of i not to also mention the role that my parliamentary journalism have play in propel i on to these benches and i would like to dispel the vicious rumour that the main reason i stand for parliament be to guarantee more year of jerk chicken 
 the phrase westminster village be often use as an insult but this place really be a village in the good sense of the word a community of more than people from all walk of life make sure that this be an open and accessible people ’s house not the preserve of an elite for year i have have the pleasure of work in this building with its fabulous canteen staff like betty rita daphne terry and godfrey the doorkeepers like adrian the security staff like saeed the many clerks and official and of course the police i will never forget the day when we lose our own village policeman pc keith palmer in the terror attack of it have be my pleasure to work with my lobby colleague and with mps of all party and i would like to reassure all the tory leadership contender do not worry your secret be safe with i 
 politician and journalist have more in common than either would like to admit at their good both be honourable trade and they be trade they be not profession but the big difference between we be the difference between criticism and action between commentary and do in the end i could no long just write about the appalling state of our public service i want to do something about it i want to do something about the nhs worker like my wife who come home every night exhaust by a sheer lack of staff i want to do something about all those work class kid like i whose destiny be still too often determine by their postcode not by their potential 
 i also want to do something about this misinformation age that we live in and to combat the rise of extremism that disfigure too much of our discourse it be stanley baldwin who denounce the newspaper baron for want power without responsibility today too many social medium company have exactly that this summer ’s spread of online hate and falsehood be a challenge to which this government will have to rise just as they rise to the challenge of crack down on the thug who attack our community and our brave police officer tackle online publisher that be what they be publisher not platform may sound radical but in reality radicalism be often just common sense ahead of its time a reminder that all our right be hard won what could be more commonsensical than demand that the vote be give to the working class and to woman more than year ago what could be more commonsensical than this railway bill give the public control over the service that spend billion of pound of their own money what could be more commonsensical than tackle climate change or give town like rochdale more control over their own future town that do not want a handout but deserve a fair share of the national resource 
 the pennines be famously the backbone of england but the people of rochdale be the backbone of england too common sense radicalism resilience and renewal those be the watchword of my home town of this country and of this government and i will do my utmost to live up to they 
 thank you madam chair for allow i to catch your eye during this very important debate i congratulate   the hon member for rochdale paul waugh   on a really excellent maiden speech and i hope that i can match the very high bar that have be set by hon member in all part of the house so far today 
 i start by pay tribute to my predecessor sir greg knight i be very fortunate to be follow he he be a very well like and respected member of this house his parliamentary career span decade and he serve as a minister in the government of thatcher major and cameron he be the member for derby north from to and excel in the role of deputy chief whip and minister for industry he then return to this place in for the then   constituency of east yorkshire which have now become bridlington and the wolds and be re elect on separate occasion until his retirement this year 
 sir greg serve for a stint in the whips office during the coalition year and work tirelessly behind the scene on many of parliament ’s less fashionable committee i will always aspire to match his dedication and integrity in public life but there be area in which i will never be able to compete with he that be of course the election campaign jingle for any hon member who be unaware of his unique impact in this area i wholeheartedly recommend a quick internet search after today ’s debate more seriously sir greg be rightly reward with a knighthood for his service to this place and i place on record my thank for his support and friendship in recent month i wish both he and lady janet a very happy and well deserve retirement 
 i now have the unbelievable privilege of represent my home constituency of bridlington and the wolds and it be truly the great honour of my life i be sure you will agree madam chair that there be no fine county than yorkshire and nowhere showcase it well than the east riding from the stunning cliff and world famous seabird colony at bempton and flamborough head to the golden sandy beach stretch from bridlington to hornsea and the roll hill and picture book village of the wolds 
 each of the town in the constituency have its own unique appeal bridlington be the large shellfish land port in the uk and the lobster capital of europe it attract million of visitor every year and be home to many thousand of people who have retire to the area and i will always fiercely defend our local pensioner driffield my home town be the capital of the wolds or capital of the world as i think it say on the road sign as a child and home to of the large day agricultural show in the country hornsea boast not only a beautiful coastline but the large freshwater lake in yorkshire and market weighton be once home to william bradley who be believe to be the tall person ever to have live in this country at foot inch tall and to whom the town pay tribute every year on giant bradley day i do not wish to test your patience madam chair by sing the praise of all the many village and hamlet across my constituency but it would be remiss of i not to mention nafferton where i grow up and wansford where i now live both be home to excellent local pub if you do find yourself in the area i would be delighted to buy you a drink

 i return to the topic of today ’s debate privatisation of the railway be necessary because british rail be not work either for rail user or the british taxpayer   however the process of privatise rail operator have not be perfect in part because franchise operate monopoly in that respect they be no different from the nationalise service that they replace however where genuine competition exist rail privatisation have be a success on the east coast main line the government subsidise franchise london north eastern railway compete with open access operator hull train grand central and lumo that have lead to cheap price for user high satisfaction and great punctuality and inter city service have be extend to new town and city across yorkshire and the north east of those operator hull train now run direct service a day between beverley and london and i would love to see they extend to bridlington and driffield just up the line in my constituency 
 however the legislation put those efficient non subsidised open access operator under threat instead of learn the lesson of those success story and expand they across the network the government be slide back to a nostalgic vision of the 1970 even though public service be in fact inefficient and expensive for rail user and the public purse the legislation ’s failure to provide specific guarantee to open access operator will mean that there be no incentive for they to invest in new rolling stock or expand their service we need more open access not less 
 minister claim that there be a continued role for open access operator where they add value and capacity to the network but they will soon be at the mercy of an entirely nationalise infrastructure and provider do ministers not realise that a reborn british rail will work for passenger only if its inter city service face stiff open access competition across the network the east coast main line be a mature and successful test case and it should be expand otherwise what incentive will there be for a new british rail to deliver cheap and well service none i suspect the legislation be as rush as it be ideological the only loser will be rail user and the taxpayer 
 i express my gratitude to you ms cummins for the chance to address the house for the time i congratulate all hon member who have deliver their maiden speech in recent day their eloquence serve as testament to the remarkable talent in this house and i be honour to be count among they i eagerly anticipate their contribution to future debate in the year ahead i also pay tribute to my immediate predecessor jason mccartney who have demonstrate over the past and a half year a real passion for improve the life of many people in the constituency

 however as i suggest early focus beyond our immediate need can be challenging when we be tired lonely hungry distracted or simply busy too many of our people be in that position they find it impossible to get off the treadmill of look to make end meet as the member for colne valley i aspire to be a voice for those who struggle to be hear amid the pressure of   the cost of living challenge they face i aim to be a calm consistent advocate for all emphasise the strength that come from unity and a voice that celebrate the selflessness of those whose altruism form the bedrock of a healthy society however i also recognise the importance of be a strong resilient voice that call for well and more effective way of build and retain wealth in our community to benefit everyone my value stem from the collective and my unwavering commitment lie with my community those be the value and principle i will carry with i every day as i go to work in this place for the people of colne valley 
 thank you madam chair i be delighted to make my maiden speech today as the mp for the new constituency of dunfermline and dollar it be a privilege to follow   the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller and i would like to congratulate all mp who have make such fantastic and powerful maiden speech this afternoon with such a high turnover of mp the calibre of the speech i have hear since the election should give everyone a sense of optimism about the future and what this parliament can achieve 
 i believe i must start my speech with a particular tribute and so i shall they be know for be colourful and preen strut around like they own the place and expect to be wait on hand and foot by a fantastic team of underpaid and overworked staff they demand honour and they disappear without permission whenever the mood take they in the past century their name have include andrew malcolm and angus and i be even tell that some individual have be find in bush in a horrible state no these be not my honourable predecessor they be not even member of the other place instead they be the name of just some of the peacock that reside in the beautiful surrounding of the pittencrieff park in dunfermline and that only last week be award the freedom of the city 
 i be sure that my immediate predecessor for the seat that now make up the constituency of dunfermline and dollar will not object to be upstage by the peacock but i would like to place on record my thank to both douglas chapman the member for dunfermline and west fife from until retire prior to the election and john nicolson the member for ochil and south perthshire douglas and john work hard on behalf of their constituent in the good and true tradition of public service and i wish they well 
 i would also like to thank my immediate predecessor from the labour party thomas docherty thomas be still know by many in this house and we should   remain grateful to he for propose the idea of recall mp although i suspect that gratitude be perhaps feel by i and some of my colleague rather than by some of the members opposite 
 my aww dad sense of humour be something i be accuse of have long before i have child and where well than a debate on railway to put some of that reputation to the test so i will steam ahead with my remark and do my utmost to stay on track hop to reach my destination on time and not come up against the buffer of your patience madam chair 
 i have never serve in the armed force but i be raise in a family that do much of the sense of public service that i hope to bring to my contribution to this house be root in the value of the member of my family who have do so my grandma margaret delworth be a plotter for the raf during the battle of britain with the air raid siren next to she play a part in the deafness she suffer later in life my grandpa serve in the royal signals in campaign in north africa italy include at monte cassino and later with the un in korea my parent jim and cathy be both member of the royal observer corps indeed that be where they meet and i be very proud that they be in the public gallery today 
 when i be my parent take what i now realise must have be an incredibly brave decision to move our family to berlin where we live on raf gatow for and a half year many of my early memory be from there and it have shape the rest of my life i play football with fc westend a german club base nearby the death of rudolf hess be historic but mean i get a day off school and the defection of a soviet general see my sister lock in the cellar of an air traffic control tower for hour helen have always be a very supportive old sister but i would be lie if i say that there have not be time when i wish she have be leave there just a little long 
 but it be an early november morning in that truly shape my politic i be wake at am by my dad who sit i down in front of a german tv channel and proclaim this be history i watch as ten of thousand of people scale the berlin wall herald the beginning of the end of the cold war and move towards a united germany the event of teach i that oppression be not can not and never will be either acceptable or effective and neither should it be tolerate 
 i want to take this opportunity to add to the sentiment across this house that the uk will stand with ukraine for as long as it take to fight the aggression of vladimir putin he might hold the honorific of president but a dictator be a dictator as many before have warn from these benches 
 it be that history that privilege of observe good triumphing that make i immensely proud to be serve the constituency of dunfermline and dollar the area have a proud military history and with the royal navy base hms caledonia that continue to this day the firth of forth be a regular home to the grand fleet and throughout the and century the ship and sailor that protect we then and continue today have call that part of west fife their home 
 this allow i to mention rachel squire who some might remember be the member of parliament for dunfermline and west fife before her sad death in   she lead the successful battle to save the dockyard at rosyth which remain a vital and major asset to the local economy and our community i visit the dockyard just last week to see the progress on the construction of the type frigate and be impress by the talented and dedicated workforce who build and maintain the warship that keep our country safe as the world continue to look to britain for leadership and security we must never forget the community and worker who be the backbone of a deterrent and strength that so many depend on 
 i be afraid i will now return to the bad pun as we ride the rail again from rosyth to dunfermline scotland ’s ancient capital close to pittencrieff park and the preen peacock we find dunfermline abbey the rest place of scotland ’s king and queen include robert the bruce and the birthplace of charles i. close by be the birthplace of andrew carnegie the great scottish businessman and philanthropist who value and promote industry innovation and education with a global view of scotland and the uk his legacy of library and education be strongly feel in dunfermline and around the world and nowhere more so than in the united states in institution such as carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh however a local historian tell i that after andrew ’s death his widow employ a certain mary anne macleod as a domestic servant in her home in new york answer on a red baseball cap for why i might not want to dwell on that connection too much 
 as i continue my journey poor rural transport sadly mean that a replacement bus service be require as i take we to dollar a beautiful village at the foot of the ochil hill i hold an excellent surgery there this weekend and i be very tempt to return this weekend for the village ’s annual beer festival i note that beer have be a theme in many of the maiden speech we have hear since the election dollar be most famous for dollar academy and despite cordial disagreement over certain aspect of the labour party manifesto i be very grateful for the excellent work it do with the local community and school in the area to share its learning and experience 
 travel back towards dunfermline we will find the railway track once again these track transport coal from the mine in nearby village such as oakley comrie valleyfield saline and steelend and be more recently use by the former longannet coal power station near kincardine as the member for a constituency with a proud history of mining i be delighted to stand on a manifesto that will end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme 
 at this point i will mention just more of my predecessor gordon brown who be elect as the member for dunfermline east in in prepare my speech today i read his incredible contribution to this house i urge other to do the same as it be a powerful speech focus on the need to tackle unemployment with this new labour government invest in green job manufacturing and infrastructure we will have the opportunity to make the constituency of dunfermline and dollar and site such as longannet driver of the fife scottish and uk economy once again tackle unemployment by establish new industry and expertise that will help the global fight against climate change 
 i begin this speech by talk about the contribution of family and my optimism for the future and i will begin wind up in the same vein i want to take a moment to thank my wife jen it be very simple without her love and support i would not be stand here today we have hear about the importance of family in maiden speech from member from all part of the house all member of this house will be aim to make even the small contribution to create a well community a well country and a well world for our own family and future generation i want my daughter hannah and eilidh and all child regardless of where and how they start their life to be able to grow up in a world where the opportunity exist for their own aspiration and ambition to be meet nurture support and fulfil that be something we have hear powerfully in speech this afternoon as the dunfermline bear author iain banks write 
 the future remain malleable and retain the possibility of change 
 those be wise word that i will try to remember as i work across the house to create that well future 
 it be a pleasure to follow the maiden speech of   the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie i be especially interested in his recollection of the fall of the berlin wall in which be also of my early political memory although i be obviously on the other side of the house as a result i be interested in his reference to monte cassino which might make sense later on in my speech 
 i be incredibly grateful to the people of south west devon who put their trust in i on   july elect i to serve they here in parliament start out in this place just a few short week ago it be almost a quarter of a century to the day since i set foot in parliament forgive the cliché but if someone have tell the year old i who be spend a week ’s work experience with the mp for south west devon sir gary streeter that day i would follow in his actual footstep i would not have believe they everybody i have meet since enter this place who know my predecessor tell i that i have big shoe to fill for some that might seem daunt after all he be a size and i be a mere size however know sir gary as i do in fact have know he since we meet at a kylie minogue concert in where we both enjoy her rendition of the loco motion”—i be honour to follow in his footstep and the legacy he have leave 
 after year as a member of parliament sir gary ’s legacy be of kindness integrity and a deep commitment to the people of south west devon i know that there be member on both side of the house past and present who appreciate his wisdom over the year it be something that he will tell you come from his deep christian faith i be grateful that i still have access to that wisdom give that he be now of my constituent and that i also share his faith 
 unsurprisingly although sir gary achieve a huge amount for our constituent there be issue affect south west devon today long term battle that he fight and that remain in need of a victory such   issue relate to our great western railway line through devon today ’s debate therefore provide the perfect opportunity to commit myself to the fight for a well railway service to the far reach of devon and the south west 
 follow the devastating flood at dawlish in the previous government do much to safeguard the line through devon the sight of a railway track suspend in mid air with nothing between it and the sea be not easily forget i will therefore be campaign cross party alongside colleague to see the new government commit to complete the remedial work at dawlish they must also ensure that forthcoming hs2 work at old oak common in london do not hamper the progress make on our journey time between london and the south west the main line through devon do not just take holidaymaker to our beautiful county it be vital for those who live and work there too 
 the west side of plymouth be serve effectively by several small station but to the east in my constituency there be very few option for train travel between plymouth and totnes some minute away indeed the current level of service make a mockery of the exist park and ride by train that be advertise as people drive down the a38 i will therefore continue to fight for crosscountry train not just great western railway service to call at ivybridge station as the population of that town and of nearby sherford grow have adequate access to mainline train service close than plymouth totnes or in some case tiverton parkway be essential 
 to see the full economic benefit of the plymouth and south devon freeport with its key site at langage and sherford we must see the delivery of a metro railway link plymouth with tavistock and ivybridge include a stop in plympton that would also enhance connectivity for the dartmoor village which be now a welcome part of south west devon follow the recent parliamentary boundary change the previous government ’s plan to reopen the line between plymouth and tavistock be critical to deliver that metro service i therefore call on the new government to push forward with that proposal and enable we to get the metro scheme off the ground 
 i can only hope that the new government be as commit to support those much need improvement in south west devon as they be to the new legislation that we be hastily debate today a bill that seem to indicate ideological time travel back to the nationalise railway system of the past and a mistaken belief that state run institution be the answer to all our woe our railway system need to drive forward into the middle of the century not creep backwards to the 1970 in the case of south west devon that mean the difference between reach our full potential and miss the mark 
 i would waste the opportunity to extol the virtue of south west devon far if i leave thing there yes transport be a big issue locally whether that be about the need for a bus route between plymstock and plympton cycle path in the south hams that do not require mountaineering experience to navigate or improve junction on and off the a38 at lee mill but i hope i will be allow just a few moment to introduce hon member more fully to south west devon 
 south west devon have to be of the most unique constituency in the country i challenge hon member to name another constituency anywhere with our combination of urban and rural moorland and coastal community it combine the city suburb of plymouth the ancient stannary town of plympton and plymstock with its rich maritime history with the rural south hams and dartmoor national park we have the thriving town of ivybridge the inland and coastal village and farm of the south hams the historic country estate of flete and maristow the village on the edge of the tamar valley and rugge dartmoor farm and village south west devon be home to the new town of sherford the soon to expand community of woolwell and royal marines commando at bickleigh barrack there be so much history so much beauty and so many wonderful and unique community indeed too many to list here and be finish by the adjournment hon member will be pleased to hear 
 life have deal i experience that have turn into passion that i be determined to build on here in parliament i have spend the last year work for the commonwealth war graves commission hence the comment on monte cassino from travel around the south west share the story of the man and woman of the commonwealth whom the commission commemorate across the world i have develop a lifelong passion for this wonderful organisation and the importance of keep alive the story of those who fall i know that all hon member have recently hear from the commission about those commemorate in their constituency and i encourage they to get in touch with their regional public engagement co ordinator if they would like to know more 
 when i be grow up my parent who be in the gallery today offer up their home as foster parent that experience have leave i with a deep interest in the care system and how we enable care experience young people to have the future they deserve while there be those in this place with far more experience in the field than i my interest span over decade and i be determined to be a voice for those young people 
 finally have start my elect career in local government i bring with i experience of a range of issue include work to tackle violence against woman and girl enable woman and girl to feel safe and be safe in their community and in my community in south west devon be a long term challenge yet have chair the plymouth violence against woman and girl commission and see the cross party determination to deliver on it in this place i believe that we will see the societal change that we fight for 
 in plymouth which make up a significant proportion of my constituency and be my home city see its member of parliament nancy astor become the female to take a seat in the house of commons since then a female mp have represent at least a part of plymouth for all but year the long gap in female mps be from to i be delighted to have bring an end to the drought pick up the baton of plymouth ’s former female mps and also become the woman in south west devon nancy astor herself say in her maiden speech just over year ago 
 hon member should not be frightened of what plymouth send out into the world after all i suppose when drake and raleigh want to set out on their venturesome career some cautious   person say do not do it it have never be try before but on the whole the world be all the well for those venturesome and courageous west country people and i would like to say that i be quite certain that the woman of the whole world will not forget that it be the fight man of devon who dare to send the woman to represent woman in the mother of parliaments ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 fortunately i be venture out from plymouth in the well wear footstep of the woman and man who have go before i buoy by the courage of the people of south west devon man and woman who vote to send i to this the mother of all parliaments to fight for they and our special part of devon 
 thank you madam chair it be a real honour and privilege to be able to make my maiden speech today as the house debate the role of our railway before i continue i must give credit to all those who have give their maiden speech today it be quite a daunting prospect to follow they all i must comment on a few of the amazing journey that have bring people here i think of my hon friend   the member for sheffield central abtisam mohamed   and   the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood it be quite inspiring to hear their story i must also comment on the speech of   the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith as we be mutual friend of sir gary streeter it must have be quite a sight to see he do the loco motion all those year ago 
 it be of special importance to i to talk in the debate today on the role of our railway the east coast main line go right through my constituency in fact i think about half of it do because we be the large constituency in england with station in morpeth alnmouth and berwick today we be debate the government ’s plan over time to put the railway back into public ownership or as some might say into public service that be really what i want to address today the idea and ideal of public service all of we be here to serve the public but we can only serve here because of the people who have go before we the people who support we and of course the people who vote for we so my thank must go to the people of north northumberland include those who vote labour for the time indeed whether they vote for i or not i will serve they to the good of my ability 
 my thank also go to my family and foremost my wife daughter and son who be my bedrock and whose patience with i be frankly astonishing but also to the generation that have go before when i think about public service i think of my grandparent world war generation we have already hear about monte cassino a couple of time well my grandfather fight   at monte cassino el alamein and elsewhere and it would have be beyond his wild dream that his grandson would day be stand here 
 speak of those who have go before in public service i must recognise the great work of my predecessor as member of parliament for what be now north northumberland those political pea in a pod the right hon former member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan and my hon friend   the former member for wansbeck now the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery as a former miner and engineer my hon friend will have a great interest in the success of the railway and he have also serve his constituent with great distinction and tenacity for many year now anne marie trevelyan ’s public service include many significant role in government include secretary of state for transport and i would like to thank she for her graciousness in the handover of the constituency casework i must also mention lord beith although he retire from this place in he be still hold in very high regard in northumberland for his nearly year of service if i can earn just a small portion of the respect that he garner i will consider myself fortunate 
 so now i pick up the baton and i confess that of the thing i check with a name as distinctive as my own be whether i be the only david smith mp elect on   july imagine my surprise and disappointment then when on the follow day i receive a congratulatory email from a labour member of parliament call david smith thankfully that particular david smith mp be a member of the australian parliament i be for now at least the only david smith in this place 
 it be a convention for member to try and mention every settlement in their constituency when give their maiden speech i have mention that mine be the large in england so that may be a challenge it be also traditional for member of this place to make compete claim about how theirs be the most beautiful constituency in the land so i be pleased to be able to put that debate to bed surely it be a certainty that the land of bamburgh and warkworth castle of druridge bay and holy island of rothbury wooler and the cheviot hill and of the historic county town of berwick alnwick and morpeth be the most beautiful in england the number of member who have holiday in my constituency seem to confirm my conclusion i be sure that those who have travel on the east coast main line through my constituency along our magnificent coastline will do so again 
 north northumberland be not only beautiful but have produce and give a home to some of the most notable public servant in british history who can look past the role that northumberland play in the establishment of early british christianity the northumbrian saint especially cuthbert and aidan be renowned for their faith wisdom compassion and miracle even if today at least accord to my daughter the most famous north northumberland resident with magical power be a certain mr harry potter 
 emily wilding davison the suffragette from morpeth be another north northumbrian who fight for what be right emily famously hide herself in a broom cupboard here in parliament on the night of the census so that she could record her address as the house of   commons to confound those who would deny woman the right to vote i be delighted to follow in her footstep and those of william beveridge the mp for berwick upon tweed who author the eponymous beveridge report which serve as the basis for that great innovation the welfare state introduce by the labour government in what would so many of we do without it 
 north northumberland be also home to vibrant and hard work community that serve in their own way whether it be those in the fishery of amble and seahouses the farmer work the land across the constituency from alwinton to norham to keep we feed or the serviceman and woman at raf boulmer who protect the uk ’s airspace the people of north northumberland rightly take great pride in the work of their hand in the county that they call home and in the contribution that they make to the common good nowhere be that more true than in the grand town of berwick upon tweed with its historic wall and majestic bridge of which the royal border bridge serve the east coast main line my particular favourite though be the union chain bridge for all that it represent for the union between scotland and england we truly have cross border life in north northumberland today we have a choice to build either wall or bridge across that border and i choose to be a bridge builder 
 the truth be that when it come to transport infrastructure and even public service we have a choice will we use it for private benefit or for the common good for i the common good must be paramount we be of equal value by virtue of our humanity but not all of we have the same opportunity the same start in life or the same challenge to overcome many community in my constituency feel left behind and many feel out of sight and out of mind see the humanity in each other be a proactive choice at time over the summer some people in our country choose to ignore the humanity of other with terrible consequence 
 of the most famous piece of literature in our country ’s history a national treasure come from my constituency the lindisfarne gospel how good it would be if they could return home to holy island day perhaps on the east coast main line as beautiful as their calligraphy be to i their primary value come in the wisdom they contain and the story they tell as i set out on the task of be a member of parliament my thought turn to the wisdom of another part of the good book proverb chapter say 
 speak up for those who can not speak for themselves for the right of all who be destitute 
 speak up and judge fairly defend the right of the poor and needy 
 those be wise word for all with a heart for public service especially those of we who call ourselves parliamentarian as for i they will be the axiom by which i expect my public service to be judge however long i remain in this place 
 as a lifelong trade unionist who have spend the last year championing bring public service back from the private sector this debate be understandably close to my heart i congratulate all the other new member   who have make their maiden speech today they have show passion and reason for be here i very much appreciate the comment make by my hon friend   the member for north northumberland david smith   for reason that may become apparent 
 it be a great honour to be the member of parliament for the new constituency of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch my thank to the people of the community that make up the constituency for place their trust in i i pay tribute to my immediate predecessor stuart c. mcdonald who be mp for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east for the last year it be appropriate that i be make my maiden speech as the ballot for private member bills take place in the lobby because the progression into law of his private member ’s bill protect the right of parent of premature baby show that we can all make a difference when we work together in the house 
 as stuart c. mcdonald say in his maiden speech the former member for glasgow south be also call stewart mcdonald and there continue to be significant confusion many member may not be aware well my hon friend   the member for west dunbartonshire douglas mcallister   will know that there be a far complicate factor locally in that east dunbartonshire council ’s kirkintilloch east and north and twechar ward be very ably represent by councillor stewart macdonald i thank all of they for the commitment that they have show to their community 
 i wish to thank a further predecessor rosemary mckenna she serve initially as member for cumbernauld and kilsyth then as member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east from to when i be a young woman activist in the scottish labour party rosemary be of the big influence on i that eventually bring i to this place she be of the people who sit i down and say maybe just think about stand 
 the new constituency of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch run from the boundary of glasgow in millerston to the boundary with falkirk at castlecary and be bisect by the m80 motorway it be serve by croy station on the main glasgow to edinburgh express railway line with stepps greenfaulds and cumbernauld be on the local line from glasgow rail service be vital in a constituency where people travel to work 
 cumbernauld be designate a new town in but it have a very rich history it include cumbernauld village and its weaver and condorrat and the rich farmland between the campsie hill to the north and the luggie water to the south there have be settlement there since before roman time the northern boundary of roman britain the antonine wall run through the constituency the bar hill fort garrison by people from across ancient europe and the middle east establish to protect the wall be still accessible from twechar 
 evidence of the mining history of the constituency remain strong there be the kilsyth victoria cottage hospital of the place in the constituency where i go to work the remnant of the miner row which be now farm outhouse and the vast swathe of new housing build on former colliery land in cardowan chryston kilsyth and twechar 
 it would take a far braver woman than i to make comment about football in the week lead up to or follow an old firm game cumbernauld ’ most famous outing on film be in the ’s bill forsyth classic gregory ’s girl for those who be not familiar with the film it centre around a school football team who experience a significant improvement in form when of the girl dorothy turn up for the trial and subsequently play up front as a striker this film be a firm murray family favourite our house be burgle when i be quite young and the young member of the murray family be probably more upset that the gregory ’s girl video be in the recorder that have be steal so it be poetic that of scotland ’s big woman ’s team rangers women play all their home match in broadwood in cumbernauld i be sure that i can pass on the good wish of probably most in this house for when the team face arsenal ’s woman ’s team in the semi final of the qualifying round of the champions league tomorrow 
 as i have say of the big selling point of the constituency be its connectivity to scotland ’s central belt city if there be to be that connectivity we need a proper integrated public transport system base on public need rather than on the most profitable route no matter which part of the constituency i be in what people want to talk to i about most be public transport whether it be an amend railway timetable that mean that there be no service after be on a sunday or a bus service that get cancel because there be no cover to allow the driver to take a break during the summer holiday the youth group at twechar healthy living and enterprise centre plan a day trip to millport use the bus service it involve multiple bus and ferry but it require phone around to get lift back to the village for the last leg of the journey as the twechar bus stop run at pm 
 like most of we i have spend more time than be healthy consider the basis of my politic and value benefit of make my speech later on be that i have be able to listen to the maiden speech of so many other member when   the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper   make his maiden speech he speak about galloway dairy farm which be important to i because i immediately think of my grandmother she grow up on of those farm the old daughter of the dairyman she be bright she pass she plus and be entitle to a place at the grammar school but in the 1920 dairyman ’s daughter do not go to grammar school certainly not if they be the eld and they have young sibling she never forget that and among her child grandchild and great grandchild there be an expectation that we would take all the educational chance open to we and fight for they when they be not obvious we be expect to stick in at school go to university and when we have get our qualification embrace a life of service 
 i be proud to come from a family of teacher doctor civil servant health worker school staff and social care staff i be also proud of the fact that my parent be here today we be support in challenge thing that be not fair and stand up for ourselves it be probably no surprise that i end up a trade unionist in the health service fight for public service and never shut up 
 for the whole of my work life i have work in partnership and try to build alliance between worker and between community many of the community of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch be at a point of transition it be in a spirit of partnership and alliance that i will work to strengthen the bond that bind our people together i will work in this place and in cumbernauld and kirkintilloch to confront the challenge that we face around those point of transition and to ensure that what unite we guide we this afternoon we have hear from across the house all the point that unite we let we focus not on difference but on area of agreement because we cross path far more often than we cross sword 
 i wish to start by thank my hon friend   the member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray   on her witty and passionate speech her commitment to public service and her drive to improve the life of her constituent shine through i would also like to compliment all those who have give their maiden speech today the standard have be exceptional what an honour it be to speak after so many inspiring colleague and what an honour it be to give my speech in this chamber during a debate on the future of our railway so many of my constituent depend on mill hill broadway and hendon station and this bill bring the railway back into public ownership place passenger at the heart of our rail system and ensure value for money for the taxpayer will make a real difference to they get the management of our railway and the number underpin they on a sound foot be crucial 
 i think i can justifiably claim to have a strong personal understanding of just how important it be to get your number exactly right because madam chair if you ask i to think of a number i do not need to ponder long my lucky number be why because be the size of my majority i have the honour of hold the small majority in parliament it remind i every day who send i here who i serve in this place how grateful i be to the people who vote for i and how life turn on the very small of margin so i pledge now to serve the people of hendon no matter how they vote with every fibre of my being 
 small margin run as a theme in our family be the anniversary of my father be smuggle out of the munkács ghetto in what be today ukraine in april my infant father be herd along with the rest of the jewish population of the town and surround countryside into the crowd squalid ghetto with thousand jam into barely more than a handful of city block but on   may a christian woman pretend to be his mother spirit he out just day before over people include unfortunately many member of my own family be put on train to auschwitz never to return small margin madam chair small margin and the kindness of stranger
