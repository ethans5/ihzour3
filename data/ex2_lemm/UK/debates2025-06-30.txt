 the hon gentleman raise an important point which be precisely what we want to look at in the pip review because it do not take into account fluctuating condition that be an important issue move forward and we will be absolutely determined to involve he his constituent and organisation that represent those with fluctuate condition in the process of the review 
 because pip be not an in work benefit 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to improve housing for armed force family 
 what step he be take to improve housing for armed force family 
 with your indulgence mr speaker on behalf of those serve in our armed force i would like to thank you for the parliamentary flag raise ceremony to mark the start of armed forces week last monday i thank hon member across the house for the support that they give to more than local armed forces day event over the weekend 
 on housing we be a government who be deliver for defence in january we buy back military home into public ownership in april we launch a consumer charter to deliver basic housing right and standard in may we announce an additional £ for force family home part of £ that we will invest in military accommodation in the next year 
 i meet serviceman servicewoman and veteran in my constituency at event such as remembrance day and the recent ve commemoration we all know the challenge that servicemen and woman have have with housing and its quality in recent year do my right hon friend agree that it be this labour government who be finally make they proud 
 indeed i pay tribute to my hon friend for his strong work link with veteran in watford he be right as he will recognise my hon friend the minister for veterans and people recently launch operation valour the ever uk wide approach to veteran support with £ of funding to establish a new network of valour recognise support centre right across the country 
 this saturday hundred will join to mark falkirk armed forces day in callendar park belatedly many of those who be currently serve and veteran in scotland rely on the activity of charitable organisation such as the ancre somme association which be host the event and veterans housing scotland which provide affordable housing for those who have serve do the government have any plan to supplement the essential and welcome £ additional investment for service housing with additional support for register charitable organisation that be work tirelessly to safely house veteran 
 we do indeed and we be put in extra fund and great support to deal with the problem of homeless veteran i be happy to thank and pay tribute to the ancre somme association for its part in a successful armed forces day parade and celebration in falkirk i pay tribute to all the volunteer right across the country who make our local armed forces day event possible we pay tribute to the regular the reservist the veteran the cadet and the armed force family but it be the volunteer who help we make these event happen 
 with base become long term and more predictable and with most young people want to buy rather than   rent their home what assessment have the secretary of state make of the success of force help to buy what plan do he have to extend it 
 unfortunately force help to buy really have not keep pace either with demand or with the success of civilian programme it be part of the force housing review that i have launch which i expect to report in the autumn the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that the aspiration of those who serve and who join the service be exactly the same as for every other work person in this country we should try to make that part of the contract that this nation make with those who will serve in future 
 housing be not the only issue affect armed force family when a member of the force move their family often move with they my work experience student amy who be in the gallery today be from an armed force family and attend primary school school provide dedicated support whereas other have less understanding of the issue that child whose parent be in the force may face will the secretary of state work with the secretary of state for education to ensure that armed force child receive consistent support at every school that they attend 
 we will indeed amy ’s experience be typical for many child of force family regularly move as their parent answer the call and be deploy in different area we can do well by they i be in conversation with my right hon friend the education secretary about how we can do well by our force family and force child but also about how we can do well for the cadet and the opportunity that they offer to all young people 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the recent announcement of funding to improve military housing but our fantastic service personnel deserve more than short term fix this year ’s armed force continuous attitude survey show that in personnel plan to leave and over a quarter of they cite the standard of accommodation as a reason that should be a wake up call will the government commit to go far and show a real commitment to retention by finally u turn on their decision to block liberal democrat proposal to bring all military housing under the decent home standard 
 no could describe the decision to buy back military family home from private hand as a short term fix nobody could describe the consumer charter set out basic housing right and standard as a short term fix and no could describe the housing strategy review we have get go as a short term fix the decent home standard be standard i think we can be do well by our armed force family 
 what step he be take to support veteran in hertfordshire 
 what step he be take to support veteran 
 what step he be take to ensure that veteran receive adequate support after leave the armed force 
 i would like to recognise mr roy briggs a world war veteran who recently pass those of we on both side of the house salute our great generation 
 as the secretary of state say we recently announce op valour the veteran support system which be underpin by £ over year and i launch the north west england pilot last week this be an institutionally resilient system it be not a stick plaster that will reform the system at the local the regional and the national level when we combine that with the covenant broaden from government departments to just on saturday that be a significant increase to both veteran and armed force community support 
 i thank the minister for his answer and for his kind word about roy briggs his family and i be also grateful for letter that he write to they i have the privilege of attend his funeral last week he be a real servant to our country have fly in many brave mission over europe he be part of of the raf ’s ever humanitarian mission when drop essential food over the netherlands and he also fly many mission in raf bomber 
 i know that the government be do various thing to try to support veteran could the minister outline the further step that the government can take to support organisation that support veteran such as the royal british legion as well as small organisation such as the hemel armed force and veteran breakfast club 
 the armed force covenant trust fund be of the mechanism we use to support the charitable sector but we must also step back and look holistically at the fact that there be armed force charity in the uk op valour will help to synthesise that get more bang for buck and ensure that veteran get the right support where and when they need it 
 a local charity in my area support woman veteran be recently work with a woman who be rehome in general purpose support accommodation for veteran in scotland the accommodation be entirely unsuitable for she as a survivor of sexual violence and lead to she be subject to a further sexual assault by a man who be also house there will the minister assure i of his work to ensure appropriate support for woman veteran 
 just last week i visit several different organisation of which be launchpad in liverpool which show some example of support housing for veteran it be not lose on i that female veteran have different requirement and we need to do more to support they we will ensure that that be cater for by have a woman ’s section as part of our veteran strategy 
 i welcome the government ’s investment in support veteran but as my hon friend   the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke   mention recently in the house female veteran be about less likely to be employ after service than male veteran what specific step be the government take to address that imbalance 
 i thank the hon member for that really important question there be piece that i would highlight the be the armed force career transition partnership which help individual during the year prior to their leave the service and for year after to find job the be operation ascend which look to partner career opportunity and business of which we have engage with over with any veteran or individual leave the armed force which have engage with individual part of our veteran strategy will include that from a woman ’s perspective we be do everything we can and over of veteran who seek help go straight into employment within the month 
 there be veteran in my constituency of which be disable many be concerned about the future support available to they can the minister assure disabled veteran not just in south northamptonshire but across the country what the department will do and that it will not forget they 
 that be an exceptionally valid point just last week i hold a consultation with the disability minister to ensure that veteran charity which really speak loudly for veteran and i could highlight any concern to he that be include within the consultation 
 what step his department plan to take through the defence industrial strategy to support sme 
 what step he be take to ensure that sme be able to participate in defence procurement contract 
 the government ’s modern industrial strategy launch last week announce a increase in mod spend with small and medium sized enterprise to £ a year by reverse the downward trend under the previous government our new sme hub will help small firm to access well opportunity and our reform of defence procurement along with ringfenced innovation fund will give sme access to the defence dividend this government ’s increase in defence spending will provide job and growth across the uk 
 basingstoke be home to some fantastic defence sme include nightball technologies and bertin exensor but issue that have be raise with i be that government procurement agency can not specify uk sovereign tech or sole source contract even where uk capability exist that result in lengthy competitive tender where there be a high risk that end   user do not get the capability that they need and equipment be buy from foreign supplier will the minister meet with i and firm from basingstoke to discuss how we can prioritise uk defence sme over foreign supplier especially where uk sovereign tech exist 
 my hon friend make an interesting point there be some flexibility under our procurement rule to specify national security ground upon which to make a decision half our spend be already through sole source contract i be of course happy to meet he and his sme we be deliver for defence by promote new procurement model that be easy for small firm to access and our sme hub will engage directly with sme to help they to access defence supply chain 
 in my constituency of north somerset many small and medium sized enterprise be spring up to support our country ’s rearmament effort in nailsea such company industry be recently block from open a business bank account due to blanket prohibition and excessive delay by retail bank hinder its ability to organise seed funding and bid for procurement contract will the minister meet with i to discuss the case of industries and the wide problem relate to financial institution and their interaction with defence sme that the case highlight 
 i recognise my hon friend ’s point and i will of course meet with he and his sme over the last month the defence secretary and i have convene stakeholder from industry and finance to discuss this issue and make it clear that defence be an ethical sector that they should support the strategic defence review commit we to develop a dedicated financial service sector strategy which we will aim to publish in spring that should give we a further opportunity to make sure that the finance industry know what a good investment defence can be 
 our uk defence industry can have few well ambassador around the world than our red arrows as the hawk aircraft come to an end will the minister look closely at the british design modular aircraft be develop by aeralis because it would support sme right across our country include by bring around job to standardaero in gosport and about to the south hampshire area surely that would be a much well way to support our national sme than opt for the italian russian yak-130 aircraft which the mod be rumour to prefer 
 i know aeralis well i visit it when i be in opposition as i know   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge   have do and i have speak to its representative since of course an open competition will be hold for the new aircraft to deliver advanced jet training and for an aircraft for the raf aerobatic team to ensure value for money and positive uk benefit and i hope that aeralis will apply for that competition it will have a very good chance if its product be up to scratch 
 i thank the minister for her answer she be a regular visitor to northern ireland and support the sme there so when it come   to the defence industrial strategy to support sme could she update the house and myself in particular on what she and the government be do to help sme in northern ireland to increase job and also increase contract 
 the hon gentleman be right to say that i have visit northern ireland and its defence sector on a number of occasion and i hope to return and do so again the increase in spend that be announce last monday on the modern industrial strategy for our sme to take advantage of an increase of up to £ a year should give opportunity for some of the innovative company in northern ireland to take advantage of the available money when our sme hub get up and run it will be available to assist small firm in understand how good to get access to some of the opportunity that that will bring 
 what step he be take to support defence sector export 
 in order to deliver for defence and make defence manufacture an engine for growth we must improve our export performance potential customer want a consistent government to government offer so as part of defence reform a new national armament director and defence export office will support defence export campaign and responsibility for the promotion of defence export will be transfer to the ministry of defence 
 it be welcome news that mod be commit to the establishment of a defence export office will the minister set out what this will mean at home for job in constituency such as mine in stoke on trent central where our proud manufacturing company stand ready to support uk defence and security 
 it will mean a coherent specialist approach to government to government agreement on sale of our capability be base in the mod which have expertise in those capability this be go to mean extra job and growth and that job can continue in the uk beyond the delivery of our own domestic order because there will be export order to fulfil that should reap a defence dividend across the nation and region of the uk as our manufacturing job continue to deliver for defence 
 ametek a defence manufacturer in my constituency have report to i that the process of get a defence export licence have almost grind to a halt in the past month could the ministry of defence send someone sufficiently threaten round to the department for business and trade perhaps the veterans minister to persuade it to get a grip of its process and speed everything up 
 i be sure that we can make representation to that department to ensure that there be no unnecessary delay in application for export be grant where that be appropriate 
 what recent discussion he have have with ally on military support for ukraine 
 at last week ’s nato summit i meet defence ministers include ukrainian defence minister umerov about surge support into ukraine with the uk also announce last week that hundred more advanced short range air to air missile asraam would be deliver to ukraine start in the next few week last monday i join the prime minister in host president zelensky in no where we discuss the ongoing detailed planning for the coalition of the willing and i be proud to say that and a half year into putin ’s illegal invasion this house and this country remain united for ukraine 
 yesterday alarm report indicate that russia have launch its large air attack on ukraine since the war begin kill at least people and injure many more clearly regardless of his claim putin be not ready for peace give russia ’s continue aggression what step be the government take alongside nato ally to increase pressure on russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire 
 my hon friend be right last night ’s attack be a reminder of just how fierce the russian onslaught on ukraine be but it be also a reminder that putin have fail in his strategic ambition and a half year into this campaign he have pass the gruesome milestone of russian casualty on the battlefield and he be fail to take the territory that he think would fall to he i be proud that the uk have step up with leadership on ukraine with the coalition of the willing alongside the french and by chair the ukraine defence contact group alongside the germans and that we will spend more than £ this year on uk military aid to ukraine which be the high ever level 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s comment on those terrible attack it should be a source of pride that some of the good drone and counter drone tech that we have supply to ukraine have be make by british sme the problem be that labour ’s procurement freeze mean that almost none of it have be buy in parallel for our own armed force in this week of labour u turn will the secretary of state consider another namely scrap the government ’s crazy £ chagos deal and instead spend the money on rapidly supply drone for the british army so that it can train for war as it be be fight today in ukraine 
 that be a bit of a bucket question on drone we be increase tenfold the number of british drone that we will supply to ukraine this year we be also step up the lesson we be learn from work with ukraine on the development of its technology battlefield harden and combat ready so that we can supply our own force with increase number of drone as part of the strategic defence review ’s vision for the way that we transform our force in the year ahead 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for northern ireland on the adequacy of legal protection for veteran who serve in operation banner 
 the veteran who serve under op banner serve to protect civilian life and secure the peace in northern ireland i share the right hon gentleman ’s deep concern that many may now be catch up in investigation or litigation and i be determined that we protect they far i be work closely with the northern ireland secretary as be our official to ensure that we discharge our duty to the veteran as part of the necessary plan to repeal and replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 during operation banner every single time a paramilitary be kill by a british soldier it be subject to judicial investigation the director of public prosecutions go through the evidence at the time interview people look at the planning document and be able to talk to people contemporaneously while they could still remember it it be not a rubber stamp it be rigorous as be prove by the fact that where necessary it lead to prosecution what be happen now be double jeopardy worse still it be double jeopardy under new rule but with no new evidence indeed there be a risk of lose evidence and lose memory give the passage of time i have hear what the secretary of state have say but will he commit to ensure that soldier who be subject to review at the time will not be subject to further risk of prosecution under the government ’s replacement for the legacy act 
 any incoming government would have to repeal the legacy act it be unlawful legislation it have be reject by domestic court and reject by community across northern ireland and it be simply wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise we owe it to those affect by the trouble whom the right hon gentleman speak about include our armed force community and veteran to be honest about the unworkability of that legacy act and to get this legislation right that be exactly what the northern ireland secretary and i be work together to ensure we can do take full account of all the interested party in particular those veteran and armed force community that the right hon gentleman speak about 
 i call the shadow minister 
 accord to the census there be more than veteran live in great britain clearly some of they have be busy lately their parliamentary petition entitle protect northern ireland veterans from prosecution with support from the daily mail the express and other now have more than signature and will be debate in parliament on   july which minister will respond to that debate so that we can ask they why the government ’s current remedial order be draft to help the like of gerry adams sue the british taxpayer while throw our veteran to the wolf 
 we welcome the petition and we certainly welcome the parliamentary debate it be quite proper that parliament debate these issue the right hon gentleman ’s legacy act offer false and undeliverable promise to the veteran of northern ireland the last government be warn that it would be unlawful and incompatible with the windsor framework even the chief commissioner of the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery say that the act have obvious problem and that element of it be dead in the water from the beginning we be now fix that flawed and failed legislation and we will do so in a way that honour our duty towards those veteran 
 the government could have appeal to the supreme court on this but deliberately do not i do not doubt the secretary of state ’s personal sincerity however at prime minister ’s question on   january the prime minister promise veteran 
 we be   work   on a   draft   remedial   order   and replacement legislation and we will look at every conceivable way to prevent these type of case from claim damage it be important that i say that on the record ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 why then despite the pm ’s solemn promise be the order still unchanged surely he be not expect to order his own mp many of whom represent red wall seat from which those veteran be originally recruit through the aye lobby just to do gerry adams a favour he be not go to do that be he 
 the prime minister be right then and he be right now i be work with the northern ireland secretary to repeal and replace the legacy act we will honour the prime minister ’s undertaking to this house and do right by the duty that this nation hold to those veteran who serve for more than year during the trouble in northern ireland 
 what step he be take to maintain the capability of the red arrows 
 the strategic defence review recommend that the hawk t1 and t2 be replace with a cost effective advanced jet trainer the future platform of the royal air force aerobatic team be be consider at the same time and a royal air force programme team be be establish to deliver that capability 
 the tsr-2 aircraft be a world beater unfortunately the only thing that it could not beat in a dog fight be a labour government who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing will the minister assure i that we have learn the lesson of tsr-2 and that we will look at the replacement for the hawk in the light of press a british design and manufacture aircraft that can sell britain abroad 
 the conservative party set as the hawk t1 ’s out of service date in its strategic defence and security review and it then do precisely nothing to achieve a replacement in the year that follow so i be disinclined to take lesson from the hon gentleman ’s   party on how to replace the hawk i assure he that the competition will welcome any bid from uk base supplier 
 what step he be take to ensure an always on approach to the shipbuilding supply line 
 as outline in the strategic defence review and in the uk ’s modern industrial strategy the government be commit to support an always on shipbuilding industry by leverage our buying power through public procurement and seek to export our capability to friendly nation 
 as the minister say the sdr speak of the need for an always on supply of shipbuilding with the royal navy continue to move towards a more powerful but cheap and simple fleet the minister have visit my constituency and see the construction of the type frigate by babcock at rosyth with the ship hms venturer recently float off other ship of the initial order by the royal navy be progress well when can we expect to see announcement to guarantee the continued always on supply of shipbuilding and will she give an update on the need for more type frigate for the royal navy to reflect the flexibility of that platform as well as the low cost and fast production achieve by the incredible workforce at rosyth in my constituency 
 i recognise the benefit that the construction of type frigate have bring to rosyth and i have personally engage with international partner to try to secure future order in addition to any order that we ourselves may have export that type of capability to our ally and friend be a sensible way of ensure that we can keep production go at rosyth 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of hold cross party talk on increase defence spending to of gdp by 
 at last week ’s nato summit all nation sign up to a new defence investment pledge of of gdp by include for the time spend on national security national resilience and homeland security that build on this government ’s £ boost to defence this year the funded and cost plan to hit of gdp in year time and our ambition to hit in the next parliament 
 there be a great deal of experience across these benches and most of we recognise the imminence of the need to hit my expertise be in force protection and i know among other thing that brize norton can not draw support from the military provost guard service under the land top level budget such as at nearby dalton barrack and south cerney that be more acute still at raf lossiemouth will the   minister meet i to discuss the command structure of the mpgs and bring our experience to the table to find that of gdp imminently 
 my hon friend the minister for the armed forces will be happy to meet the hon gentleman he would be a much well person to meet than i on this matter 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 uk defence company need certainty from the government in order to invest and plan with confidence i welcome the prime minister ’s recent effort at the g7 and nato summit and his commitment to spend of gdp on defence by include on defence and security relate investment can the secretary of state clarify how exactly that will be measure will it involve new project and investment or will it merely be a reclassification of exist project crucially how can industry public body and other stakeholder contribute so that they can help to achieve that goal 
 my hon friend ask characteristically search question so let i send he the nato criterion that be publish alongside the pledge last week and let he and his committee when they interrogate i on wednesday afternoon pursue any further question that they might have 
 there be member on the government front bench who know a thing or about leadership i can say that with confidence because the prime minister be not in that place the government have a command majority and do not need the support of member from any other benches to hit of gdp and far if only the leadership of the labour party could get its own members of parliament through the division lobby give that the prime minister show no ability to do that with the change to welfare how will he ensure that be spend on defence in a timely manner 
 the conservatives hollow out and underfunde defence for year those be not my word but those of the right hon gentleman ’s former cabinet colleague ben wallace this year there have be a £ boost in defence spending but in his government ’s year in there be a £ cut in defence just as we boost defence spending this year we will increase it to by which be year early than the right hon gentleman argue for we have show exactly how we will fund that we have take the decision which he do not take to switch funding from overseas development aid into defence and just as we have show where the money be come from in this parliament in the next parliament we will do the same 
 i too welcome the commitment to get to of gdp on defence spending by it be imperative that the increase in defence spending mean that funding be get to those on the cutting edge of defence innovation cody technology park in farnborough be already home to world class defence innovation with a wide range of small and   medium sized enterprise work there alongside qinetiq and it be where dragonfire have just be develop what role do the minister see for exist place such as cody in deliver our defence industrial strategy will she meet i to discuss whether cody could be the home for the new defence sme hub 
 i see a huge role i hope that my hon friend take the commitment that the chancellor and i make alongside the spring statement to set a new target for direct defence investment in sme as a sign of that commitment while i be in the business of commit my ministerial colleague to meeting i know that my right hon friend the minister for defence procurement and industry would be only too happy to meet she and to draw on her expertise as part of the development of our defence industrial strategy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on defence spending be not the truth that labour ’s promise to reach of gdp let alone or be just smoke and mirror because there be no actual plan to pay for it how can the government claim that they will properly invest in our defence and keep the country safe when they can not even deliver the limited saving they have promise on welfare so i ask the secretary of state where be the money come from 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to the dispatch box and to the conservative front bench team alongside his very distinguished colleague   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   and   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge i gently say to he that since the election his colleague the shadow defence secretary argue time for by he only change his tune after february when the prime minister show how it be go to be fund and say that we would do it year early in we have show how we will raise the extra funding for this record increase in investment in defence since the end of the cold war we have show exactly how it be cost and exactly how it will be fund in this parliament and in the next parliament we will do the same 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government ’s commitment to reach on gdp on defence spending be the right decision as we face the once in a generation threat from russia it be vital that we regenerate our armed force after year of decline under the conservatives however we need more urgency the international institute for strategic studies warn that if there be a ceasefire in ukraine russia could 
 pose a significant military challenge to nato ally as early as 
 in order to strengthen our defence we need to give people well incentive to join the armed force will the minister consider accelerate recruitment by back the liberal democrat proposal for a £ signing bonus to attract new recruit 
 we be accelerate recruitment we be deal with the deep seat and long run failure in recruitment because the previous government over   year set and then fail to meet their own recruitment target we be deal with the recruitment and retention crisis in the armed force i be proud to say that last year we give the armed force the big pay rise for over year that this year there will be another inflation bust pay rise and that we be start to provide well pay well kit well housing and well support for force family the sort of thing that will keep those valuable and value member of the armed force serve our country and protect we all 
 what estimate he have make of the cost to his department of the uk mauritius agreement concern the chagos archipelago include diego garcia 
 as the defence secretary have say the cost of the agreement represent less than of the annual mod budget this have secure unrestricted access to and use of the base on diego garcia control over movement of all person and good on the base and control of all communication and electronic system it be a good deal 
 i do not know that i agree with the minister that this be a good deal although i be curious about the £ do it count towards the new nato target of or the additional on top of that as we have to inform the mauritian government before we do anything particularly useful from that base should that cost actually be count in the defence number at all 
 let i squash the hon gentleman ’s last comment which be wrong we do not have to inform mauritius before take any military action under the treaty we have to provide notification after the event i have explain this time in write answer to member on the conservative front bench but i be afraid that they still do not get it that underline why they could not do a deal after round of negotiation whereas this government do it after round secure the future of that vital base for uk and us operation 
 be it not the case that our close ally the united states australia canada new zealand and even india have all welcome this deal precisely because they recognise the irreplaceable role of diego garcia in global security what do the minister think be go on with the opposition who think they know more about global security than the security service the white house and the pentagon 
 this be important because the future of diego garcia be absolutely vital have accept the principle that sovereignty could be secure only by a negotiate settlement that be the decision take by the last government it be right that we secure a deal and right that we protect the base for operation for more than year the deal be good value for the uk taxpayer because it secure the most valuable piece of military real estate on the planet and keep it under uk control for the next century and beyond 
 what step he be take to increase security at military basis in the uk 
 follow the disgraceful criminal vandalism that we see at raf brize norton we immediately implement a series of enhanced security measure at that air base and at other defence site to ensure the safety of personnel asset and operation the strategic defence review highlight brize norton as be in need of investment after the hollowing out of our armed force over the previous year we have direct that a wide review be carry out at pace to assess and ensure protective security at all defence site phase of that review be complete this weekend and i will make far wide announcement in due course 
 to what extent be the ministry of defence work with other government agency to ensure a join up response to emerge threat to military equipment and infrastructure 
 counter terrorism police be still investigate the incident at raf brize norton and it be right that we allow they the space to complete that investigation the wide review look at security at not just raf brize norton but all defence site we be look with colleague across government at what investment be need and at how we can work with other to secure the safety of site to ensure that the uk maintain operational security for all its asset 
 almost by definition raf site have to have very long perimeter fence so it be understandable that they could be overcome at point or another why be they apparently not fit with sensor at least so that any intrusion would have sound the alarm 
 i do not want to pre empt the finding of all the review but the right hon gentleman be right that our air basis tend to cover a large area the perimeter fence we inherit on many of our air basis be not design to keep everyone out with large thing but to be a perimeter defence in the ongoing security work we be look at how technological solution and change in guard might contribute to enhanced security give the increase threat that we face 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of regulation on the use of autonomous weapon system 
 the strategic defence review set out that the uk will harness new technology through dynamic network of crew uncrewed and autonomous system we will always comply with the relevant regulatory framework and international humanitarian law i can tell my hon   friend that ihl compliance be absolutely essential as we look to use more artificial intelligence enable weapon system in the future 
 the strategic defence review rightly emphasise the importance of autonomous weapon system in augment the uk ’s defence capability but it also note 
 the uk ’s competitor be unlikely to adhere to common ethical standard in develop and use 
 those technology what specific measure be the government take to help prevent and mitigate the potential harm of autonomous capability both in the uk and abroad 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we maintain responsible ai system in the face of adversary perhaps use ai in malign way the uk will adhere to our legal obligation and the value of the society that we serve through the un and other process we be actively engage in international dialogue on responsible ai lethal autonomy and related strategic challenge but all our activity will be in compliance with international humanitarian law 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 last week nato nation come together at the summit in the hague unite in collective deterrence and in our collective defence of the euro atlantic area i can report to the house that nato be now big strong and more lethal than before we sign a new defence investment pledge of of gdp by with new capability commitment from each nation it be a good day for nato a good day for british job and a bad day for putin 
 everyone at the summit agree that iran should never have nuclear weapon we all want the ceasefire between israel and iran to hold and we will work to support it finally we also discuss it create a new opportunity for a ceasefire in gaza which would be a vital step on the path to peace 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for his response now that the prime minister have make a cast iron commitment to meet nato ’s defence spending target will the secretary of state make a similarly welcome commitment to cross party talk to establish a credible and durable path towards meet that goal ahead of nato ’s capability review 
 i welcome the liberal democrats support for the commitment we have make at nato the leader of the opposition be unable to offer that support at prime minister ’s question last week if the hon gentleman have idea about how we should fund that commitment in the next parliament i would be perfectly happy to hear they 
 nothing matter more than home so i welcome the huge progress that have be make on   force housing over the past month especially for force family do the minister agree that the opposition ’s half baked reprivatisation plan would be a huge threat to those in the armed force and their family 
 that be a really valid point the trouble be that the plan risk the deal we have with annington it would outsource all the housing and take control away from the government the ministry of defence and the military family who would be live in that housing our housing strategy will come in after the summer and it will be well think through and deliver 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 do the secretary of state support the action take by the united states to bomb iranian nuclear facility 
 as i say in my response to   the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton we be absolutely determined that iran should never have a nuclear weapon we have be work with ally on a diplomatic path now that a ceasefire be in place the mind of all nato leader include president trump be on put our weight behind that diplomatic path that be the way towards ensure a sustainable and verifiable end to any nuclear programme 
 it be extraordinary that a british secretary of state for defence be unable to give his explicit support to the military action of our close ally the united states be the real reason why labour can not back us military action against iran not the same as the reason why it will not u turn on chagos or on northern ireland veteran that when it come to choose between legal theory and the national interest this prime minister be a lawyer not a leader 
 absolute rubbish the uk and the us be the very close of defence intelligence and national security partner the us be strongly behind the deal we have do on diego garcia because it know that that deal secure the operational sovereignty there of the uk and the us for the next year and beyond

 with permission i will make a statement on the government ’s welfare reform 
 this government believe in equality and social justice and we be determined to build a fairer society in which everyone have the chance to fulfil their potential and achieve their ambition no matter where they be bear or what their parent do we know as all labour government have know that the only way of unlock the potential of individual and of our country as a whole be to collectively provide real opportunity and real support 
 i be proud of the step that this government have already take to deliver on our promise of a well future for all interruption we be create more good job in every part of the country include through our modern industrial strategy and plan for clean energy we are—[interruption 
 order i say to those on the opposition front bench that the statement have only just start you might not be interested but i know my constituent be i expect the same courtesy when you speak 
 we be invest in our vital transport infrastructure and in skill and get the nhs back on its foot our landmark employment rights bill will improve the quality of work and our increase in the national minimum wage be help make work pay but alongside these vital step we need to reform the welfare state 
 the principle set out in our pathway to work green paper be root in value that i know many mps share that those who can work must work but often need proper support to do so that those who can never work must be protect and that the welfare state must be fair both for those who need support and for taxpayer so that it be sustainable for generation to come but the system we inherit from the conservative party be fail on all those front it incentivise people to define themselves as incapable of work just to be able to afford to live it then write they off and deny they any help or support the result be of our fellow citizen now out of work due to long term sickness and almost young people not in education employment or training which be a staggering in of all our young people the future sustainability of the system have also be put at risk with the number of people on personal independence payment set to more than double this decade to over with award increase at twice the rate of increase in the prevalence of disabled people in our society add new pip award every single day 
 i know that government members have welcome many aspect of our reform our plan to bring in the ever sustain above inflation rise to the universal credit standard allowance the permanent real term increase in the headline rate of out of work benefit since the 1970 which be an historic change in the direction of public policy the big ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people quadruple what we inherit from the tories to £   a year our plan to ensure that people with severe lifelong health condition will never be reassess remove all the unnecessary and unacceptable anxiety this bring and our plan to legislate for a right to try guarantee that try work in and of itself will never lead to a benefit reassessment and give people the confidence to take the plunge and try work which many organisation have call for for year 
 however there have also be real concern about our initial proposal we have listen carefully and we be make positive change as a result and foremost many member of the house alongside disabled people and their organisation have be very concerned about require exist claimant to score a minimum of point on at least activity to be eligible for the daily living component of pip when they be reassess after november they have also be concern that the pace of change be too fast i fully understand that even though out of people claim pip when the change come in would be unaffected by the end of this parliament this have cause deep and widespread anxiety among exist claimant because they rely on the income from pip for so many different aspect of their life so we will now ensure that the new point requirement will apply only to new claim from november this mean that no exist claimant will lose pip because of the change bring forward in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill and exist claimant of passporte benefit such as carer ’s allowance will continue to get they too 
 some people have say they be concerned that this will create a tier system but i say to the house include conservative members that our benefit system often protect exist claimant from new rate or new rule because life have be build around that support and it be often very hard for people to adjust for example some people still receive the severe disablement allowance which be close to new claim in when labour introduce the local housing allowance in exist claimant stay on the old high rate of housing benefit and many people be still on disability living allowance which pip replace in we believe that protect exist claimant while begin to focus pip on those with high need for new claimant strike the right and fair balance 
 the important question raise by member be about see more detail of our wide review of the pip assessment before be ask to vote on the change in the bill many mp also want to know that the view and voice of disabled people will be hear at the heart of our plan so we have today publish the term of reference for our wide pip review lead by the minister for social security and disability to ensure that this vital benefit be fit for the future take account of change in society since it be introduce the review will look at the role of the pip assessment include activity descriptor and the associated point to ensure that they properly capture the impact of long term health condition and disability in the modern world it will be co produce with disabled people their organisation clinician other expert and mp before report to the secretary of state by autumn next year and implement as soon as possible thereafter 
 the issue of concern be that our plan to freeze the universal credit health top up for exist claimant and for future claimant with severe lifelong health   condition and those at the end of life would not protect income in real term even with the increase in the universal credit standard allowance i can today confirm that we will ensure for those group the combine value of the universal credit standard allowance and the health top up will rise at least in line with inflation protect their income from these benefit in real term every year for the rest of this parliament together with the change to our proposal for pip that will ensure that no exist claimant be put into poverty as a result of the change in the bill 
 finally while there have be widespread support for the extra investment that we be put into employment support for sick and disabled people i know that many labour members have be concern that that be not enough i can today announce that we be put an additional £ into employment support for sick and disabled people we will be deliver a total of £ for support next year £ the year after and £ in increase our total spending on employment support for sick and disabled people to £ over this parliament because disabled people who can work should not wait to have the same right and chance to work as everybody else the measure that we be announce today will cost around £ in and the overall saving and costing of our reform package will be certify by the office for budget responsibility in the normal way at the next fiscal event 
 welfare reform be never easy but it be essential because there be no route to equality or social justice base on great benefit spending alone the path to a fairer society where everyone can thrive where people who can work get the support they need and where we protect those who can not work that be the path we seek to build with our reform our plan be root in fairness for those who need support and for taxpayer they be about ensure the welfare state survive so that there be always a safety net for those who need it and that it last for generation to come above all our reform be root in our fundamental belief that everyone can fulfil their potential and live their hope and dream if we provide they with the right help and support this be the well future that we seek to build for our constituent and our country i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the right hon lady for advance sight of her statement 
 this be a government in chaos open rebellion from their own back benchers unfunded u turn cost billion and welfare plan that be not worth the paper they be write on their late idea be a tier welfare system to trap people in a lifetime on benefit and deny they the dignity of work while leave the taxpayer to pick up the ever grow bill 
 it be a long hold conservative belief that those who can work should work work provide security and purpose that be why we launch universal credit simplify complex benefit and ensure that work always pay and it work in the decade up to the pandemic we get the number of people on benefit and the benefit bill itself down some job be create for every day that we be in office give million of people the dignity and security that work bring 
 but then during the pandemic we see something new the health and disability bit of our benefit system start to break the bill be forecast to hit £ by in every pound of income tax will be spend on health and disability benefit more than the entire defence budget that be not fair for the taxpayer not fair for people who be write off and certainly not sustainable for the country 
 despite labour have year in opposition and now a year in government they still do not have a plan to bring down the welfare bill or get people into work what we have before we now be a rushed and chaotic compromise that be not reform in any sense of the word it be woefully unambitious about saving conspicuously lack in compassion and achieve no meaningful change of a system we all know be break thank to the government ’s late climbdown we be leave with a plan that will save just £ of a £ bill by introduce a tier system people diagnose with parkinson ’s a week apart will now receive different level of support all to clear up an internal labour argument the government ’s own impact assessment show that these plan will not get a single person into work the idea that work be the guide motivation for these change be laughable 
 there be thing that the government could do they could reform the fit note system which see of people who apply tell that they be too sick to do any work at all they could say today that they would make all sickness benefit assessment face to face they could get a grip of the rise claim for common mental health problem such as anxiety and depression claim for those and neurodevelopmental condition such as adhd be the main reason for the steep rise in the number of people on sickness benefit make up more than half of all new claim the centre for social justice have find that the government could save up to £ by reform those benefit however nothing that we have see from labour over the past couple of week suggest that it have the courage and conviction to grip that problem in the meantime our welfare bill will only continue to rise 
 we agree on the need for reform and have set out the condition under which we would support the government the welfare budget must come down secondly we need to get people back into work thirdly there must be no new tax rise to pay for increase in welfare spending but with the welfare bill ever grow unemployment rise and job disappear the bill fail on all account 
 will the secretary of state confirm whether the change she be announce today will be pay for through borrowing or taxation where be these good job she claim to be create when vacancy be go down and unemployment be go up have she read the impact assessment for the government ’s employment rights bill which make it clear that it will be hard for people to find work as a result why do it take the government a year to publish the term of reference for their pip assessment review and when can we expect change if it do not report back until autumn could i try more time to ask what the difference be between the secretary of state ’s right to try guarantee and our chance to work guarantee 
 finally be this it be there any more saving be the government not go to get any more people into work be this the extent of their ambition for   reform the welfare system during their time in office in year time will this be the secretary of state ’s legacy 
 i be in listen mode and i listen carefully to what the hon lady say once again her strategy seem to be to rail against the problem that she and her party create she have some chutzpah to talk about a tier system when that be precisely what the conservatives introduce when they protect people on legacy benefit when they move on to uc and replace dla with pip they be part of that and the hon lady should admit that rather than make those point she say we should bring back face to face reassessment we be do so it be the conservatives who switch they off 
 to be honest i be still no clear about what the conservatives policy actually be the hon lady and the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride claim that they have a plan to cut £ from the welfare bill in their manifesto but the truth be that it be nothing but a vague idea about turn pip into voucher she talk about fit note i think the conservatives try to reform they about or time but completely fail as have all their other effort the change the conservatives do propose be to the work capability assessment and their consultation be rule illegal by the court 
 what be beyond doubt be the mess that they leave our welfare state and country in economic inactivity be rise it be come down under labour disability benefit be double with the cost to taxpayer soar we be put in place real reform base on our value fair for those who need support and for taxpayer that be the leadership that this country deserve 
 i call the chair of the select committee on work and pensions 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for her statement i absolutely agree that we must reform our social security system under the previous government it neither support nor protect disabled people i be also very supportive of the principle that the government have set out 
 may i query some of the point that the secretary of state have raise however particularly about a new pip assessment process under the pip review that my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability will be undertake the secretary of state say that the point requirement will not apply until november and that the review will report in november but surely the pip review should determine the new process if this be be truly co produce with disabled people and their organisation the review should determine the new process the new point and the new descriptor we should not predetermine it as point now 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and i look forward to give evidence to the select committee about our overall proposal the bill bring forward a point requirement for all new pip claim after i have be very clear that that will apply   only to new claimant we be also committed to the wide review of pip so that it be fit for the future that will include consider the assessment criterion the activity descriptor and associate point to ensure that they properly reflect the impact of disability in today ’s world the review will conclude by autumn and we will then implement as quickly as possible any change arise from it 
 we have to get the right balance here i have be a long stand champion of co production include when i be the shadow minister for social care we have to do that properly but the point minimum will be in place for new claimant as we look to make change for the future 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the prime minister and many ministers have identify that the benefit system be break and its cost be skyrocket but balance the book on the back of the poor be wrong headed in the extreme the proposal today be a leap into the dark my liberal democrat colleague and i be really concerned that they be rush proposal legislation that be rush be often wrong with unintended consequence as the member of parliament for torbay i be concern as my liberal democrat colleague be about the disabled and long term sick their child their family and carer 
 there be some root cause our broken nhs and social care system need to be resolve so that support be there for those most in need our access to work scheme be break and need resolve as a matter of urgency there be some real challenge so i hope that the secretary of state will give some genuine answer what consultation have she undertake with carer what cost shunt for our care and social need system have she identify in the proposal finally will she consider withdraw these proposal so that there be adequate consultation and scrutiny to avoid any bystander be hit 
 i know that the hon gentleman care passionately about these issue he raise the urgent need to ensure that our nhs be back on its foot we be begin to make a difference with waiting list down for the time in year and with appointment more than double we promise create in our year 
 the hon gentleman talk about the failing of access to work i absolutely agree that be why as part of the green paper we be look to reform it so that it be available to more people in future we care passionately about family carer as i say in my statement exist pip claimant will be protect as a result of the change announce today as will those carer whose carer ’s allowance be a passporte benefit 
 we be also look at the future of social care with the review by louise casey we be bring these change forward because we do not think it acceptable that the uk have of the wide disability employment gap in western europe at which be much high than germany france and sweden we think that be unacceptable and we want to change it that be why we be make these reform 
 rise 
 order can we try to speed up question and answer no it be not the secretary of state ’s fault i be just think of the number everybody want to make a comment and i understand why johanna baxter will give we a good example 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s statement the additional £ for employment support and that the pip review will be co produce with disabled people and their representative but many of my constituent be rely on the scottish government for employment support and for get waiting list down to help they back into work will she outline what discussion she be have with the scottish government to address those concern 
 our new job and career service apply in all part of the uk include scotland to help get more people back into work with personalised support the spending review have deliver an additional £ for scotland it be the big ever settlement in the history of devolution i hope that the snp match our ambition to get more people into good work instead of cut the employability budget as it have do in recent year 
 i think that the vast majority of people in this country believe in a welfare system that be compassionate to the vulnerable and particularly to the disabled but they can no long understand why so many people here in contrast to other similar country be in this situation where they be not work 
 it ’s because you be in power for year 
 yes we be in power for year and during covid when i be a minister we make decision such as stop face to face assessment because we could not do they we all recognise that the recovery from that covid time have not go as well as it should but if the secretary of state can not deliver a shift in the number the economy will be in a death spiral she need to recognise that these change need to be reset radically to meet the country ’s expectation 
 i absolutely believe that we have to reset the system we have to make sure that everybody who can work get the opportunity to do so and the support they need that be precisely what we be try to do with these plan i gently say to the right hon gentleman who i admire that it be precisely that failure and that mess that we be now try to tackle 
 i thank the secretary of state for the movement make in the last week it would have be good to have have those conversation early but we be where we be in response to the chair of the work and pensions committee my right hon friend speak about the november deadline and the point kick in will she explain to the house the rationale for settle on those point in category prior to the timms review 
 our objective here be as it always have be and i be grateful to my hon friend and other for all their engagement with we we be make these change because we have to both get more people who can work into work and try to begin to focus this really important benefit on those with high need so that it be sustainable for the future that will not affect exist pip claimant who will have their income protect that be a very positive change that we be make the timms review will look at those descriptor and the point that be allocate as part of a much wide assessment because we have to ensure that this benefit last for the future so that it be always there for those in great need 
 the secretary of state tell we that this week ’s u turn will cost £ a year by will she tell the house how she propose to cover that expense 
 this change will be fully fund and that will be set out in the normal way at the next fiscal event as i be sure all hon member will appreciate 
 i welcome progress but i can not countenance sick and disabled people be deny support to enable they to be independent in the future and people be push into deep poverty nor can disabled people across our country support these measure it be a matter of conscience will the secretary of state set out why we be vote on these matter tomorrow when the timms review mean that there could be real change to the criterion use in assessment for people to score point it feel like sign a blank cheque 
 i know my hon friend care passionately about these issue but no exist claimant will be put into poverty as a result of the change in the bill the figure that she be give be about notional future claimant and they take into account none of the record level of employment support that we be put into the system we have publish very clear evidence that proper support programme can get sick and disabled people into work and to stay in work make sure that they can improve their income and their life we have absolutely commit to co produce the timms review indeed we will be work very closely with disabled people on our reform to access to work and how we ensure that the pathway to work investment get the good result for disabled people and their family that work will take time but we will implement the decision as soon as possible 
 my constituent steve have be a fit active work person until about a year ago since then he have be debilitate by me which have leave he able to get out of the house for only about an hour every fortnight even get dress leave he need a lie down pip be already difficult for people like steve to access he tell i that he would rather have lose both his leg than have get i could the secretary of state tell steve why if he have get me to year later he almost certainly would not have be eligible for any pip at all 
 i be deeply concerned to hear about what the hon lady ’s constituent have be through i have many constituent myself who have real need but   have struggle to get pip we absolutely want to make sure that the whole assessment process work as effectively as possible i urge she and her constituent to feed into the timms review once again exist claimant like her constituent will not lose their income as a result of the change in the bill it be very common throughout the benefit system to have exist claimant protect on old rule and old rate that be what we be do today 
 i welcome the word of the secretary of state that recognise the need to enable disabled people to fulfil their potential since april i have engage with the government make it clear that i could not support the proposal on pip our manifesto commit to champion the right of disabled people and the principle of work with disabled people have no public consultation on these plan exclude the voice of disabled people this be not just about process this make disabled people bad off the principle of fairness mean that disabled people have a legitimate expectation to be consult in order to fulfil the public sector equality duty under section of the equality act why do the department for work and pensions choose not to consult with disabled people on the pip proposal and what work will it do to win back the trust of disabled people 
 my hon friend be a powerful voice and i know she will always remain so in this house we be absolutely committed to co produce this pip review lead by the minister for social security and disability she may know that we be also set up collaboration committee on access to work and pathway to make sure that we really get this right i look forward to meet she and many other disabled people and their organisation to make sure that we get this right as we go forward 
 to describe it as fair and equal to treat people with identical condition differently purely on the basis of whether they be an exist recipient of benefit be orwellian newspeak on stilt be n’t it 
 so why do the conservative party do it for year 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement will the timms review have the power to review the plan budget saving for future claimant of pip and universal credit health component also if claimant request a reassessment because of worsen health condition will they be assess on the current criterion or the new eligibility criterion 
 the pip review be not drive by an objective of make saving it be about make sure that this vital benefit be fair and fit for the future as be the case now people can request reassessment whenever they want exist claimant will remain under the current rule unless they request a reassessment until november from then onwards there will be that point minimum 
 if this be what labour think people vote for and what people want when they vote in july last year why be it not in the labour manifesto why do labour not put in its manifesto that it be go to cut the winter fuel payment keep the child cap and push more disabled people into poverty be it perhaps because the secretary of state realise how deeply unpopular and wrong these change would be 
 i do not expect the hon member to have read every line of our manifesto but reform the benefit system be in it so too be our commitment to tackle child poverty and i be beyond proud that the chancellor invest the resource we need to extend free school meal to all family on universal credit and lift child out of poverty that be a down payment on our child poverty strategy this autumn 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 we all agree that the welfare system need reform but many of we in this place believe that change to disability support should not take place without listen to disabled people ’s voice and experience over the last few day i have be hopeful that the government have show strength in listen and move on what they have hear however i have a question on sequence what be the logic of make change for future claimant before finish the timms review which be now to be co produce with disabled people could this lead to not just tier but exist claimant new claimant who will lose out and post timms review claimant 
 no that be not correct as i set out in my statement exist claimant on pip will be protect the reason we be make the change for future claimant be that we want to start to focus that for future claimant on those with high need for current claimant of both pip and the universal credit health top up no will be push into poverty as a result of the change in the bill 
 health and sickness benefit spending be set to hit £ by the end of the parliament so why be the secretary of state not bring forward proper reform rather than these rush cut impose by the chancellor that save only £ and that duck the difficult decision to deal with the scale of the challenge that we face 
 perhaps the hon member should make that point to those on his front bench who have year 
 i welcome the clarity that my right hon friend have set out particularly for exist pip claimant and those with severe condition but my constituent who i meet this weekend want to have an active part in design the change that affect they can she confirm that my constituent will be able to feed their direct live experience into the pip review 
 yes as i set out my statement we intend to co produce the timms review with disabled people the organisation that represent they other expert   and mp so my hon friend ’s constituent will absolutely be able to feed their view into the review we want to strike the right balance here because co production take time we want to do it as quickly as possible but it have to be do as effectively as possible i look forward to work with my hon friend and involve her constituent view 
 i speak to a resident a friend in my constituency over the weekend she be a wheelchair user since a fail back operation some year ago she currently get pip she get point for dressing and undressing and point for washing and bathing she need help with both yet she fear as do i that anybody with her exact need apply after next november will be leave without help we be right be we not to be concern and to fear that that be unjust and uncaring be n’t it 
 i repeat to the hon gentleman that it be common through the benefit system to protect exist claimant from new rule and rate i also say to he that we be put billion of pound extra into the nhs so people can get the health and social care support they need we be put in place the big ever employment support investment for sick and disabled people because we know disabled people who be out of work be twice as likely to be in poverty that be the investment we be make his constituent will be protect and will not be put into poverty as a result of the change in this bill 
 i thank the secretary of state for her commitment to bring forward a strong bill work with colleague across the house the reality be that any of we in this house could become disabled disability do not discriminate it be important for we to recognise the network of informal care that keep our social care system go the reality be that a number of carer would not be eligible for carer ’s allowance without the pip eligibility and so many carer who receive carer ’s allowance be in poverty those people do not do it for the money they do it because they want to help a love or family friend i know from personal experience be a carer for my mum the toll it take when you help someone to bathe to get out of bed or to cook and clean these people do not do it for the money but they be scared can the secretary of state confirm that we will protect those carer in any future pip change because it be right that those carer should not be push far into poverty 
 my hon friend be a huge champion of these issue and i have long champion what unpaid family carer do as she say many do not even think they be a carer they be just a husband wife son daughter mum or dad look after the person they love i want to reassure she as i say in my statement that exist pip claimant and all those who get passporte benefit like carer will be protect as a result of the change we have make indeed i know my right hon friend the health secretary want to do far more to support family carer in future because without they our nhs would collapse 
 do the secretary of state agree that while necessary at the time of covid the removal of the requirement for face to face   assessment be an opening of the door to potential abuse if so will she commit in principle to the reinstatement of face to face assessment 
 that be exactly what we commit to in our green paper 
 presumably the outcome of the timms review will require some form of primary legislation to enact the change to the system that will come from the department for work and pension in which case i suggest to the minister that remove clause from the bill tomorrow and put it into any future legislation mean the department can still have its threshold in the future if it want to but only once everybody know against what criterion those judgment will be make 
 we be co produce this review and it may result in change that require primary or secondary legislation or other action and i do not want to pre empt that let i just bring my hon friend and the house back to the purpose of these change to ensure that we have a system that be fair for those who need support and fair for taxpayer and to try to put the welfare state on a more sustainable footing for the future if we do not do so my real fear be that it will not be there for the very people who really really need support go forward 
 today ’s statement feel like a panicked political fix to an indefensible attempt to cut benefit from the most sick and from disabled people but it lack competence and compassion give that the secretary of state talk about social justice how can she justify people who might need that support in the future not receive the support that disabled and sick people rightly receive today would the right thing to do not be to shelve these proposal so she can allow time to do what she have promise to do and to genuinely co produce and consult with disabled people on the right way forward 
 i fundamentally disagree with the hon gentleman ’s proposition our change be root in the clear principle that those who can work should work and need the support to do so and those who can not work should be protect but that we need a system that be fair and sustainable i do not believe that we can wait while disabled people in this country who want to work be deny the opportunity to do so we can not have a system where in young people be not in education employment or training with all the terrible long term consequence that bring we can not see in of our fellow citizen trap out of work and economically inactive because that be not a good future for they or for our country 
 we already know that the bill as publish be flawed because of the change that have be make in the past few day and announce today i welcome the wide review of pip and the consultation with disabled people their organisation and clinician but give the wide review and that the timms review be yet to report why be we push ahead at this stage 
 because we have to begin to reform the welfare state to help those who can work to do so to protect those who can not and to begin to put our   welfare state on a more sustainable footing the bill protect exist claimant they will not be affect by the change it ensure that people have a right to try and that those with severe lifelong condition never face reassessment it come alongside the big ever employment support for sick and disabled people together this be a fair and balanced package that meet the need of exist claimant and reform the welfare state for the future
