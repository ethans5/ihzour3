 the full electrification of the midland main line would significantly reduce railway operating cost and cut tonne of carbon dioxide annually current work on the line will finish soon move ahead with the rest of the project would retain the multidisciplinary skill and supply chain need for rail electrification in the uk the department have   already give we so much good news for rail so can the minister give we some more good news on this very important question 
 i commend my hon friend ’s support for this scheme and for be such a champion of the railway and her constituent i assure she that deliver green transport be of the secretary of state ’s priority for our department the extension of the electrification from wigston to nottingham and to sheffield via derby be in development and be plan to be complete by the early 2030s subject to business case approval and affordability consideration

 there have already be improvement in performance and a reduction in cancellation on the railway my right hon friend the secretary of state be work extremely hard to hold operator to account and to ensure that all our constituent enjoy a quality service from the railway it be essential that we put passenger at the heart of it for the time in a very long time

 the government be work apace to improve transport provision throughout the country we have already announce strategic transport priority to improve local transport performance and increase usage official will continue to meet local transport authority across the south west to discuss their aspiration 
 follow the point raise by   the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham may i point out that a great many other challenge have be reveal since the general election there be worry about expensive school transport and risk free investment in cornwall and there be also worry on the isles of scilly where we seek parity with scotland and the english mainland in respect of lifeline link to the island and indeed inter island transport it would be helpful if as well as meet the transport authority the minister could meet local mp because these issue be become very serious indeed

 my hon friend be an incredible campaigner on transport matter not just in her constituency but across the country it be true that rural community face different challenge but the government ’s well bus bill will enable local authority to take back control of our bus and improve service where they wish to do so 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 the state of the country ’s bus service be too often unacceptably poor after more than a decade of neglect and decline politician in my position have neglect they for too long and it show in september we move fast and announce transformative new measure to make it quick and easy for every local authority in england to have london style control over its bus service 
 public transport be crucial for rural community connect resident to essential service however between and england see a reduction in bus service with a per capita decrease when the figure be adjust for population growth that decline have have a severe impact on rural area such as my constituency leave many resident isolate and struggle to gain access to education employment healthcare and social activity can the secretary of state tell i how the well bus bill will improve the position for my constituent 
 i be aware of the premium that my hon friend place on public transport indeed i have campaign along with he in his beautiful constituency i be delighted to confirm that we will introduce a new bus bill this year to give local leader the tool that they need to ensure the delivery of high quality bus network put decision making into their hand and seriously accelerate the franchising process 
 bus service in the city of durham be an absolute headache for my constituent bus be often minute late in village such as west drayton the labour mayor of the north east and i want to   crack on and deliver our manifesto promise to bring bus back into public control can the secretary of state assure i that the well bus bill will allow we to enfranchise bus soon rather than later and will she meet the mayor and i discuss the bus situation in durham

 i be grateful to my hon friend who have put her finger on exactly the problem with the system across the country at the moment for too long we have allow private operator to pick and choose whatever route and service they want with no say whatsoever for local people or local leader the well bus bill be at the heart of our bus service reform and it will give local people a proper say on the route and service that they absolutely depend on 
 in my constituency of huntingdon village receive no bus service whatsoever include molesworth where we will shortly see a half a pound investment in upgrade and expand our defence infrastructure at raf molesworth give that franchising will potentially be introduce in cambridgeshire and peterborough will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can guarantee that our rural village be give the focus they urgently need 
 the hon gentleman have make the case for franchising it be totally unacceptable that entire village be cut off without the bus service that they absolutely need that deny people the opportunity to move around their area and get to work or education opportunity the mayor of cambridgeshire and peterborough be pursue franchising we be support he in those effort and we will make sure that village such as those in the hon gentleman ’s constituency be properly include in the franchising process 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i wonder if the right hon lady can see the irony in the fact that the new bus system that she be so excited about introduce be broadly the same as the train system that she be busy dismantle the simple truth be that without   funding the government ’s plan will not make struggle bus service viable or affordable for passenger what have help be our £ fare cap which have save million of people money and help to keep local bus go especially in rural area do the secretary of state agree that the £ fare cap have be a good thing and crucially be she go to keep it 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to suggest that the underfunding of bus service over a decade have lead to the cancellation and scrapping of thousand of bus route across the country and passenger number have fall over the last year we be committed to consolidate funding and end the hunger games style process that the previous government oversaw which pit authority against each other and create winner and loser

 i be read the treasury ’s fix the foundation document and i understand that because of the need to restore control over public spending the government have have to cancel the restore your railway programme however i note that individual project will be reconsider in the transport secretary ’s review will the minister please look at the development of the abertillery spur on the ebbw vale to cardiff line as he consider good value investment and connectivity in our railway infrastructure

 so many question as the executive agency responsible for walk wheeling and cycling active travel england be investigate how to improve the modelling and forecasting of cycling level to ensure that we invest appropriately i have ask its officer to meet sustrans colleague to discuss the potential benefit of its tool 
 the brilliant cycle to work scheme run across the nation of these island but under current rule it can not be use by people who earn less than £ a year this almost certainly contribute to the fact that only of people on low income have access to a cycle compare with of people on high income that be almost double various solution have be propose include the sustrans suggestion of a voucher give off the cost of a bike can the minister do anything to address this unfair situation and to help our national government support people on low income who would like to be able to take advantage of the cycle to work scheme 
 i recognise the problem with the scheme and i will work closely with treasury colleague on this matter i be delighted to attend the launch of the sustrans report in the palace a couple of week ago and i will pay careful attention to its recommendation

 as my hon friend know the uk aviation market predominantly operate in the private sector and regulatory cost be common to several industry my department be work with the aviation industry to understand the impact of these cost and i be sure he will continue to champion the public service obligation route between newquay and london which enable more passenger to use newquay airport 
 whether she have have discussion with the chancellor of the exchequer on increase capital investment in transport 
 as the chancellor set out in her statement this government inherit a £ fiscal black hole include billion of pound of underfunded and unfunded transport project we must fix the foundation of the economy so i be review capital expenditure in transport to ensure that every penny be spend responsibly to get the good value for money and to ensure that our investment power growth in every corner of the country

 i wonder whether the hon lady have speak to any business or infrastructure provider over the past year who have suffer appalling uncertainty and a lack of confidence her government preside over billion of pound of waste and failure in the delivery of infrastructure and have cost our economy hundred of billion of pound 
 i be expect the right hon lady to say something along the line of wait for the budget or wait for the spending review as we have hear many time during this question session however she do not wait for the budget to give union a massive pay rise to re announce our plan to get hs2 to euston or to signal billion of pound for a new hs2 light if she can make those decision before the budget surely she can confirm that every penny of investment that we have commit to transport through network north will continue to be invest in our country ’s transport infra- structure

 i want to provide the house with reassurance that this government believe that high education must be a space for robust discussion that expose both student and academic to challenge idea the decision to pause the act be make precisely because of the importance of get this legislation right the secretary of state indicate in her write statement that she would confirm her long term plan for the act as soon as possible since then official and ministers have engage with a wide range of stakeholder on the future of the act this include representative of high education provider and academic include those from the committee for academic freedom academics for academic freedom and the london universities council for academic freedom those official and ministers will continue to engage with stakeholder before any final decision be make 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this evening a member of this house be due to speak at an event at cambridge university that event will not go ahead as plan because of safety concern it be absolutely not for we to question operational decision making but it absolutely be for we to question this government about legislation and the effect direct indirect and chilling of the decision they have make since come to office 
 last year the higher education freedom of speech act become law in the end have attract cross party support after extensive work with student and academic it pass all its stage in parliament and receive royal assent that act be about protect free speech on campus include for visit speaker and it be about academic freedom to challenge conventional wisdom and put forward unpopular and controversial opinion however in july this year the new secretary of state decide without any parliamentary debate not to commence that act 
 the minister speak about a wide range of stakeholder some academic include nobel prize laureate have write to the secretary of state in support of the legislation do the secretary of state really think that those academic would support that legislation if it be as the government put it a tory hate charter will she now agree to meet those academic and will she please now do the right thing and commence the legislation that parliament have pass 
 this government be absolutely committed to freedom of speech the secretary of state pause the further implementation of the act to consider option and ensure we get the legislation right and she will confirm as soon as possible the plan for the act and long term plan for the continuation of freedom of speech in high education the high education sector minority group and union represent staff on campus have raise concern about the act believe it to be disproportionate burdensome and damaging to the welfare of student and fear that sanction could result in minority group concern be overlook mp and peer raise a whole range of these concern during the bill ’s passage by step back from the legislation to reflect on which of the measure introduce be need the government be take a pragmatic approach to ensure that high education remain a space for constructive dialogue and a home for diverse opinion it should not be a battleground for ideological clash 
 we be consider the next step i take on board the shadow secretary of state ’s request for the secretary of state to meet those he mention she have hold a range of meeting with all group that have concern and want a say in how this consideration continue i be sure that she will have further meeting and i will pass on his specific request 
 university and academic freedom be vital to the intellectual and economic health of this country free speech be mention in our manifesto early this year but there be no mention of this particular decision which be make day after the secretary of state take office sadly i therefore find it difficult to support this decision on that basis alone can the minister tell i whether when she talk about burdensome issue she mean the chinese government threaten to withdraw resource from our major university because i think that be at the bottom of the pressure that be unduly put on the secretary of state 
 i have hear my hon friend and recognise his point however i can absolutely reassure he that that be not a factor in make this decision it be very much about ensure that we take the time to consider option for the future of this act and make sure that we get it right it be because we believe in uphold freedom of expression and freedom of speech in our world class high education sector that we want to get this legislation right and that be why we be consider the option we will continue to listen to and meet all group that have an interest in uphold freedom of speech there be those who support measure in the act and those who have concern about measure in the act we will continue to consult and will report back on plan as soon as possible 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 freedom of speech be fundamentally about the freedom to inquire about and explore idea fact and datum that be sometimes difficult and sometimes inconvenient and it be the lack of fact and datum and even of much of an idea that fail to convince the liberal democrats of the need for the higher education freedom of speech act it be not base on evidence and it be not proportionate and the government ’s decision to halt its implementation be welcome however we should take legitimate concern seriously and we should not ignore those that exist within jewish community include in university what work be the minister undertaking to ensure that jewish staff and student feel safe and welcome in our community especially in our university 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s comment and recognise much within they the rise in antisemitic abuse on high education campus be deeply concern and this government take it extremely seriously we regularly meet universities uk to discuss what support university be offer to jewish student on campus and how they be tackle antisemitic abuse we also regularly meet the union of jewish students the university jewish chaplaincy and the community security trust and we will continue to do so to make sure that we get this right 
 can the minister reflect on the dire inheritance in education particularly in the high education sector 
 my hon friend raise an important point about the wide landscape and the challenge face our high education sector our university be not just vital for uphold freedom of expression freedom of speech academic debate and rigour they be also incredible seat of opportunity that must be unleash up and down this country we will continue to do everything we can to support economic growth which we know be support by high education and indeed by the whole of education the government be commit to that unleashing of opportunity 
 the secretary of state have say that she want to listen to different view and the minister have talk about the number of meeting that have take place so will she commit to meet the delegation of senior jewish academic lead by professor david abulafia who have already write request such a meeting 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right we be absolutely committed to consult with a wide range of interest in order to get this legislation right and i will certainly pass on his request to the minister with responsibility for high education who lead on this work
