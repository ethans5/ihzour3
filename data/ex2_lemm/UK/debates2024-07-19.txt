i be sorry there be not enough time for i to give way interruption member should have speak for less time 
 rural community have be severely undermine by the previous conservative government for a party that once claim to be the party of the countryside their track record be of abject and absolute neglect voter in the countryside reject their failure and embrace labour ’s positive vision that be evident from the huge increase in labour mps represent rural constituency and the collapse in rural support for the conservatives thank to the conservative party transport link in many rural area be now close to non existent there be more pothole in england ’s road than crater on the moon school can not recruit enough teacher gp surgery be full family can not find an nhs dentist thousand of rural business have collapse and rural crime go unpunished this be an abandonment of the countryside on a historic scale 
 yet instead of apologise for their failure the conservatives choose to deny the reason why rural voter turn against they in their million they be at it again today i take it from the comment the shadow secretary of state be make just now that they be so out of touch that they do not understand that rural community want more affordable home more dentist more teacher more gps well public transport energy security more digital connectivity well pay job well access to the countryside all around they and their river clean up after the tories leave they swill with raw stink toxic sewage they be out of touch out of idea and now thank goodness out of office

 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on the covid-19 inquiry yesterday baroness hallett publish her report from the module of the uk covid-19 inquiry which examine the resilience and preparedness of the united kingdom between and early 
 my thought and i be sure the thought of the whole house be with the family of those who lose love one during the pandemic their grief and the nature of their loss be harrowing with so many loved one lose before their time so many heartbreaking last goodbye say over a phone or ipad and in some case there be not even the chance to say goodbye at all so many friend and family member be deny even the chance to go to a funeral and many other find their life change by covid forever we can only begin to imagine the anguish and anger that people feel because this report confirm what many have always believe that the country be not as prepare as it should have be and that more could and should have be do 
 baroness hallett be unequivocal 
 the uk be ill prepared for deal with a catastrophic emergency let alone the coronavirus pandemic 
 she find that process planning and policy across all nation fail our citizen there be fundamental failure of state with poorly perform public service as well as health and social inequality contribute to our vulnerability 
 the inquiry find that 
 the uk prepare for the wrong pandemic 
 with a focus on influenza to the effective exclusion of other potential pathogen there be a lack of leadership a lack of appropriate challenge and oversight from ministers and official which allow major gap to open up in the uk ’s resilience in the period lead up to the pandemic 
 baroness hallett find 
 fatal strategic flaw underpin the assessment of the risk 
 and 
 a failure to learn sufficiently from past civil emergency exercise and outbreak of disease 
 ministers and official take false comfort from a positive analysis of the uk ’s preparedness not enough thought be give to how we might seek to prevent the bad effect of a pandemic such as with a system of test and trace rather than accept the consequence of spread as inevitable 
 in this emergency the crack in our society be expose the inequality be glare and that weaken the response that be why the report ’ finding on the most vulnerable be so important what it say about the elderly ethnic minority and those already subject to exist health inequality particularly in the early month of the pandemic those with high risk of serious illness who be ask to shield for extended period those live in overcrowded house work in the gig economy or on low income those who suffer as a result of the appalling increase in domestic abuse during the lockdown and of course disruption to education and the inequality of vastly different access to online learning and it equipment resilience have to be for all of we not just some of we 
 the underlying picture that this report set out be stark before the pandemic begin our public service be already stretch to their limit during what should have be normal time this be especially true of the nhs overstretch even before the pandemic hit and key worker in other service overburden in normal time and then ask to go above and beyond a nation can only be as resilient as the foundational strength of its infrastructure and public service 
 as i stand here today with people on nhs waiting list prison overflow council push to the brink and public service in a bad position than they be even in we must ensure that we be prepare baroness hallett say that it be not a question of if another pandemic will strike but when resilience be not just about another pandemic but about the full range of risk that we face we be remind of that this morning as report come in about a global it outage affect airline gp surgery bank medium and other organisation it be not easy to know what the future hold we can not plan fully for every possible risk but we must do what we can to learn the lesson of this period 
 the government ’s responsibility be to keep the public safe that be a top priority of this government with a long term approach to strengthen our national resilience i shall lead a review of our national resilience against the range of risk that the uk face i shall chair a dedicated cabinet committee on resilience to oversee that work of course it be not just about central government so we will work with the devolved government regional mayor and local leader as we consider the report ’s recommendation when we have an emergency we should do everything we can to work together locally and nationally the prime minister have already start to reset relationship with critical partner because resilience be too important for division to get in the way instead it have to be about co operative strength 
 some improvement to our operational effectiveness have already be make the previous administration do make effort to improve preparedness these include change in the way that the government access analyse and share datum include with the public they also change the risk assessment process and the way in which the centre of government work to prepare for and respond to crisis as an incoming government in office for just week we will look at those effort in the come month as we develop our own approach where thing be good they should be keep where they be not good enough they should be change 
 the inquiry ’s report recommend improvement in the way whole system risk be assess and manage across the uk government and the devolved government and improvement to the leadership and oversight provide by ministers the government will carefully consider all the finding and recommendation include any from the grenfell inquiry that also have a bearing on resilience planning we will respond in full within month 
 we will also play our full part in international effort to improve global health and pandemic preparedness from disease surveillance and vaccine development to strengthen health system in the global south and build even great international co operation the united kingdom have a huge amount to offer and it be in our national interest to do so because as we have see so powerfully pandemic do not respect international border so global health security be an essential element of national security 
 i wish to thank baroness hallett and her team for all their work so far and for put the voice of the bereaved at the heart of the inquiry amid the tragedy of the pandemic the british people come together in the most extraordinary way from the incredible service and sacrifice of our frontline worker not least in the nhs to the generosity of volunteer across our community support another with act of kindness it be a story of service that show the very good of our country this government of service be determined to learn the lesson from this inquiry and to prepare as good we can for the future that be the duty that we have to the people we serve and indeed to the memory of those we lose it be in that spirit that i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster not only for early sight of his statement for which i be grateful but for his tone in how he address what be an extremely sobering report module of i suspect that we will look at many more such sobering report in the come month 
 i put on the record our gratitude to lady hallett and her team for the work that they have do and to all the witness who give evidence particularly those who have experience loss and trauma that evidence be vital but give it will not have be in any way easy give what they have be through i pay tribute to they this module the of be not only a hugely important piece of work but the least this country owe to those who lose love one in the course of the pandemic 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster rightly talk about how this country come together in the face of an unprecedented event about which we learn more every day as the country have to adapt to change knowledge i join he in pay tribute to emergency worker and all across the country who work in whatever way to come together and help the country get through but particularly to those who work in the nhs and care service and those who lose someone it be an incredibly traumatic time for the entire country 
 what have be set out by the right hon gentleman today and by lady hallett yesterday be deeply sobering it lay bare failure of the state in respect of planning challenge resourcing and leadership irrespective of government or party in power it be incumbent upon we all to consider it in the spirit in which lady hallett have put forward her recommendation 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his recognition of the work already do since the pandemic to improve resilience in this country and ensure that we be well prepared for the next we start that work in government have announce the large overhaul of our resilience structure in decade we create the resilience directorate within the cabinet office break it out from day to day crisis management so that it could focus on resilience horizon scan and well preparedness we set up the resilience academy to increase and improve the training of ministers mps civil servant and all those in civil society who respond to crisis we also announce a new national exercise programme to test our system 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster highlight that the focus of previous pandemic preparedness planning be around influenza it be see in the context of operation cygnus which be often point to as the blueprint of how to prepare for these thing the right hon gentleman be right that it focus on influenza for which we have therapeutic in the case of the covid pandemic we do not as a country and a civil society we need to look completely across the piece at how we can well prepare for whatever eventuality may occur 
 in set out his next step the right hon gentleman adopt exactly the right approach i be grateful to he for that and for his candour there will be many more lesson still to learn it be incredibly important for our country this government and any future government that we learn the lesson to ensure that we be ready for future pandemic however painful those lesson be i be also grateful for the right hon gentleman ’s commitment to respond swiftly 
 i have a few question for the right hon gentleman what plan do he have to consult the devolved administrations and local government structure on the detailed change propose to how they would operate in the context of a future emergency what step will he and the government be take to ensure that our emergency planning structure be more cohesively join up if our country be to face another pandemic 
 more importantly i want to conclude by say that we stand ready to work constructively and openly with the right hon gentleman and the government in the national interest to ensure that as a country we learn the lesson from this module and from lady hallett ’s future recommendation to build well resilience in our country and ensure that irrespective of who be in government the country be well prepare in future that be the least that all of we in the house owe the country and those who lose love one or suffer in so many different way those whose mental health suffer the child who suffer from not be able to go to school those who suffer from domestic abuse and those up and down the country who in many way still suffer from what happen back then 
 as i have say i approach this issue in a spirit of co operation with the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster i look forward to work with he in the national interest and to build resilience for the future 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his response and for the tone in which he speak he set out what the previous government have do and in my statement i acknowledge that progress have be make but i think it be also right that a new government take the opportunity to have a fresh look at this with fresh eye and in the right spirit 
 the right hon gentleman ask a couple of question on consultation with the devolved administration yes that be essential as be consultation within england with local authority and elect mayor it be important that different part of the country work together when there be a national emergency there be also question about how this operate within government and the balance of responsibility between the centre and individual government departments baroness hallett be quite clear that in a truly national emergency the centre have to step up and responsibility can not be leave to individual department 
 the right hon gentleman be right to conclude with the spirit of co operation that we need on this issue this work be in the national interest and in the public ’s interest it be the duty of any government of any political stripe to do what they can to protect the public the challenge be that the risk we face be more complex and more unpredictable than they have be in the past as i say in my statement we can not fully plan for every risk but we have to try to have a system in place that give we the well possible chance of planning for the risk we can see in front of we 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement like everyone my thought be with the many victim who tragically lose their life i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hard work staff at st thomas hospital in my constituency who care for so many people in their last dying day and who care for the former prime minister when he catch covid-19 you will be aware mr speaker that the national covid memorial wall be in my constituency a stark reminder of the many life that be lose each heart painstakingly paint by a family member and dedicate to their lose it be a reminder of the many life that be lose will my right hon friend visit the covid memorial wall with i and meet the family and look at how we can make that wall permanent this be not just about resilience but about remember those victim who tragically lose their life 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to pay tribute to the staff at st thomas and other nhs staff across the country who do so much to care for people during that very difficult period i have visit the memorial wall in her constituency and she be right it be an incredibly moving and human experience i be very happy to take up her invitation to visit again 
 i call the lib dem spokesperson 
 i be cover for our spokesperson who sadly can not be here today 
 i start by pay tribute to baroness hallett and all those who have painfully give evidence to this inquiry it will not have be easy for they and our heart go   out to they this will be a painful day the inquiry ’s damn finding confirm in clear term what we unfortunately already know and this must be a moment for change the country be badly let down during the pandemic and this new government must ensure that lesson be learn swiftly the liberal democrats call for this inquiry back in and we will continue to demand that the full fact be know about every aspect of this catastrophic failure 
 area of particular focus be the lack of leadership provide by the then conservative government the inquiry find that proper scrutiny and accountability be often miss by ministers that be why back benchers across this house set up the all party parliamentary group on coronavirus which i be privileged to chair over month we hear from frontline worker public health professional and bereaved family and there be a deep frustration that they could see what be go wrong but it be fall on deaf ear in whitehall 
 this be a moment to change how politic work and i hope the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and the government will work across the aisle what will the government do to ensure that the right voice be in the room for future such health emergency and do they agree that we need a commissioner for ageing and old people as the liberal democrats have be advocate 
 care home be another area of critical failure many of those victim die not directly from covid but because of the lack of care do the government agree that patient and care home resident should be give a new legal right to maintain contact in all health and care setting 
 the area that have be under report be long covid many of we will remember stand in the cold in november bang on our drum for frontline worker yet they have not receive compensation for a disability that have put they out of their beloved profession will the cabinet office work with the department for work and pensions to progress the compensation scheme that be in train and to gather the right evidence to ensure that we get it right 
 ahem 
 very finally on the memorial will the minister implement the recommendation in the final report of the uk commission on covid commemoration 
 order may i just say to the front benchers that we be all learn but we should do so by set the good example you be mean to have minute not please can we help each other otherwise i will have member complain that they do not get in 
 i thank the hon member for her question and the spirit in which she ask they the truth be that it be easy for any of we to say lesson must be learn and whenever anything go wrong people say that the proof be in the practice will it be show in practice that be the ultimate test for we all 
 i be happy to confirm to the hon member that just as i say to the opposition spokesperson yes we be happy to work across the aisle on this and to consider   suggestion my colleague at the department for culture media and sport be consider the recommendation on the memorial 
 the minister speak of resilience he be aware that northwick park hospital in my constituency be the epicentre at the start of the pandemic and the lack of resilience mean that nurse there have to wear bin bag to protect themselves i note that he speak of grenfell in his statement that be fundamentally important because this be not simply about resilience in health in that regard i ask he to look at the issue of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete the same raac that cause problem in our school be use in many housing development at the time we need to be resilient to any potential disaster in that respect too 
 i echo my hon friend ’s tribute to the work of the nhs staff in his constituency raac in public building be part of the government ’s inheritance just because the problem have slip down the news agenda somewhat that do not mean that it have go away in time we will have to address it to ensure that such building whether housing accommodation or public building be safe for people to live in work in and be treat in 
 i congratulate the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster on his new role and welcome the tone of his statement the report be a stark reminder if any be need that even the most eminent and public spirited scientist can occasionally be wrong when groupthink affect assumption what can the government do to ensure that ministers and parliamentarian have access to the wide possible range of advice include where appropriate dissent voice across a whole range of issue 
 the hon member be right that groupthink be identify in the report so it be important for the government to have access to the wide range of advice but no part of that for i or the government will be about engage in anti science rhetoric or anything of that nature a diversity of view yes a denial of the fact no 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement yesterday evening i walk alongside the covid memorial wall and be move by the number of heart each represent someone who die from covid i extend my sympathy to all the bereaved family who lose love one many people of all age continue to suffer the consequence of the lack of resilience and preparedness due to long covid so will my right hon friend reassure members that those child and adult who continue to suffer with long covid such as the young granddaughter of of my constituent in shipley will not be forget as the inquiry continue its work 
 i thank my hon friend for her question again i echo her comment on the memorial wall follow the election we have a lot of new member   in the house if any of they find themselves with a spare hour they could do a lot bad than go to the memorial wall contemplate and look at the outpouring of grief that be reflect on that wall 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about long covid which i mention in my opening remark when we think about the pandemic of course we think about those who be lose and their family but there be also people several year on from the pandemic who be still live with those consequence 
 i thank the minister for his statement as the former minister of health in northern ireland who serve during the pandemic my thought and condolence be with those who be lose and those who be bereaved and i pay a tribute of thank to those who work across health and social care during that try time 
 the minister say that resilience have to be for all of we not just for some i ask he to ensure that all the devolved nation be equally involved he talk about there be a consultation with the devolved nation and region can i ask for it to be more than just a consultation and for it actually to be a partnership 
 i thank the hon member for his comment he be quite right this report cover all part of the united kingdom and it make a real effort to do so the new prime minister also make an effort to do so in the day follow the election and of his priority be to visit northern ireland i agree with the hon member about co operation i think it be essential small difference sometimes act to the detriment of the whole effort 
 i welcome my right hon friend and near neighbour to his place like so many family my family be affect by the death of a love during the pandemic and a small heart on the national memorial wall reflect my auntie for time immemorial do my right hon friend agree that procurement during a state of emergency such as the pandemic be important and that any fraud that occur must be pursue ruthlessly 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and ask that he accept my condolence on the loss of his auntie during the pandemic he be absolutely right to draw our attention to the procurement issue that have be highlight they be not specifically cover in this report but they will be as he will be aware this government will bring forward proposal for a covid fraud commissioner to recover as much as we can of the money that be lose to fraud or waste during that period 
 i welcome the statement from the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and be particularly pleased to hear he talk about the role of local government local government be instrumental in the response and i imagine the inquiry will find that have it have a great role there would have be well resilience however as we know local government financing be in crisis my own local council be try to save £ this year what   reassurance can he give we that local council will be give the funding they need to have in place the resilience we need for the future 
 the hon member be right to praise the role of local government my experience in wolverhampton be that the council step up and do a fantastic job for local citizen during the pandemic the financial position of local government be difficult the financial position on a number of thing be difficult i be afraid the truth be that i can not stand here and promise to write big cheque for everything we do not say that we would do that during the election and we will have to operate with a difficult very difficult economic inheritance everything that we do have to be underpin by economic stability and financial responsibility tough as that be i be afraid that we have see the consequence of do otherwise all too clearly in recent year 
 in her report baroness hallett say 
 the uk government’s pandemic strategy from be outdate and lack adaptability it be virtually abandon on its encounter with the pandemic 
 can my right hon friend give i an assurance that any future strategy will be robust and will be update regularly 
 of the thing that baroness hallett advise in her report be that every year there be a proper exercise to test any plan and see whether it be fit for purpose that be an important recommendation to take away and consider it be difficult to plan for every possible risk this be not an easy thing to do but it be really important to try to have the good possible system in place between the centre of government between the departments and as we have say between local authority and the devolve administrations too 
 may i thank the right hon gentleman for the constructive way in which this have be approach look both at the thing that go well and at the thing we need to learn have external scrutiny from the covid inquiry provide that len as the government look at the recommendation and begin to put plan in place some of that will build on the work that be already be do and some as he say will be on thing that need to improve i suggest that external scrutiny of the government ’s response be equally important will he ask lord norton ’s statutory inquiries committee to monitor the government ’s response to the covid inquiry 
 scrutiny be always good and i be sure that what we do will be scrutinise it be really important to have a proper dialogue with the public about these thing because it do no harm for we as citizen and as government ministers to have a conversation about resilience about what we do in an emergency and about we think about that we do not want to frighten anybody but it be a good thing to do and it be a proper role for government to have a good dialogue with the public about this 
 i visit the wall this week and it be a stark reminder of my own experience during the pandemic i be an operate department   practitioner and i work in emergency maternity theatre during that time from day there be next to no strategy staff be fight over inadequate personal protective equipment we try to speak up but we be not hear we be give out of date mask gown that be ill fitting and visor that just fall off our face 
 even when colleague sadly lose their life to the disease the chaos continue i sit with new mother hold their hand because their partner be not allow to be with they we stand by the bedside of a colleague on life support as they lose their battle with covid even now staff be traumatise all over again when people who have wait so long for treatment can not be help will this government ensure that nhs staff can have an input in future pandemic planning as it be we who know how good to protect our patient 
 i be very very grateful to my hon friend for reflect her experience there be nothing that i can add to the power of her word she be absolutely right that in planning for future pandemic we have to listen to the voice of the staff who be the people the country will rely on if we face any kind of similar emergency in future 
 member on both side of the house will recognise that child and young people really feel the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on their mental health their learning and their social and emotional development we all recognise that executive decision have to be take in an emergency to protect child and staff in school but i think the public be aghast that pub and zoo open before our school and college will the right hon gentleman ’s committee look at put a proper process in place potentially designate school and college as national critical infrastructure with this house take a vote on any extended lockdown of our school and college if those ever need to be put in place and with evidence take from the children ’s commissioner and our school and college leader 
 the hon lady be right to draw attention to the pandemic ’s impact on education through lose learning and as i say in my statement the great inequality that child suffer as a result of differential access to online learning do they have a good wi fi connection at home do they have the equipment be the school fully gear up to provide online learning the answer for some child to some of those question be yes but the answer for a lot of child be no it be really important in future planning that if we have to make a change we ensure that it do not reinforce inequality but help everyone 
 i put on record my gratitude for the service of the staff at the hospital of st cross and of other healthcare worker and volunteer across my constituency of rugby do my right hon friend agree that failure of state in the pandemic and in other case have often be due to under investment and an ideological suspicion of the state among some include regrettably some member of the last government do he agree that a party that put service and that believe in invest in our health service and wide government will ensure that this country be far well ready for future crisis 
 my hon friend talk about failure of state and that be the essential finding in baroness hallett ’s report there be failure of state he also mention ideology i try in my statement to make it clear that we would not take an ideological approach and that where the last government have do good thing in response to the pandemic we would keep they but i also think that a change of government after such a long period in power be an opportunity for fresh eye not necessarily in a partisan way but have a different set of people to look at what have be do keep what be good and change thing if need be that be of the advantage of a change of government regardless of political colour after have be in office for so many year 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and i welcome his announcement of a review of national resilience do he agree that the many legacy of the pandemic be still very much with we from the awful personal impact of bereavement and long covid to the terrible public service impact on everything from school readiness to social care system and more do he agree that those impact be bad than they need have be as set out by baroness hallett yesterday in that spirit do he agree that this government ’s work of renewal must necessarily also be a work of repair 
 my hon friend talk about the legacy and yes they be very much still here in term of vulnerability and exposure baroness hallett also mention the different impact on different ethnic minority community when i say that resilience must be for everyone that be also what i be talk about it have to be for everyone young and old and regardless of their ethnic background sometimes there be vulnerability particularly in the early month of the pandemic that expose inequality in that regard and that should give we all pause for thought 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and welcome he to his place may i also thank baroness hallett and her team and associate myself with the comment that everyone here have make to the victim the bereaved family and frontline worker as my right hon friend say the voice of the bereaved be at the heart of this report and that be right can he assure i that when the government be reflect on the recommendation that same spirit will be apply so that those insight go into the government ’s response 
 baroness hallett deserve credit for put the voice of the bereaved up front if anyone have look at the actual report they will find that before we even get into the recommendation finding and so on there be quote from the bereaved that bring home exactly what these loss of love one mean to people and the last impact of that here we be some year on from the beginning of it 
 i recognise the conclusion in baroness hallett ’s clear report and thank she for it in cornwall our peripherality make it so much hard our local authority ’s public health test and trace be halt by the government on    march   when few than half a dozen case be in existence in cornwall ppe come very slowly citizen be make mask and some councillor and officer drive up to exeter to pick up some care home and worker in particular be slow to get ppe in many care home in my constituency there be tragic result will we ensure that local authority public health director can be more involved with decision making and set up local solution such as test and trace 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the issue of care home where it be such a difficult situation throughout the pandemic we be try to get the right ppe to the staff it be a huge problem during the early week of the pandemic i remember raise question about that and it just expose what a scramble for safety there be particularly in the early month she be right to urge we to learn the lesson from that 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement mr speaker as you will have notice and as other people have refer to the report state that there be a failure to engage appropriately with local government in prepare for the pandemic sadly that failure continue throughout the pandemic i have the dubious pleasure of be the cabinet member for health and social care in hammersmith and fulham council throughout the pandemic we have to fight to close our care home because the hospital under instruction from the government be discharge resident without testing and would not listen to we and would not stop we have to fight to get vaccination in our local pharmacy and we have to fight to establish a local test and trace system which then reach of people when the government be only reach do my right hon friend agree that further stage of the inquiry or what the government now do should identify and learn from the previous government ’s failure to engage appropriately with the local authority not only before but during the pandemic 
 the point that my hon friend make about local government be well make as i have say my experience in my local authority area be that i think the local council step up sometimes the issue of who be vulnerable and where they be be much easy for a local authority to know than central government the spirit of co operation that i call for in my opening statement be in the public interest and the national interest and it be what we have to do if we co operate we will be strong 
 i thank my right hon friend for an important statement and i welcome he to his new role like many of we in this room during the pandemic i lose a good friend and harlow lose an incredible councillor in councillor frances mason an incredible community champion who serve her community until the very end in my constituency nhs staff at princess alexandra hospital be on the frontline during this terrible period their feedback to i be that the government ’s initial response to covid be too slow and fail to recognise the seriousness of the issue do my right hon friend agree 
 let i offer my hon friend my condolence on the loss of his colleague frances mason he be right to pay tribute to nhs staff baroness hallett have set out a number of failing whether speed leadership or co ordination it be important that we try to learn lesson from this and we intend to do that 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement may i associate myself with the comment make today about the bereaved and the integral role of our public sector worker throughout the pandemic local government worker across paisley and renfrewshire south be on the frontline during the pandemic they establish temporary mortuary to bury our dead and they look after the child of key worker so that they could go to work could my right hon friend say a little more about how to ensure that local authority will be treat as an integral partner in our resilience planning and the response that be about not just their funding but the respect with which they be treat by government could he assure we that in that spirit of co operation across the nation barnett consequential give to the scottish government will be pass on to their intended recipient 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the important role of local authority as other hon member have i hope that i have make it clear in my statement and in my response today that this must be an effort by the whole united kingdom central government devolve governments and local authority in every part of the country we be strong together 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and baroness hallett for her important report on the doorstep of camborne redruth and hayle the anger and grief be still palpable where be the accountability from minister where be the leadership royal cornwall hospital nhs trust be on high alert before the pandemic hit be it not the case that our nhs be desperately struggle year before through mismanagement from the conservative party and that life be unnecessarily lose because of it careful preparedness planning and management of our nhs and social care service must be a top priority for this government 
 my hon friend be right that the nhs be in a vulnerable position before the pandemic which be why the long term health of the nhs be so important my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care have begin that process i have to be honest with the house well long term strength for the nhs will not happen overnight but it should still be an important aim for we 
 i welcome my right hon friend to his place on the front bench and i thank he for his statement he touch on victim of what have be label the shadow pandemic the surge in domestic violence during lockdown do he agree that any lesson learn must include action to protect those for whom the instruction stay at home be the most dangerous they can receive 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he highlight a very important issue that i speak about in my opening remark it be an important aim of this government to reduce violence against woman and girl i can assure he that the minister put in charge of that will champion the cause with a passion and determination that i think and really hope will lead to result home should be a place of safety sadly as he rightly point out during the pandemic that be not the case for some 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement we all have story from the pandemic about how we and our family be affect that be as true for member as it be for constituent right across the country my family be on the other side of the england wales border and my stepfather be diagnose with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic i be not able to visit he and provide the support to my mother that our family need will my right hon friend assure i that we will create a join up national strategy as he rightly note the pandemic do not pay attention to our national border will he assure i that we will work very closely with scientist to ensure that there be a national strategy move forward 
 i thank my hon friend who highlight the difficulty people have in not be able to visit relative and so on be join up across the uk be really important as i say there be no place in this kind of planning to let what be sometimes small difference get in the way we have to work together in a co operative way we be strong together 
 module of the report find that pandemic planning do not take pre exist health inequality into account in my constituency those inequality be particularly wide as we see at grenfell tower i welcome the minister ’s statement that the grenfell inquiry recommendation will be incorporate into the government ’s response do he agree that in that response we must have a far well plan for protect the most vulnerable in our society who be often the most disproportionately affect 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his mention of the grenfell inquiry as i say it be important to take its finding into account it be also true that pre existing inequality leave people more vulnerable a national emergency like this expose weak point and bring they into the a glare public light and they weaken the response of the whole country the truth be that we have a strong response as a country if we manage to reduce inequality be they on the basis of ethnic minority or of income 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement to build on the previous question covid-19 bereaved families for justice uk have say that module of the report do not go far enough in look at inequality give the high incidence of diabete and other long term health condition in the south asian community in particular in my constituency and the disproportionately high covid death rate among disabled black and asian people what assessment have he make of the deep structural inequality in the health   of the nation after year of conservative inaction that cause we to be less prepared for covid-19 and that ultimately lead to unnecessary death 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question she be quite right to point out that the prevalence of a particular health condition can be high in part of the community as i have say a few time today the inequality expose in the pandemic make the response weak than it might have be if we be to be strong and well able to handle an emergency like this in the future we have to address those inequality that be not just in the interest of those it will help directly but in the interest of all of we because when it come to emergency like this we be all in it together 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement on the middle east i be very disappointed to miss yesterday ’s foreign affair debate due to the european political community summit and i welcome this early opportunity to come to the house 
 last weekend i visit israel and the occupied palestinian territories meet leader on both side my right hon friend the prime minister have also speak to both prime minister netanyahu and president abbas and i have discuss the issue with colleague from the g7 and of course the region this have be a priority from day because of the desperate situation in gaza and the serious risk of escalation in lebanon in particular i must be frank britain want an immediate ceasefire the fighting must stop the hostage must be release much much more aid must enter gaza israel promise a flood of aid back in april but impose impossible and unacceptable restriction and there must be de escalation on the israeli lebanese border i sincerely hope the party will agree a ceasefire as a matter of urgency 
 i have be discuss with partner the need for plan for what follow on reconstruction governance and security and for reform and empower the palestinian authority but president biden present his proposal nearly month ago so we in this new government have not seek to cloak our position in qualification or condition this horror must end now 
 my visit bring home the conflict ’s appalling impact i meet the family of those murder and take hostage so cruelly by hamas now separate from their love one for so long i tell they that the uk would continue to push for the immediate release of all hostage i also meet palestinians displace by settler settlement expansion and settler violence have reach record level the israeli government have seize more of the west bank in than in the past year that be completely unacceptable this government will challenge those who undermine a state solution 
 finally i meet aid worker from the united nations agency operate in gaza more aid worker have be kill in gaza than in every other conflict globally combine this year those who risk their life to save other be hero with journalist ban from enter aid agency be a vital source of information from the gaza strip and their report be devastating almost kill mother so malnourished that they can not produce milk for their baby river of sewage in the street a surge in disease among child with time the normal rate of diarrhoea and with polio now detect and looting aid truck driver be kill only yesterday i announce on my visit new funding for field hospital run by uk med which have treat more than gazans since the conflict begin 
 humanitarian aid be a moral necessity in the face of such a catastrophe and it be aid agency that ensure that uk support reach civilian on the ground unrwa be absolutely central to those effort no other agency can deliver aid on the scale need it be already feed over half of gaza ’s population it will be vital for future   reconstruction and it provide critical service to palestinian refugee in the region i be appal by the allegation that unrwa staff be involve in the   october   attack but the un take those allegation seriously i have speak to un secretary general guterres and commissioner general lazzarini follow catherine colonna ’s independent review we be reassure that unrwa be ensure that it meet the high standard of neutrality and be strengthen its procedure include on vetting 
 unrwa have act partner such as japan the european union and norway have also now act and this government will act too i can confirm to the house that we be overturn the suspension of unrwa funding britain will provide £ in new fund with some direct at support the management reform recommend by the colonna review unrwa support more than palestinians and almost of its staff have die in this conflict i thank the agency for its lifesave work 
 as we look for a pathway out of the wide crisis i be conscious of this conflict ’s complexity and be determined to listen to all side i approach every decision i must take carefully our overarching goal be clear a viable and sovereign palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel there be no way out of this crisis without a route to both palestinians and israelis enjoy security justice and opportunity in land that they can call their own we be committed to play a full diplomatic role in a renew peace process and to contribute to that process by recognise a palestinian state at a time determine by we not anyone else 
 i know that other aspect of this crisis be of great interest to the house include the government ’s assessment of israel ’s compliance with international humanitarian law in gaza the investigation by the international criminal court and what further measure might help to deter malign activity by the iranian regime let i reassure the house that i take those issue extremely seriously our commitment to international law be clear and we be follow the necessary process as soon as i take office i task official with a comprehensive review of israel ’s compliance with international humanitarian law and that process be now under way i will update the house again once the process be complete 
 year ago just week after i join the house president clinton host the camp david summit a reminder that this tragedy have last far too long there be those in this house who like i represent constituent who be convince that the world do not understand israel ’s predicament to they i say that israel be in a tough neighbourhood and be threaten by those who want it annihilate there be no equivalence between israel ’s democratic government and hamas a terrorist organisation responsible for an act of barbarism on   october   that seek to kill countless israelis and provoke wide conflict with palestinians i fully support the uk ’s role in defend israel when iran launch its unprecedented attack and i utterly condemn the houthi attack on tel aviv overnight 
 there be also those who like i represent constituent who be convince that the world do not understand the depth of palestinian suffering to they i say that civilian in gaza be trap in hell on earth the   palestinian people have be in purgatory for decade and have be deny the state that be their inalienable right 
 as foreign secretary i understand both those perspective i recognise the pain and anguish feel on all side it make i only more determined to do all i can in this office to advance the cause of peace i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the opposition spokesman 
 may i start by welcome the secretary of state and his team to their place they take up their role in of the great office of state which be commit to shape the future and the safety of our country that is after all the foremost duty of our government

 as the right hon gentleman rightly set out the situation in gaza be desperate too many palestinian civilian have be kill we continue to see strike on humanitarian infrastructure and the humanitarian situation be unforgivable the index on famine state that gaza be now in just that full famine i see this when i go on my own visit to the egyptian border with gaza and meet family who have have to be evacuate due to the severity of the harm cause to they we need an immediate end to the fighting and to secure the release of the hostage whose family continue to suffer unbearable torment on a daily basis so will the right hon gentleman please provide an update to the house on reassurance he have receive on the safety of the hostage 
 on aid in his meeting have the foreign secretary secure any reassurance to increase the number of truck go into gaza odd a day be just not enough in government we do everything we could to urge israel to let more humanitarian aid into gaza and open more crossing include through rafah and we treble our own aid commitment within the last financial    year do everything we could to get aid there by land sea or air we have success in get the ashdod port open as well as kerem shalom and help get airdrop into gaza the field hospital provide by uk aid funding to uk med have treat thousand of patient we also support and help to set up a maritime aid corridor to gaza the right hon gentleman announce today the return of funding to unrwa can he please advise the house on the timeline for that and provide assurance that taxpayer funding will be direct with due regard 
 only an end to the fighting will enable a significant scaling up of humanitarian aid the right hon gentleman rightly state that biden set forward a proposal back by israel and the un security council to end the hostility what action be he take to move that proposal forward can he also provide we with any reassurance he have secure in his meeting with netanyahu he rightly raise the case of extremist settler we be of the government to put in place sanction against some of they can he assure we that he raise this issue with the israeli government and whether more sanction will be forthcoming 
 the risk of escalation remain high particularly with hezbollah in lebanon so can i please ask whether his department assess any change in iranian intent activity or funding follow the sham election of the iranian president when they sit on the opposition benches both the right hon gentleman and the now home secretary be crystal clear that be they in government they would proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps so can we please now have the timing for this proscription 
 we all want to see an end to this devastating situation which threaten the stability and security of so many as his majesty ’s loyal opposition our priority will be to work with the government but also to challenge and scrutinise they as need ultimately we can assure the government that we will always work in the national interest because it be foreign policy that keep our people safe at home and that be our foremost duty 
 i be grateful to the hon member for her remark and for her work previously on the foreign affairs committee in which she be a stalwart champion for international humanitarian law she raise these issue frequently in the house challenge both side on the issue she think be important and i be pleased to see she elevate to this position i be grateful for the work that i be able to do with the former foreign secretary lord cameron and the way in which he keep we in opposition in those day up to date with what be happen in our national interest i also thank the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell for all his work when he be in office particularly on the issue of development 
 the hon member ask i about the safety of the hostage that be of primary concern of course we be engage in detailed conversation with prime minister netanyahu on what support we can offer to assist in the business of get those hostage out i meet hostage family many of they uk hostage family to discuss   the plight of those hostage they remain paramount in the government ’s mind as we head i hope towards the ceasefire that we all want 
 the hon member be right to centre her remark on the question of aid truck a day when we know there should be be not enough the whole house recognise the word flood and we be tell in april that gaza would be flood with aid truck be nowhere near enough as a consequence we hear story of disease now include polio set in which be horrific and trouble we all deeply 
 let i reassure the hon member that we allocate an extra £ to support uk med in gaza because those field site be so important against a backdrop in which hospital and medical facility have be pummel and bomb into the ground she be right to focus on the biden plan which we would like to see adopt in the next few day the plan dominate discussion with g7 foreign ministers in washington dc last week and the conversation i have have with arab partner and all of we want to see the deal do i sincerely hope that we get to that point by the end of the month 
 there be a sticking point with prisoner release as well as with hostage release what happen on the day after israel ’s security be paramount hamas can not remain in charge of gaza but equally the israel defence forces can not remain situated in gaza there have to be a new paradigm it will involve i suspect arab partner and other who can give security guarantee to israel it be a complicated picture we have to work at pace on what come afterwards 
 the hon member be right to raise the terrible situation on the west bank it be important for i to meet the new prime minister on the west bank to discuss the finance that have be withdraw and the febrile situation we see against a backdrop of an unbelievable expansion which breach international law that the house stand by i press the israeli prime minister on that issue greatly we be of course look closely at those issue 
 on the role that iran play in sponsor hamas sponsor hezbollah and engage in malign activity we keep a close eye i stand by what i say at the dispatch box when i be opposition spokesman on these matter and i will work over the come month to review the context of terrorist activity and state threat with the home secretary 
 i welcome my right hon friend to his position what discussion have he have on a deal to secure the release of the hostage can he inform the house of the welfare of the remain hostage 
 it have now be many month indeed and it be sadly possible that some of the hostage be no long alive there be report that some have lose their life i have speak to hostage family aware that in this case their son may no long be with we of course like any parent they want the body return there be also hostage still in tunnel and their parent brother sister and family be unaware of their health at this point in time we will continue to do all we can work with the israeli authority and with nation   such as qatar that importantly be able to speak to hamas in a way that this government can not in order to ensure their release 
 i welcome the foreign secretary to his place 
 the situation in gaza be frankly soul shatter it have be nearly day and the death toll stand at with the vast majority of those kill be woman and child only day ago people lose their life in a strike on a un run school the attack on or near a school in the last day those who survive the bombing be at severe risk of disease and malnutrition against the backdrop of a medical system that have be completely decimate i warmly welcome the restoration of funding to unrwa as a backbone of gazan society but the number of death will only increase exponentially now that polio have be find the lancet estimate that the number might reach 
 this have to end now we need an immediate ceasefire but we also need the hostage out and the aid in it be also right that we should start think about not just the next day but how we stop this ever happen again there be only viable answer which be a state solution that be our north star and it be the keystone to stability in the region 
 i have to express disappointment that the foreign secretary refuse to pull the lever that would well signify our commitment to a state solution which be to recognise the palestinian state on border ireland spain and norway do it in may will he consider it if not why not prime minister netanyahu of israel actively reject a palestinian state and we know that the fact a palestinian state do not exist be hamas ’s rallying cry we must prove they wrong so what be the foreign secretary do to ensure that it happen 
 the icc have issue arrest warrant for netanyahu gallant and hamas leader but there be confusion about the foreign secretary ’s position on the block will he clarify that for the house today finally will he consider meet i so that we can work together across the house to advance the cause of an immediate ceasefire and most importantly an endure peace and a state solution 
 i be grateful to the hon lady not just for her remark but for how she take up these issue in the last parliament which i be sure she will continue in this parliament we be all remind of her family ’s plight in gaza particularly in those early month i welcome her support for restore funding to unrwa many of our ally make that decision month ago back in april and may and i be sorry that it have take a change of government to look at it clearly and reach this point she be absolutely right to raise the huge concern about polio now take hold in gaza alongside the tremendous growth in respiratory disease and diarrhoea which can both lead to death if untreated 
 there be no confusion on this party ’s position on palestinian recognition we be committed to palestinian recognition we hope to work with partner to achieve that when the circumstance be right i say to the hon lady that it be my sincere hope that the biden plan be adopt in the come week and that we get the immediate ceasefire that this party have be call   for it be now a good almost month since we have be call for an immediate ceasefire under those circumstance we can work with other because palestinian recognition be not the end in and of itself it be actually a state solution that be the end that we want to achieve 
 the hon lady be right that the chief prosecutor at the icc have make his intention clear in relation to arrest warrant but she will know that there be further hearing to determine whether they will actually be issue we have be week in office it be right that i allow treasury solicitor lawyer and the attorney general to assist i in any judgment that we have to make in relation to that i say in my statement that there be a process it be a quasi legal process that must be follow with all integrity and i intend to do that 
 i welcome the foreign secretary ’s statement it be a real relief particularly his description of the hell hole that be gaza many of my constituent in rochdale feel deeply appal by the ongoing death and suffering of the palestinian people in gaza but they be also deeply appal by the rise tide of settler violence and expansion in the west bank many of they be desperate for peace in the region as be many of we in this house today what specific step be the foreign secretary take to actively promote and uphold the independence of the international criminal court and the international court of justice 
 i welcome my hon friend to his place it be great to see he here i know he long hold an ambition to move from journalism to this house we be clear that the international criminal court be the primary international institution for investigate and prosecute the most serious international crime we fully respect the rule base order and the icc ’s independence and impartiality we be aware that the icj be likely to issue an advisory opinion shortly and we will consider it very carefully 
 i welcome the right hon member to his role member on both side of the house want to see critical aid get through where it be need but i be concern by the government ’s decision to resume funding to unrwa unrwa school have be repeatedly use by terrorist both to store weapon and to launch attack and over unrwa staff have have link to terrorist group in the region be the right hon gentleman able to give uk taxpayer an unequivocal assurance that hamas have no link to unrwa in gaza 
 i have the pleasure of meet catherine colonna in her role as the foreign secretary of france she be a woman of tremendous capability and integrity she look at these issue in depth she report and all our ally have continue to fund unrwa she do make a series of recommendation that be why i speak to the un secretary general and to commissioner general lazzarini who be responsible for unrwa to ensure that they be implement the action plan that come out as a consequence of that review in find the money available for unrwa and restore its funding i have also ensure that there be £ of funding to support the implementation of those recommendation 
 i thank the foreign secretary for his work on move government policy on this issue and for put the situation in gaza at the top of his agenda in particular i commend the fact that he and the prime minister have consistently call for international law to be follow in the conflict when will he publish the government ’s assessment of whether any party have breach international law since   october   and what the consequence of any such breach should be 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that question i know that he have champion the palestinian cause and the palestinian people in this house for many many year he push i on an important subject may i say to he he be an esteemed lawyer so he understand why i be choose my word carefully that this be a quasi legal process and it be important that i follow the action in the appropriate way with all probity and integrity i will consider those assessment when they be make available to i i instigate a process on my day in office i be support in that by our attorney general and i hope to be able to make my view know with full accountability and transparency 
 i welcome the foreign secretary to his place and i welcome the decision to restore unrwa funding and the overall change of tone from his predecessor on this issue the liberal democrats have long call for arm sale to israel to be suspend while there be question over its human right record as shadow foreign secretary he call on the conservative government to publish the legal advice that they have receive on this matter will he commit to do so now 
 the hon lady will have hear what be just say to my hon friend the member for hammersmith and fulham—[interruption the boundary have change and he be now my hon friend   the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter hammersmith have go more upmarket interruption member will understand that as the member for tottenham i think that i can get away with that 
 in all seriousness because this be a very serious point i will seek to make my decision with full accountability and transparency 
 i welcome the foreign secretary ’s announcement on unrwa whose work i know well it save life in the face of unbearable horror and we must be careful about believe any misinformation about its work 
 early this year in of the only hospital still function in gaza i meet a mother whose child have be injure by an israeli airstrike with almost kill she ask i to tell the world what be be do to the palestinians of gaza she assume that we do not know because if we know surely we would have act to stop it do the foreign secretary agree that as well as an immediate and lasting ceasefire accountability be essential in uphold international law and that the international criminal court and international court of justice be do vital work on israel and the occupied palestinian territories that must be support and act on will he meet i to discuss those issue 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question many in this house will know of her considerable work and the work of her colleague on behalf of those suffering in gaza over the past few month they will also know just how hard and unbearable it have be for many many of those work on the ground 
 my hon friend make an important statement about the independence of the work of the icc and the icj i believe in the separation of power as i think do all democrats in this house it be for judge and the judiciary to have the time to reflect and make their consideration and for politician to step back and respect they in that process that be the case in our own country and it must be the case in international court of law of course i will meet my hon friend and other colleague and keep they update 
 i welcome the foreign secretary and his team to their place i also welcome the statement in particular the emphasis on the need for an immediate ceasefire for the immediate release of all hostage and for a stop to settler violence and expansion in the west bank i welcome the resumption of funding to unrwa 
 i add my voice to the call that a couple of hon member have make for the foreign secretary to commit to publish the comprehensive review of israel ’s compliance or non compliance with international humanitarian law as soon as official have complete it in the meantime will he apply the precautionary principle and act to stop all uk arm export to israel give the already widespread evidence of considerable breach of international law 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her remark i welcome she the green party ’s representative for north herefordshire to the house 
 as i say in my remark this be of the tough neighbourhood in the world israel be surround by people who would see its annihilation it be be attack by the houthis hezbollah be fire missile and hamas want to wipe it off the map for those reason it would not be right to have a blanket ban between our country and israel what be right be for i to consider in the normal way the issue in relation to offensive weapon in gaza follow the quasi judicial process that i have outline 
 i welcome my right hon friend to his place and congratulate he on behalf of my constituent in warwick and leamington on give priority to this issue i commend he for today ’s announcement the restoration of funding to unrwa be long overdue as we have hear many other nation do this many month ago give its importance in the supply of of aid and of food into gaza the truck a day we have hear about be way insufficient an estimate be need 
 my right hon friend may be aware of the oxfam report show that the idf have almost systematically weaponise water in gaza there have be a reduction in the water supply to just litre per person per day my right hon friend speak about dysentery and polio what do he believe the uk can do to assist the restoration of the water supply in gaza 
 i be grateful for my hon friend ’s continued championing of these issue he be right to mention the importance of water i think it be now half a people who be at category the definition that constitute starvation and famine and in large part that be due to there be no access to clean water he know of the scene of sewage get into the system the lack of clean water be a desperate situation in the end what we need be a ceasefire because only with a ceasefire can reconstruction work begin 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to speak of the need for an immediate ceasefire and the need to restore funding to unrwa i welcome both those move he also speak of the government ’s need to make an assessment of israeli compliance with international humanitarian law in gaza but the question then arise after that assessment have be make what be go to happen he say in his statement that the horror must end now and indeed it must but he have just explain to   the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns   that to cease supply arm to israel would cause as he see it a great problem what be the leverage that he have if the horror must end now and it must then this government must be able to take some action once they have review and receive the legal assessment that he have call for i be prepared to give he time to get that assessment but i want to know what he be go to do once he have get it 
 my hon friend be very experienced experience enough to know that the minute any individual describe their leverage that leverage be lose therefore if he will forgive i i will not share that at the dispatch box at this stage however the passion that lie behind his question be a concern that for month foreign secretaries have stand at this dispatch box and say that the aid must get in and that we must follow international humanitarian law and now month later there be a new foreign secretary at the dispatch box and there be still serious concern about international humanitarian law and the aid have simply not get in in the quantity need he share my frustration and it be frustration indeed that i share with leader in israel 
 i call emily darlington 
 i be sorry mr deputy speaker i be not bob but i be happy to ask a question be you sure it be i you be call on 
 please go ahead the clerks be struggle a bit with new member 
 i congratulate my right hon friend and his entire team on their position and thank he for the restoration of funding to unrwa as someone who have work in international development i have see the vital work those organisation play and in particular those organisation under the united nations umbrella because they be where we can come together as an international force do he agree that the solution in the israel palestine conflict be not necessarily solution here in parliament but solution that we will have to work with our international partner to build 
 my hon friend have get off to a good start she be right because we have see so many aid worker lose their life and secondly because her emphasis on the partnership that we have to strike with ally across the world be essential if we be to see the change that we need particularly in gaza but also in the occupied territories 
 it be very welcome to see the secretary of state and his team on the front bench as britain ’s voice in the world that have a particular significance for i as of my predecessor in the livingston constituency be robin cook i know robin cook ’s time in office and his thinking do much to inform the secretary of state ’s approach to his new role this statement be incredibly welcome although it set out the horrific situation on the ground in gaza do the secretary of state agree that there be no peace without a state solution and that oppose a state solution be wrong for both israelis and the palestinian people 
 i be very grateful to have be ask a question by the new occupant of robin cook ’s seat he be a stalwart and a champion of this cause i be grateful to come into this house when he be serve as foreign secretary and in an article i write recently in foreign affairs i pay tribute to his work over many year 
 the vote by the knesset yesterday be hugely disappointing we believe passionately in state i say to those who reject state if you be a proponent of state you have to explain how everyone enjoy equality under the law and if you be a proponent of no state you be effectively suggest that occupation continue that be unacceptable i would have think to all member of this house 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on become foreign secretary and i welcome his statement outline the restoration of unrwa funding for which labour member have be call for a long time he will remember that many of we have raise the issue of humanitarian aid we meet many aid organisation throughout the last parliament include islamic relief which be base in my constituency who tell i day after   october the harrowing story of lose contact with all their staff on the ground we know that blockade and restriction be key issue so will he outline how they will be lift so that urgent aid can get to the people who need it 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question and may i congratulate she on her remarkable speech at the beginning of the debate on the address she have also raise these issue before we certainly share a christian faith and have talk about our deep concern as people of faith and i pay tribute to islamic relief for its work issue be that rafah be now close and it need to reopen another issue be not just the truck get across but the distribution once they be there very sadly the picture that be now be paint be of lawlessness in gaza widespread looting from the truck that get across and very sadly a driver lose his life yesterday her question be as the people of vauxhall and camberwell green would say on point 
 i welcome my right hon friend to his position and the restoration of funding to unrwa it be good to see that when we talk about change at the election we also mean in the international approach of the government i know that he will share the house ’s revulsion at the ongoing horror face by hostage their family and the innocent civilian in gaza face this endure crisis that revulsion be share by many people in my peterborough constituency it be a privilege to be a voice for they in call for a ceasefire the release of hostage peace and a complete solution to recognise palestine what message would he send to constituent of mine who have for too long hear discussion about a state solution to say that this time with a new government we have a new approach to deal with the immediate crisis and achieve the recognition of palestine 
 my hon friend know that i know peterborough very well have spend year of my life in that great cathedral city i have knock on door with he and know that this be an issue of great concern there we be absolutely committed to the state solution the global community have for too many year talk about it but not act and i recognise that there be now almost tremendous cynicism when that phrase be use but there be no way out of this crisis without a plan for afterwards that plan must of course guarantee the security of israel but the palestinian cause be a just cause and we must work with arab partner and build up the palestinian authority i speak to they at length about what more we can do to assist they with the reform that they need to make so that we can realise that my hon friend be absolutely right to put on record our deep concern for the hostage their family and their plight if they be release we could end this now 
 i warmly welcome my right hon friend to his position as the labour foreign secretary for year which be very welcome do he agree that the uk ’s extensive long stand diplomatic economic cultural and defence tie with the gulf arab and other middle eastern government mean that we be well place to bring our influence to bear and work in co operation with our international partner in order to achieve a state solution that ensure a safe and secure israel and a viable sovereign and day we hope prosperous palestinian state can he also assure i that all will be do to enable british organisation and company to play their full role in rebuild gaza ’s infrastructure and economy 
 i say to my hon friend the new member for rugby that that be a very good question that be why in opposition i spend so much time with partner in the region talk to they about the future all of they want to be engage want peace and want to move towards a process of normalisation but they be all crystal clear that that can not happen by ignore the plight of the palestinian people or without set up a   road map to state they be not prepared to reconstruct gaza for this to happen yet again in year time so we have to work with they they play a critical role but we must now get that immediate ceasefire 
 i welcome the foreign secretary and his team to their place and strongly welcome the decision announce today to restore funding for unrwa which will be recognise by many people in south birmingham as an important step among many other towards end the horror that we see today in gaza the israeli government ’s decision to end the legal route for palestinians to work in israel have play an important role in the entrenchment of poverty and political instability in the west bank alongside the illegal settlement programme will the foreign secretary make representation on this important matter recognise that both the israeli histadrut and the palestinian general federation of trade unions as pillar of civil society in both nation have an important role to play in the establishment of a last peace

 most gracious sovereign 
 we your majesty ’s most dutiful and loyal subject the commons of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in parliament assemble beg leave to offer our humble thank to your majesty for the gracious speech which your majesty have address to both houses of parliament 
 it be an honour to open today ’s king ’s speech debate on behalf of his majesty ’s government and it be the honour of my life to address the house for the time as the deputy prime minister 
 we have be give a mandate by the british people to turn the page on year of chaos and start the new chapter that they deserve that begin with this week ’s king ’s speech but it be not the word that we offer it be the action i know at hand how government can change life for the well i say that not as a politician but as someone whose life be change for the well by the last labour government and i be determined to do the same for other that be why we have set out a bold vision to smash the class ceiling to get britain building and to improve the quality and standard of life for everyone everywhere across our country 
 let i give a huge welcome to all the new member on the government benches who be crucial in deliver that programme of national renewal i also extend a welcome to new opposition members we will disagree on much i be sure but we all share the honour and privilege of represent those who send we here so i wish the very good to all hon member make their maiden speech today 
 just over year ago when i make my maiden speech on behalf of the people of ashton under lyne i pledge that i would always tell it as it be and i think that be promise i have keep now i intend to fulfil another because we promise the people of this country that we will serve their interest and not ours that start with we have the honesty to say that we will not be able to put right the mess of the past year immediately but after just week we have already make a difference by create a national wealth fund to grow our economy scrap the fail rwanda plan lift the near decade long ban on onshore wind start work on the extra nhs appointment that people need each week and on get the urgent dental appointment up and run and resume and expand teacher recruitment in my department newly rename the ministry of housing communities and local government we will replace slogan with substance 
 we be get back to the real work of govern in the national interest we have already take early step to unblock our planning system create a new taskforce    to accelerate progress on stall housing site in our country begin with that alone could deliver more than of the home that britain so desperately need the housing crisis be hold britain back too many family face soar mortgage payment or sky high rent for damp unsafe home and there be leaseholder who be trap face eye watering charge with no way out all this have be fuel by the chronic housing shortage after the last government fail to meet their housing target every single year housing completion be now set to hit their low level since world war 
 we know we have a mountain to climb that be why we be already take the step start with an overhaul of our planning system a reform that will help we build the home we need and speed up provision of the infrastructure to support they we be commit not just to an ambitious target for overall housing building but to build the big wave of social and affordable housing for a generation that be a promise that we will bring back with meaningful housing target 
 it be right that local people have a say on what kind of house be build and where because our aim be not to build big but to build well we will work with local government to plan new housing in the good possible place with the infrastructure public service and green space they need social housing must be there when people need it and affordable housing to own should be there when they want it 
 i congratulate the deputy prime minister on her new role my local council in south staffordshire and dudley have work hard to prepare local plan that provide the housing they have assess that the local community need while also protect key green belt will the right hon lady really tear up plan that have be adopt or that be in the formal process of be adopt if her bureaucrat feel that their assessment be well than the local council ’s 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s comment and i congratulate the local authority that have those local plan if those plan be adopt that be exactly what we want to see we want to see more local plan and more engagement with local leader so that we can build the house that people want in their area work together with they the hon gentleman talk about the green belt but we have be very clear on the grey belt as well we will not get the housing we need just from brownfield site although brownfield will be we will work with local leader because the mandate the british people give we at this election be to get the housing that britain need i be afraid that the last tory government do not take this issue on but fail people and we have a chronic housing shortage everyone should have a place to call home and we will legislate to make that happen 
 our renter right bill will give protection and security to tenant as well as responsible landlord level the playing field we will plug the gap leave by the last government ’s leasehold and freehold reform act tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent and strengthen leaseholder right our planning and infrastructure bill will provide the extra home we need unblock stall development site and unveil the next generation of new town 
 my constituency have vast swathe of high risk flood area zone and and we see flooding every year we see it most notably in but also in january will the right hon lady ’s planning reform protect area at high risk of flooding so that they be not build on make our flooding bad 
 order we have a lot of speaker to get through include some maiden speaker so i urge front benchers to make short speech and take few intervention otherwise we be not go to get through these maiden speaker 
 thank you mr deputy speaker i will take your advice and i apologise to member for the fact that i will not take more intervention 
 we have to grapple with these issue and work with those in these area obviously flooding have be a major issue and the government will look at it it be devastating to people when their home be flood and we have to look at these thing in the round when look at plan 
 we will unveil the next generation of new town and we will learn the lesson of the past to create safe and beautiful home and the sustainable green community of the future this government be fully commit to the target set under the environment act and we will work closely with my right hon friend the environment secretary to ensure that we protect the environment and nature we will work with local leader to ensure that these town meet our gold standard of have genuinely affordable housing with home for social rent a priority in some place we will extend urban area and regenerate they so that everyone benefit from well public transport and extra public service we be build not just home but community
