the hon gentleman articulate the case against labour run wales with great power there be £ on top of the £ that we already spend on nhs dentistry in england 
 we have finite resource as i have say this be additional money i have prioritise dentistry across the board but this be £ of additional money in addition to the £ that we spend in england 
 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what recent step she have take with cabinet colleague to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 tackle violence against woman and girl be of the government ’s key priority we be make progress in deliver various cross government workstream include the tackle violence against woman and girl strategy and the rape review action plan 
 quarter of police record domestic abuse case be close due to evidential difficulty or because the victim do not support further action do the minister agree that labour ’s proposal to put rape and domestic abuse specialist in every police force in england and wales will give woman the confidence to come forward and secure more conviction 
 we will have rape specialist across all police force by april in the autumn statement the prime minister announce that the government would provide £ of additional funding for a flexible fund that trial off payment to victim of domestic abuse that fund be make available to victim on   january 
 last week i co host an event here in parliament with a delegation from israel who have hand experience of the aftermath of   october they describe innocent woman dead or alive who have be rap by terrorist hamas desecrate their body and even booby trap they those act of sexual violence must be condemn by every institution and individual who care about woman ’s right 
 i thank my hon friend and her co chair for organise what be for attendee an extremely difficult meeting we hear the harrowing account of witness and family member of young girl who be kidnap on   october and we hear from the responder who find the body of woman and girl of all age with obvious sign of sexual violence female   soldier be find naked with nail and sharp object shove into their vaginas tell of a mother he find with her hand tie behind her back naked and bleed from the waist down shoot in the back of the head and with a live grenade leave in her hand for whoever find her body 
 we must support the courage of those witness in give that harrowing testimony about hamas ’s mass scale perpetration of sexual violence on   october we can not be silent about these atrocity we must ensure that the world do not forget that sexual violence shatter life and devastate community the uk stand in solidarity with survivor and continue to call for the release of the remain hostage 
 i appreciate that the government have be try to tackle violence against woman and girl specifically with the domestic abuse act unfortunately amendment that would have go far to protect migrant woman who too often still feel unable to come forward and report abuse for fear of their datum be share and their be detain or deport be not accept will the minister commit to reassess the merit of prevent survivor personal datum from be share with the home office for immigration purpose 
 that be a matter for the home office i support all the work that home office ministers be do to tackle domestic abuse and i know there would have be good reason for not accept those amendment to the act we will continue to do all we can i have just hear from the minister for safeguard the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for newbury laura farris that concession be be make we will continue to work with she and other to tackle domestic violence in all its form 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 in some instance there be good reason why immigration control should be able to work with force of law enforcement when it come to domestic abuse my constituent emma have be serially abuse harass and stalk by a us national who cross the border with no visa he do not need to continue his campaign of harassment will my right hon friend please work closely with the home office to ensure that british woman be protect from foreign abuser who have find way around our immigration system 
 my right hon friend be right to raise that i ask she to let her constituent know that the government be do all they can the safeguarding minister have say that she will write to my right hon friend so that this specific case can be far investigate 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for the home department on the time take to process claim to the windrush compensation scheme 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for the home department on the time take to process claim to the windrush compensation scheme 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for the home department on the time take to process claim to the windrush compensation scheme 
 as of december of all claim either have receive a final decision or be less than month old the windrush scheme have reduce the time take to allocate a substantive casework decision from month to less than month that include make all essential eligibility check together with a preliminary assessment to make an initial interim payment of £ wherever possible 
 in response to a parliamentary question the former immigration minister   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick confirm that by april last year of the windrush compensation claimant have sadly die before their claim be settle an increase of more than since will the minister update we on how many applicant have now die while wait for the government to right the wrong do to thousand of innocent survivor and their family 
 i can confirm that we have be make aware of claimant who have unfortunately pass away i want to provide the hon lady with reassurance if we be notify an individual be suffer from a critical or life limit illness their claim be prioritise secondly if they do pass away their family be still able to pursue their claim 
 only of eligible applicant to the compensation scheme have receive redress will the government learn lesson from the horizon scandal and listen to victim and campaign group who be call on they to lower the burden of proof for claim and ensure that legal aid be guarantee to all eligible claimant 
 so far £ have be pay out on more than claim i gently say to the hon gentleman that it be not appropriate to draw precise equivalence with thing like the horizon scheme because that involve a judicial process with different fact different loss and different harm however we have be make consistent improvement to the compensation scheme include make it easy for applicant to use and we have rapidly accelerate the speed at which we make our payment 
 victim of the windrush scandal have experience huge injustice of destitution humiliation and varied health issue as well as delay in receive compensation to make matter bad they do not currently receive compensation for the loss of private pension will the minister look into reduce the delay and compensate windrush victim for private pension loss 
 we consider each claim on its fact and no claim be the same i would be happy to write to the hon lady about specific issue but i reassure she that we do not take a blanket approach to each individual and we assess claim individually 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities 
 the conservatives have fail the windrush generation twice now by deny their right as british citizen and secondly by delay their compensation as we have just hear again labour would sort out the compensation scheme re establish the major change programme and windrush unit scrap by the conservatives and appoint a windrush commissioner to ensure that this kind of scandal never happen again what be the government ’s plan here 
 i find it difficult to accept that a scheme be fail when more than of claim have now receive a final decision and more than have either receive a final decision or be less than month old so i disagree with that i think it be suggest that we should take the scheme out of the home office perhaps that be labour ’s proposal i remind the hon lady that martin levermore the independent adviser to the windrush scheme support the scheme remain in the home office in his most recent report publish in march 
 there be no accountability for the failure be feel so acutely by so many people who frankly do not have much time leave to see justice the windrush generation and their family help to build our nhs but today we see big inequality in health outcome labour ’s race equality act would include a target to close the appalling maternal mortality gap for black and asian woman it seem another month have pass since the maternity disparity taskforce last meet be that because the minister for women and equalities think this be another of her allege fake problem 
 i say to the hon lady that that be not accept in fact the health secretary make an announcement on maternal service this week i think it would be appropriate to refer to my colleague at the department of health and social care and then i will write to the hon lady on this point 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the domestic abuse commissioner on take step to help tackle so call honour base abuse 
 i meet the domestic abuse commissioner regularly and our last joint visit be to a refuge for minoritise woman for whom honour base abuse be a specific issue it be important work of the home office to look at the specific harm connect with this issue of the thing we be most proud of be our forced marriage unit which have provide support service to more than case in the past year we also fund a national honour base abuse helpline which have help more than people in the past month 
 savera uk which be base in my constituency and the domestic abuse commissioner be concern by this government ’s failure to provide a statutory definition of so call honour base abuse do the minister agree that that will lead to under reporting and a lack of detail on the scale of the problem 
 i be afraid that the government take the opposite view we use the expression honour base abuse which have be controversial in itself because often victim understand it the good victim of honour base abuse be often the hard to reach and sometimes be the least able to articulate their claim and to escape their circumstance we keep the definition wide to capture successfully all the various insidious form that it take let i reassure the hon lady that both the crown prosecution service and the home office use a work definition to guide investigation and so far it be prove effective 
 of the most insidious form of domestic abuse be conversion therapy it be cruel and it do not work could my hon friend give i some indication of when legislation will come forward to ban it 
 i can reassure my hon friend that the government will publish a draft bill on that in due course 
 what step she be take to help support woman into science technology engineering and mathematic job 
 we be help to get young girl and woman into stem sector in key way by increase the number of young girl take up course we have see a increase in the number of undergraduate stem course take up by young woman secondly this week be national apprenticeship week and of job be now access through an apprenticeship which be help young woman get into stem career thirdly we be help woman with experience of work in stem who have leave the profession to return to the workplace with our stem returner project 
 university technical college be a good place for young woman to start in stem i welcome the new utc in southampton which will provide the extra place that portsmouth utc be unable to offer some girl attend utcs around the country of whom go on to apprenticeship university or straight into employment mostly into stem career do my hon friend agree that utcs provide a great start to a career in stem and that the proposal for utc sleeve in secondary school will help more girl into stem career 
 i absolutely agree university technical college provide an excellent experience for young people not just academically but in provide technical skill they have excellent link with industry which provide great work experience for those pupil i be pleased that the young people in my hon friend ’s constituency have such great option for utc provision 
 i be always encourage by the number of young lady and girl who wish to be involve in science technology and mathematic in northern ireland they can do the job every bit as well man be it not important to ensure that company that wish to employ people do more to encourage young lady to take up job 
 the hon member be absolutely right the government can not do it all we need industry and there be some great example we have a £ scholarship programme for artificial intelligence and datum science conversion course we also have the uk space agency invest £ into diverse workforce stream particularly to help young woman get into the sector he be right that we need to work hand in glove with industry 
 what step the government be take to help support woman with caring responsibility to continue work 
 we all know that woman take on the bulk of care responsibility the carer ’s leave regulations will come into force on   april   across england wales and scotland allow carer to take a week of unpaid leave from the workplace know that their job be protect 
 the ministerial team know that it be an absolute scandal that in all these year of so call popular conservative government we have see such a bad deal for early year carer and talented woman legion of they want to use their talent at work but be stop by the high childcare cost in the world 
 i would respectfully say to the hon gentleman that god give we ear and a mouth for a reason and i would encourage he to put his listening ear on to hear about the track record of this government we have for instance improve payment for carer introduce groundbreake legislation to allow flexible working from day and legislate for parental leave include share parental leave and paternity leave the kinship care strategy be launch in december to provide a funding model for kinship carer we have go far than any government with our plan to improve the life of carer and value the work that they do 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 that right to flexible working would particularly benefit worker with caring responsibility most of whom be woman but unfortunately the uk government ’s response to the result of their consultation on flexible working simply do not go far enough to provide some of the real practical support need by many people with such responsibility last week nikki pound of the tuc tell the women and equalities committee that in request for flexible working be deny by employer what step be the uk government take to give real support to worker with caring responsibility and ensure that flexible working be a day right by default 
 i be a carer myself hold down a full time job so i be aware of the difficulty involve as i have say the government have pass legislation allow flexible work from day and we have also introduce week of leave entitlement for parent that be on top of the carer ’s leave regulations which will come into force on   april we have go far than any other government in introduce those right for carer 
 if she will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of government support for energy bill on disabled people 
 the government understand the importance of this issue i have recently meet key stakeholder represent disabled people include member of disability uk and cross whitehall colleague 
 my constituent mr peter bodek have a severe lung condition which necessitate the use of oxygen there be mould in his house and it be get on to his clothe he can only afford small electric heater i should be grateful if a minister could meet i very briefly to discuss this rather difficult situation 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that issue and i speak both for myself and on behalf of the minister for disabled people health and work in say that of course we will have a meeting 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 in the light of some of the commentary about the employment tribunal ’s judgment in the case of professor miller and bristol university i want to clarify the fact that antisemitism must continue to be challenge wherever it arise we have see people in this country use their view on israel as an excuse to display antisemitism we have see that in protest on our street and also in our university it be therefore important to stress that this ruling do not change the fact that while academic have the right to express view they can not behave in a way that amount to harassment of jewish student disguise that as discourse about israel would be no more lawful than any other form of antisemitism the government will consider the ruling carefully and we will continue to do all in our power to protect jewish people throughout our country 
 on monday my hon friend   the member for livingston hannah bardell   host a very positive event mark the start of the football v. homophobia month of action will ministers join i in thank all those involve in the campaign which include leap sport and the tie campaign in scotland and offer their wholehearte support for make football a safe and welcome sport for lgbt people 
 of course we join the hon gentleman in that i pay tribute to the work of the minister for equalities who have be very supportive of the campaign as be all of we in the ministerial team 
 i hear more frequent use of the word microaggression as an engineer i know that micro mean something extremely small it be tiny in fact it be of whatever a standard aggression might be have the minister a view on this and do she recognise it as a new phenomenon how big a priority might it be 
 as my hon friend will know i too be an engineer by training and we engineer have to stick together we be very sceptical when people introduce to the lexicon term that be not helpful to the real work of tackle serious criminal behaviour i be not a fan of that term and my hon friend will be pleased to know that microaggression training be remove from the government campus prospectus in november 
 i call the shadow minister 
 under the conservatives police record rape have soar to record high while conviction have fall to record low it emerge last week that the conservative police and crime commissioner in cheshire victim blame girl wear short skirt for this epidemic why be these attitude still tolerate in the conservative party 
 those attitude be not tolerate in the conservative party i have not see the remark the hon lady refer to but i be sure that we can investigate however i will push back on what she say about rape statistic the fact be that for the year end march the crime survey for england and wales show a reduction in the number of adult experience domestic abuse a statistically significant decrease compare with the year end march 
 last month i receive a letter from my local nhs trust regard child ’s service at southend hospital it refer to woman and birth people go into labour can my right hon friend clarify whether the term birth people be require language under the equality act if not do she agree that it should not be use because it be dehumanising confusing and insult to many woman 
 this conservative government and this conservative prime minister have be clear that biological sex matter and language be important too we have issue guidance to trust because there be evidence that clinical damage and harm can come with the removal of the use of the term woman from literature i would be happy to write to my hon friend ’s local trust to point that out 
 scope have note that potential change to the work capability assessment might force disabled people into ill suited employment and it be worried that huge number of people will end up be force into do exactly that what step be the minister taking with her cabinet colleague to ensure that disabled people be not force into job that be not suit to they 
 the hon lady join i yesterday at the disability action plan event where many stakeholder welcome the change and opportunity in disabled people ’s life many disabled people want to work and we at the department for work and pensions will always ensure that we listen to their want and need and that they will never be force into anything that be not suitable for they 
 at pm today woman ’s group and other community group in gosport will be stag a peaceful protest about the lib dem council ’s decision to completely end all live cctv monitoring they be worried about the impact on people ’s safety do the minister agree with they

 will the uk government redouble their effort to ensure that the humanitarian need of woman and girl in gaza be be address in line with the uk ’s commitment under the international woman and girl strategy the woman peace and security national action plan and the international development white paper 
 i be work closely with the foreign commonwealth and development office on this issue we be very concerned about the event take place in both israel and gaza and we want to see the violence end the hon gentleman will know about all the work we have be do on prevent sexual violence in conflict for example and we will continue to do everything we can to minimise any impact on woman and girl

 afterwards it be brief that these word have not be sign off by no do the prime minister agree with his foreign secretary 
 our long stand position have be that we will recognise a palestinian state at a time that be most conducive to the peace process the most important thing be that we be committed to that state solution and be work with our ally to bring it about 
 people in northampton south be desperately short of nhs dental provision indeed in duston there be now none at all so today ’s dentistry recovery plan announcement be hugely welcome but can the prime minister guarantee to my resident that there will be improvement within month not year 
 we be publish the dentistry recovery plan today and my right hon friend the health secretary will be make a statement shortly over more people see an nhs dentist last year than the year before but we know that there be more to do that be why the recovery plan will make sure that nhs dental care be fast simple and fair for patient and staff 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i join the prime minister in send his majesty the king our very good wish for his treatment across the house we all look forward to see he back to full health as quickly as possible 
 this week the unwavering bravery of brianna ghey ’s mother esther have touch we all as a father i can not even imagine the pain that she be go through i be glad that she be with we in the gallery today 
 a year ago the prime minister promise to bring down nhs waiting list be n’t he glad that he do not bet a grand on it 
 at least i stand by my commitment he be so indecisive that the only bet he would make be an each way bet 
 he say he stand by his commitment he once insist that if he miss his promise 
 i ’m the prime minister it ’s on i personally 
 today we learn from his own official that he be the blocker to any deal to end the doctor strike every time he be ask he blame everyone else what exactly do he mean when he say it ’ on i personally if he do not meet his promise 
 we be bring down waiting list for the long waiter and make progress it be a bit rich to hear about promise from someone who have break every single promise he be elect on i have count almost in the last year pension planning peerage public sector pay tuition fee childcare referendum define a woman although in fairness that be only of a u turn the list go on but the theme be the same empty word broken promise and absolutely no plan 
 of all the week to say that when brianna ’s mother be in this chamber shame parade as a man of integrity when he have get absolutely no responsibility it be absolute—[interruption 
 order i think member be get carry away our constituent want to hear the question and they certainly want to hear the answer they do not want to hear organise barracking so please i want no more of it 
 i think the role of the prime minister be to ensure that every single citizen in this country feel safe and respected and it be a shame that the prime minister do not share that view i welcome the fact that he have finally admit that he have fail on nhs waiting list i also welcome the fact that he have finally acknowledge the crisis in nhs dentistry he be call it a recovery plan after year of tory government what exactly do he think nhs dentistry be recover from 
 as ever—[interruption 
 order i be certainly not have that from the opposition front bench either please i want to hear this i be hop that election fever be not come tomorrow so let we not behave as though it be 
 as ever the right hon and learn gentleman conveniently forget the impact of a pandemic on nhs dentistry it be specifically because of the close proximity nature of dental provision that it be unable to operate as normal throughout the pandemic that be a recommendation of the medical and clinical expert that be why inevitably there be a backlog in dental care with the impact that this have but that be why as my right hon friend the health secretary will outline later today for the house we be put in more funding to provide more nhs provision across the country on top of plan that will see the number of dental training place increase by our plan mean that there will be more nhs appointment which be in fact time more than the labour party be propose 
 there be some area in the country where people literally can not have an nhs dentist and the prime minister say that that be down to covid people be literally pull out their own teeth—[interruption 
 order let i just say that i do not need any more from those on the government front bench either do we understand each other 
 people be literally pull out their tooth use plier an experience that can be compare with extract an answer from the prime minister at the dispatch box the truth be that after year of neglect this recovery plan be just a desperate attempt to recover back to square if he want to move forward he should follow labour scrap the non dom tax status and use the money to fund more hospital appointment every year but the prime minister be oddly reluctant to follow we on this what exactly be so special about this tax avoidance scheme that mean he prioritise it above the nhs 
 let we look at that record in the nhs we have record funding record number of doctor and nurse a record number of appointment and high cancer survival rate but what be happen on labour ’s watch in wales let we have a look at that a of people in wales be currently on a waiting list the number of wait of month or more be time high than in england and people be wait twice as long for an operation labour ’s failure have send the welsh nhs back to square and we will never let they do that here 
 when the prime minister admit that he have fail on waiting list i actually think that we might be enter a new era of integrity professionalism and accountability”—remember that but just like all the other relaunche it have prove to be a false dawn he be still blame everyone else and be still remove from reality it be very simple you can either back more nhs appointment or more tax avoidance we know what side we be on why do n’t he 
 the good way to ensure that we continue to fund the nhs as we have be not to make £ of unfunded spending commitment just this morning independent treasury official have publish a formal costing of just part of labour ’s eco promise its insulation scheme and it turn out that it will cost double what labour have previously claim it be not the £ that labour account for but £ every single year it be now crystal clear that labour have absolutely no plan but we all know it be go to fund that gap more taxis on hard work people 
 the prime minister be mr tax rise he be literally the country ’s expert on put taxis up and he think he can lecture everyone else on the economy last week he and his mp be laugh at someone whose mortgage have go up £ a month this week he casually make a £ bet in the middle of an interview last week he think even raise question about the cost of living be resort to the politic of envy this week he have finally find the cause he want to rally around the non dom status   when he find himself back tax avoidance over nhs appointment do he start to understand why his own mp be say that he simply do not get what britain need 
 i will take no lecture about get britain from a man who think it be right to defend terrorist what we be do be build a bright future for our country just last week we expand healthcare in pharmacy today we be expand dental care and this week we be help million with the cost of live and most importantly cut national insurance that be all while the labour party argue over different way to raise people ’s taxis that be the difference between we we be deliver a plan but they can not even agree on 
 my constituent and i send our good wish to the king and the royal family 
 despite the popular narrative our economy be do well with an unemployment rate well below the eu average strong inward investment and record employment taxis be high than conservative would like but do my right hon friend agree that a key reason for this be that we rightly spend £ on covid support include of most generous furlough scheme in order to ensure that no be leave behind and that it be our intention and instinct to lower taxis unlike the opposition party 
 my hon friend be right to highlight our record of provide support to the country when it need it whether it be the nhs vaccine furlough during covid or most recently help with people ’s energy bill we be only able to afford that because of the strong management of our economy that be why we must stick with the plan and not risk go back to square with the labour party which as we know have absolutely no plan and will cost everyone in this country with its £ of tax rise 
 i call the leader of the scottish national party 
 i begin by express my heartfelt sympathy to brianna ’s mother who be in the public gallery i also send my good wish to king charles for what will hopefully be a quick and full recovery 
 the public be use to the tories gambling on the life of other boris johnson do it with public health during the pandemic and his immediate successor do it with household finance not to be outdo on monday this week the prime minister accept a crude bet regard the life of asylum seeker in do so he demean they as individual and he degrade the office that he currently hold will he apologise 
 we may have a principled disagreement on this i believe and we believe that if someone come to this country illegally they should not be able to stay and they should be remove that be why we be committed to our rwanda scheme 
 as ever the prime minister do himself no favour because the bet to which i refer be worth £ and it come just hour before he end   cost of live support worth just £ his justification for do so be that the cost of living crisis be ease what do he believe leave he look most out of touch with the public gamble £ or believe that the cost of living crisis be get well 
 the hon gentleman talk about the cost of living but perhaps he can explain to the scottish people why it be that while the uk conservative government be cut their taxis the scottish government be raise they 
 the thought of the people of east worthing and shoreham be with his majesty too 
 the archbishop of canterbury have admit that since take office attendance at the church of england have drop by in the year to covid the number of baptism in the church of england have fall from a year to so christianity in the uk seem to be on the wane unless apparently you be from a muslim country in the middle of an asylum claim we be now tell that in occupant of the bibby stockholm have suddenly become a practise christian give that the church of england have now issue secret guidance to clergy support asylum application for these damascene conversion to whom be the church accountable be taxpayer be scamme by the archbishop 
 when it come to illegal migrant we need to have a system whereby if someone come here illegally they should not be able to stay my right hon friend the home secretary have ask for more information about the extent to which migrant convert to christianity be play a role in our asylum system more generally under our illegal migration act anybody enter the uk illegally will not be grant asylum here that be why we need to have somewhere to send they and why our rwanda scheme be so important the labour party have block these measure every single step of the way because it do not have a plan and it will not keep britain safe 
 may i on behalf of my party extend our good wish to his majesty the king for a full recovery 
 i thank the prime minister for his dedication and leadership in help we to restore our place in the united kingdom and its internal market and to revive our political institution at stormont the union be more secure as a result of our combine endeavour and together we have greatly enhance the potential to build a strong and prosperous economy that will help to cement our peace in northern ireland

 in fact what we be see be record investment in our town across the uk many of which be neglect by the labour party for decade if we really care about level up we need to avoid saddle hard work britons with high taxis which be exactly what labour ’s £ green spending spree would do 
 for year constituent across the vale of glamorgan and the whole of wales sadly have have to wait long to see a doctor long for an ambulance long at a&e and long for an operation than patient in england there be patient in wales wait long than year for an operation the number in england be do my right hon friend agree that aneurin bevan will be turn in his grave over the fact that we can not trust labour with the nhs 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right here in england we have a plan when it come to education where we be march up the league table and we have virtually eliminate the long waiting time but in labour run wales as he say education rate be fall and waiting list over month be more than time high than in england it be crystal clear that we should stick to our plan for a bright future and not go back to square with labour 
 accord to opendemocracy this week since at least people have die at our border that be a rate of more than man or woman per month for year on top of that there be the financial cost the deadly and fail border regime as well as the prime minister ’s plan for rwanda be estimate to have cost at least £ since will he now show that he understand that the people whose life he be make sick bet on be human being and provide they with safe route to the uk in order to seek asylum instead of more failed and extreme form of deterrence 
 it be in fact criminal gang that be exploit vulnerable people and lead many of they to lose their life as they make these dangerous crossing conservative members think that that be wrong and we want to do something about it which be why we need to get a deterrent up and run and be able to send people to rwanda it be the hon gentleman ’s party that oppose that so the question for labour members be why they remain on the side of the criminal people smuggler 
 february mark emotional health boost your self esteem and children ’s mental health month in recent year about people have die in the uk each year due to suicide in i be nearly of they luckily my attempt fail i be find by family member quickly i receive amazing care at st helier and springfield hospitals i do not do any permanent damage and i be well look after by the nhs in the month that follow i want to say thank you to everyone who save i and sorry to my family and loved one whom i put through such an awful ordeal in that moment i feel alone and scar like there be no way out and that the world would be well off without i in it but i do not recognise that man any more i know that nothing be ever really worth that that help really be out there and i be pretty awesome hon member hear hear do the prime minister agree that death by suicide be too many and will he send a message from the dispatch box today that whatever you be go through you be not alone help be out there and well day lie ahead

 may i take this opportunity to ask the prime minister if he will consider apologise to brianna ghey ’s mother for his insensitive comment 
 turn to my question the independent report into teesworks release last monday throw up more question than it answer it be vital that we now have a national audit office investigation the report be scathing and say that there be insufficient transparency to offer evidence of value for money should the government not lead by example and will the prime minister finally release detail of his conversation surround teesworks as he be ask to do twice last year 
 i think the hon lady be talk about the report on teesworks as far as i can see what that report note be that the pace and scope of the regeneration have have a wide reach positive impact on the local economy and of course it be an independent external report it make it clear that there be no evidence of corruption or illegality and the government will of course respond to the recommendation in the report as soon as possible 
 i give my heartfelt thank to the prime minster for his support for our melton harborough and stamford village follow the recent devastating flooding ten of home farm and business in rutland be also devastate but our county be in effect exclude from ever receive support in the future due to the arbitrary floor currently in place flood support should be base on the most affected or a percentage of population but rutland must have time more flooding than next door lincolnshire for we ever to access support will my right hon friend please give a meeting to i and my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland   to discuss this important issue

 actually we be invest record sum in improve hospital infrastructure across the country in eastbourne in particular spade be already in the ground to deliver an elective surgical hub i know that there be local liberal democrat scaremongere about the future of service but the local conservative mp be do a fantastic job engage with her community and work with local health official 
 it be my huge pleasure to host the aerospace defence and security industry apprenticeship event in parliament yesterday welcome apprentice from collins aerospace in wolverhampton will the prime minister join i in national apprenticeship week in celebrate the opportunity that apprenticeship can provide in the defence industry as well as in our armed force which be all in the top apprenticeship provider 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the importance of our apprenticeship provision which be provide young people with opportunity across the country particularly in the defence and aerospace sector as she say those plan be in stark contrast to those of the labour party which have cave in to big business and be now propose to halve the amount of apprenticeship funding and the number of apprenticeship 
 if grangemouth refinery close scotland will be the only major oil produce nation without a refinery capacity at a time of energy insecurity be it not economic madness to allow a profitable plant to close and be it not environmental madness to tranship oil for refining and distribution across the increasingly dangerous high sea give the billion that the prime minister have receive and will continue to receive from north sea oil will he ensure that scotland retain a refinery capacity for scotland ’s oil 
 the future of grangemouth refinery be obviously a commercial decision for its owner but i be tell that the site will remain operate as a refinery until at least may in the meantime the uk and scottish governments be work together to seek assurance from grangemouth about how it be support employee we remain confident in our fuel supply on energy security which the hon gentleman mention this government be unambiguously back the north sea oil and gas sector because that be how we support energy security in this country attract investment and create job particularly in scotland 
 i be very proud that it be a conservative government who appoint the patient safety commissioner and that we commission the hughes report on medical device and medicine which be publish this morning will my right hon friend also make i proud by address the point that the commissioner have raise and bring forward a redress scheme in a timely manner 
 i be grateful to the patient safety commissioner and her team for their work on this important issue that i know my right hon friend have speak about in the past of course and foremost our sympathy remain with those affect by sodium valproate we be focus on improve the system and how it listen to patient and it be right that the government carefully consider the report ’s recommendation the department of health and social care will respond to the report in due course and the health secretary will keep the house update on a regular basis 
 many of my constituent such as local mum jessica have contact i about special educational need and disability support jessica ’s son have wait year for an autism diagnosis and he be not expect to have an education health and care plan in place by the time he go to secondary school will the prime minister confirm that student who need an ehcp will get so that they can thrive in school 
 of course we want to see every child thrive at school which be why we have triple the amount go into special educational need for capital place and put more money into support echp i be   sorry to hear about the case that the hon lady mention i will ensure that we continue to look at this matter in particular because as she say we want every child to thrive at school 
 i put on the record my good wish to his majesty the king and to her royal highness the princess of wales 
 building on the question ask by my right hon friend   the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes i know that my right hon friend the prime minister be exceptionally pleased about the hughes report which have be publish today a huge amount of work have be do by member from across the chamber include the hon member for livingston hannah bardell and for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson and my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north 
 may i press my right hon friend the prime minister on the fact that ten of thousand of woman and child have suffer immensely since the 1970 with government after government do nothing about it i be proud that this government have do something about it but i urge he in the strong term to talk to the chancellor to ensure that we can address the issue raise in the hughes report at the budget 
 i thank my right hon friend and colleague from all part of the house for their campaigning over many year on this issue as i say it be right not only that we extend our sympathy to those affect but that we carefully consider the recommendation from the patient safety commissioner ’s report i can assure my right hon friend that we will do that with all due haste and i know that the health secretary will keep the house update 
 why do the prime minister downgrade the role of minister for disabled people what message do he think that send to disabled people and will he commit to reconsider that move and ensure that the role be hold by a minister of state if not will he agree to meet with i and disabled people ’s organisation to explain his reasoning 
 actually the minister for disabled people my hon friend   the member for mid sussex mims davies be go to do a fantastic job because she care passionately about this issue this government have a record to be proud of whether that be support many more of those with disability into work and ensure they can live independently or make sure that child with complex disability have access to more change place across the country those be the value of this conservative government 
 i would also like to say to brianna ghey ’s mum who be here that as i say early this week what happen be an unspeakable and shocking tragedy in the face of that for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she do last weekend demonstrate the very good of humanity in the face of see the very bad of humanity she deserve all our admiration and praise for that 
 with your permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on our plan to recover and reform nhs dentistry though on behalf of the entire house and my department i send our very good wish to his majesty the king his decision to share his diagnosis will be welcome by anyone whose life have be touch by cancer and i know that we be all very much look forward to see he make a speedy recovery and resume his public duty 
 thank to a once in a generation pandemic patient across england do not come forward for appointment with nhs dentist between and since then we have take decisive action to recover service we have make reform to the dental contract so that practice be pay more fairly for care for nhs patient with more complex need and we have make sure that dentist update the nhs website regularly so that the public know that they be take on new patient that have deliver result with more than more people see an nhs dentist last year than in the year before however we know that too many particularly those live in rural or coastal community be still struggle to find appointment this recovery plan will put that right by make nhs dental care fast simple and fairer for patient and staff it be build on key pillar which i will address in turn 
 we will help anyone who need to see an nhs dentist to do so wherever they live and whatever their background to do this we must incentivise dentist across the country to care for more nhs patient that be why i be delighted to tell the house that for the come year we be offer dentist new payment on top of their usual payment for care—£15 for every check up they perform on nhs patient who have not be see over the past year and £ for every new nhs patient they treat who have not be see over the same period because we know that patient who do not have a relationship with a dentist find it hard to get care that be not a long term ambition our new patient premium will be available from next month 
 we be also increase the minimum payment that dentist receive for deliver nhs treatment which will support practice with the low unit of dental activity rate to provide more nhs care however we know that in many of our rural remote and isolated community dentist themselves be in short supply that be why start this year up to dentist will receive golden hello payment worth up to £ when they commit themselves to work in of those area for at least year these dentist will give patient the care they need fast make dental provision fair and tackle health inequality 
 we be also deliver dentistry to our most remote region without delay this year we will deploy dental van to more isolated rural and coastal area staff by nhs dentist they will offer check up and simple treatment such as filling this model have be a try and test success across many region for example last year in cornwall a mobile van visit harbour treat more than fisherman and their family we will be roll out up to van across devon   gloucestershire somerset norfolk suffolk lincolnshire cambridgeshire dorset cornwall north yorkshire and northamptonshire this move have be welcome by healthwatch the nuffield trust and the college of general dentistry we will let patient know when van will be in their area so they can get the care they need fast 
 these reform will empower nhs dentist to treat more than people and deliver more appointment as the chief executive of national voices a group of major health and care charity say 
 this extra money should help thousand of people who have be unable to see a dentist in the last year to get the care they need 
 these reform be just the beginning this recovery plan will also drive forward reform to make nhs dentistry sustainable for our child and our grandchild 
 that bring i to the pillar grow and upskille our workforce for the long term our long term workforce plan the in nhs history give we strong foundation on which to build by training place for dentist will increase by 40%—forty per cent and place for dental hygienist and therapist who can perform simple task such as filling will also rise by more dentist and more dental therapist will mean more care for nhs patient 
 i be delighted to tell the house today that we be go far in key way we will consult on a tie in to nhs work for dentistry graduate because right now too many be choose to deliver private work over valuable nhs care more than dentist in england be register with the general dental council but last year almost a work exclusively in the private sector train these dentist be a significant investment for taxpayer and they rightly expect it to result in the strong possible nhs care that be why this spring we will launch a consultation on a tie in for graduate dentist and how this could deliver more nhs care and well value for taxpayer 
 secondly we will take full advantage of our dental professional skill today even though they have the right training without write direction from a dentist dental therapist can not do thing such as administer antibiotic this year we will change this make life simple for dentist and make care fast for patient as the president of the college of general dentistry have say the 
 use of the full range of skill of all team member will enable the delivery of more care and make nhs dentistry more attractive to dental professional 
 thirdly we will recruit more international dentist to the nhs we have a plan to do this by work with the general dental council to get more international dentist take exam and to get they on to the register soon and to explore the creation of a new provisional registration status so that under the supervision of a dentist who be already on the register highly skilled international dentist can start treat patient soon rather than work as hygienist while they be wait to join the register 
 i turn now to our plan ’s pillar which be prioritise prevention and give child a healthy smile for life this begin by support parent to give their child the good possible start that be why family hub up and down the country will offer parent to be expert advice on look after their baby ’s tooth and gum as those   baby grow up we will support parent and nursery in make sure that before every child start primary school brush their tooth be part of their routine 
 the evidence be clear the early good habit be build the long they will last see a dentist regularly be vital for child ’s health but since the pandemic too many have be unable to do that that be why this year we be take care directly to child we will deploy mobile dental team to school in area with a shortage of nhs dentist they will apply a preventive fluoride varnish to more than reception age child ’s tooth strengthen they early and prevent decay our smile for life programme have already be endorse by the college of general dentistry 
 people in england already benefit from water fluoridation in order to go far in protect child ’s tooth we will consult on strengthen more of our country ’s water with fluoride again the evidence be clear in some of the most deprived part of england enhance fluoride level could reduce by up to the number of tooth that be extract because of decay that be why through the health and care act we have make it simple to add fluoride to more of our water supply as a step this year we will launch a consultation on expand water fluoridation across the north east an expansion that would give more people access to water that strengthen their tooth prevent tooth decay and tackle inequality 
 this be our government ’s plan to recover and reform dental care dental training place up by more appointment dental van treat more patient more dentist in remote area more dentist take on nhs patient well support for family and well care for child patient access up and inequity come down it will make life simple for staff and treatment fast and fairer for patient and staff we have take the difficult decision and we have now deliver a long term plan to make dental care fast simple and fairer for people across the country we be go to get on with the job and put our plan into action and i commend this statement to the house 
 i wholeheartedly associate myself and my party with the secretary of state ’s remark on send our good wish to his majesty the king have go through a cancer diagnosis myself i particularly send good wish to his family for whom a diagnosis be often more difficult than for the person receive it 
 also in the generous spirit in which we have begin may i thank the health and social care secretary for accidentally e mail i her entire plan yesterday that go above and beyond the courtesy that we normally expect i look forward to receive her party ’s election manifesto any day now but of course we will have to write our to give her party some inspiration 
 after year of conservative government nhs dentistry be in decay in dentist be not take on new patient and in the south west of england the figure be in people have be force to   attempt diy dentistry dickensian conditions!—because they can not see an nhs dentist and they can not afford to go private interruption 
 order mr baker i be sorry but i do not want any more heckling from you you do a little bit early i want everybody to listen to the secretary of state and i expect they to do the same for the shadow secretary of state 
 do not worry mr speaker i will come back to the parliamentary private secretary shortly tooth decay be the no.1 reason for child age to be admit to hospital unbelievably there have be report of ukrainian refugee book dentist appointment back home and return for treatment because it be easy to fly to a war tear country than it be to see an nhs dentist in england well at least government policy be get flight off the ground and it be certainly not the government ’s rwanda scheme failure 
 let we look at the human consequence of this conservative tragedy labour ’s candidate in great yarmouth keir cozens tell i about jeanette a young woman in her 30 who have struggle with gum and mouth problem all her life she use to be able to get treatment now she can not find an nhs dentist in all of norfolk to take she she can not afford to go private it hurt to smile it hurt to laugh and the pain be so great that jeanette do not go out anymore just this week she resort to try to remove her tooth herself that be not right for anyone of any age but jeanette should be in the prime of her life will the secretary of state apologise to jeanette and the million like she for what the conservatives have do to nhs dentistry 
 after year of neglect cut and incompetence the government have today announce a policy of more appointment recruiting dentist to the area most in need and toothbrushing for child it sound awfully familiar they be adopt much of labour ’s rescue plan for dentistry do that not show that the conservatives be out of idea of their own and be look to labour to fix the mess they have make i say next time conservative ministers say that labour do not have a plan or that labour ’s plan be not credible do not believe a word of it 
 there be some difference between our party approach labour be pledge an extra urgent and emergency appointment which be additional to the appointment announce today can the health secretary confirm that the government ’s plan do not provide any additional emergency support labour propose supervise early year toothbrushing and conservative mp accuse it of be nanny state do the health secretary stand by that label or do she now support child under be support in brush their tooth 
 the key difference be that we recognise that our plan be a rescue plan and that to put nhs dentistry back on its foot immediate reform of the dental contract be need without that the government ’s plan be doom to fail do not just take my word for it the british dental association have say that the plan will not stop the exodus of dentist from the nhs will not provide a dentist for every patient who need and will not put an end to this crisis 
 i come to the parliamentary private secretary   the hon member for north norfolk duncan baker and the miserable script that the whip be spread out on the table if labour ’s contract be to blame why have the government not reform it in year and why be they not reform it now in the conservatives promise in their election manifesto to reform the dental contract they be bring back not just lord cameron but his broken promise people have be desperately try to get dental care for year but there be nothing from the conservative party now that we be in an election year the conservatives be try to kick the can down the road and be scramble for a plan they only discover their heart when they fear in their heart for their political future and the consequence have be see queue around the block in bristol 
 finally the secretary of state be promise reform after and after the next general election who be she try to kid after the conservatives will be go and if they be not nhs dentistry will be how many more chance do they expect how many more break promise will there be we have and their time be up and it be time for labour to deliver the change that this country need 
 i try to help the hon gentleman by give he an advance copy of my speech yesterday yet that be his speech this government be focus on deliver for patient perhaps i can help he understand the difference between the opposition ’s proposal and the government ’s fully fund dental recovery plan the opposition ’s ambition reach only as far as more appointment our plan will provide more than time that number of appointment across the country that be to help he with his math we be offer golden hello to dentist who will work in hard to reach and under serve area their proposal cover only they have no plan for training more dentist we set out in the long term workforce plan last year and again in the dental recovery plan that we will increase training place for dentist by by 
 then we have the centrepiece of the opposition ’s proposal make teacher swap their textbook for toothbrush an idea that be hat by teacher and that patronise parent we believe that most parent do a great job of look after their child i know that the labour party do not agree with that the hon gentleman call our child short and fat on a medium round we believe that most parent do a great job and that be why we support pregnant mums to be and support parent in family hub and nursery we will not wait until reception class by which time child have already get their tooth 
 i want to dwell on the experience of anybody live under labour in labour run wales health service in wales be devolve and the leader of the opposition have call wales the blueprint for how the opposition will run our health system welsh labour have the high proportion of nhs dental practice not accept new adult patient and the joint high proportion of those not accept new child patient in wales of nhs dental practice be not accept new adult patient that be a high figure than for any other nation in the uk some of practice there be not accept new child patient which be the joint high figure with northern ireland our plan be fully fund but how will   labour pay for its plan by use the magical money tree the list of policy fund by the non dom policy be as long as my arm in it promise to fund a workforce plan last september it become breakfast club meal by october it morph into appointment and scan equipment by christmas it be fund a dentistry plan it be the same old labour it have no plan 
 i call the father of the house 
 the house enjoy the word of the opposition spokesman   the hon member for ilford north wes streeting although i be not sure how many he write himself some may have seem rather familiar to anyone who read matthew parris this morning on go to ukraine to have a filling fix 
 in west sussex in worthing and arun we want the same situation find in part of london where dentist have a sign say new nhs patient welcome have the secretary of state be work with the british dental association and the general dental council to bring forward registration to get incentive right and to make sure that dentist be no long tell you can not serve any more patient because you will go above your limit can she confirm that we be take limit off so that dentist especially the young one can do as much work as they can and can help as many patient as possible so that we can get back to the situation that we be in before labour change the rule about year ago 
 we have focus this plan on introduce the new patient premium a bonus for new patient have discuss this carefully with professional we think that be way that we can incentivise people into nhs practice dentist can already work up to of the contract many do that but some sadly do not so we be try to encourage those dentist who already have nhs contract to go the extra mile and use the full slot available to they 
 the health and social care committee take month gather evidence and put together a recovery plan which the government should have adopt dentist want that plan put in place central to it be reform of the nhs dental contract however the secretary of state have completely fail to even mention reform of that contract as a result dentistry in my constituency in york where constituent be wait year to see a dentist will not have the recovery that she talk about why do she not adopt our plan 
 i hope the hon lady will as usual be the help that i expect she to be to her constituent in publicise this plan we be get graphic and information out to all member of parliament so that they can help their constituent understand what will be available in their area because each and every of we want the very good for our constituent she will be interested in the new patient premium which be encourage dentist back into nhs practice or into nhs practice for the time and in the increase price for unit of dental activity reform of the dental contract be part of our agenda but we realise that we need to give immediate help to community such as her 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i welcome the plan recovery and reform be right and the select committee will study the plan carefully the dental minister my right hon friend   the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom have already be invite to come before we so that we can talk it through with she to see whether it reflect our aforementioned report on the subject the golden hello the toothbrushing for pre schooler as long as the workforce can handle it and the mobile van be good but even a day long of a contract focus on unit of dental activity be a problem can the secretary of state say how she plan to entice professional into return to nhs dentistry so many have leave and that be key 
 very much so and that will be primarily through the patient premium which will mean that from next month dentist will be able to turn their sign from closed to open for nhs patient we want to use lever that could be deploy immediately in order to help our constituent 
 it be estimate that more than people be wait for dental treatment but the government ’s announcement say that it will help just the government ’s underspend last year be £ and it be expect to be the same this year but only £ have be announce this plan be a drop in the ocean in st albans my dentist be desperate to provide nhs care and my constituent be desperate to see a dentist at the heart of the problem be the broken contract will the government take up the liberal democrats plan to reform the contract and provide guarantee access to an nhs dentist for everybody need urgent and emergency care 
 i heartily recommend the recovery plan to the hon lady because it offer more appointment and have a long term ambition for the prevention of tooth decay in child in addition it have that long turn vision about increase training place for our dental professional by by 
 as you be aware mr speaker i have a declare interest in this particular topic 
 as my right hon friend the secretary of state be aware dentistry in england be a seller ’s market it be estimate that there be dentist vacancy in england when i come here in the early 70 with my dental degree like very many colleague from australia new zealand and so on i present at the general dental council who say welcome and stamp my hand and i go off and work on the national health service the next day 
 now and for decade the general dental council have require graduate from world class dental school every bit as good as the one we have here to wait to pay and to sit what be call an overseas registration exam currently the waiting list for the exam be overseas dental graduate many of whom be every bit as good as those we produce in this country the gdc could change that overnight by accept graduate automatically from know and trust international school will my right hon friend please have a small chat with the chairman of the general dental council 
 i thank my hon friend and recognise the enormous expertise he bring to the chamber on this matter he know he have genuinely talk to i about this on many occasion the important role that the general dental council play to ensure that we get international dentist register as quickly as possible i very much look forward to discuss that with the gdc so that we can get more international dentist on to our register and work in our practice 
 i welcome much in the plan which mirror many of my idea over the year and indeed much in labour ’s plan however on access the government claim that the recovery plan will deliver care for up to people but government datum show that people in england have unmet dentistry need which leave about people without an nhs dentist that include my constituent beverley kitson who have osteoporosis and take alendronic acid as treatment the drug have damage her tooth and she now require a check up every month after of her tooth have decay to such an extent that they need to be extract beverley have be with the same dental practice for year but she have just be tell that it be go fully private leave she without an nhs dentist will the secretary of state guarantee beverley that she will be able to access an nhs dentist under these plan 
 we have very much try to ensure that dentist who already hold nhs contract will keep they and keep work they that be why we have fall upon the new patient premium to make it more in their financial interest to take on new patient i appreciate the hon lady ’s point about retention which again we be look to address through the increase in the uda but we all acknowledge that dentist be independent contractor so we must ask they and particularly those who be new dental graduate to do their bit and help our nhs out 
 a number of nhs dentist across erewash have recently retire leave a cohort of my constituent without access to nhs dentistry unfortunately practice be find it really difficult to recruit replacement for the retiree how will the plan help speed up that recruitment so that my constituent be not without nhs dentistry for much long 
 may i thank my hon friend for all the work she do in the department and have do on this subject we be take a long term view with training dentist as i say last year through the long term workforce plan we set out an ambition to train up to more dentist by as we also begin the consultation on a tie in with those graduate we be confident that we will see a great supply of dentist to our nhs service 
 the £ pledge today be less than half last year ’s record break underspend the plan say that any underspend will be ringfence for dentistry that be promise by a minister last year but it do not happen because integrate care board be use that underspend why should the of dentist in the west midland who can not and be not accept any new patient believe it will be any different this year 
 the hon lady alight on an important fact that be sometimes lose in this debate although an nhs dentist may have an nhs contract they may not work the whole of that contract some nhs dentist very much do so other work a fraction of it we be try to encourage dentist who do not use their full contract to do so because that in itself will bring in more patient we be confident that alongside the new patient premium that will help constituent such as her to get the treatment they need 
 wokingham have a fast grow population base on build a lot of new home so as the secretary of state roll out her new plan will she also ensure that there be incentive to provide dental service on the nhs in area where a population be move in and need they 
 my right hon friend raise an interesting point indeed that be exactly the sort of discussion i be have with my right hon friend the levelling up secretary because i be really interested in have that connected and join up approach between planning and health i think it could bring dividend for we all 
 i do not believe that what the secretary of state have describe will deal with the complexity of dental problem out there i have a constituent who be refer to the manchester dental hospital for a possible abscess and be tell that even an urgent referral would take a month in fact the dental hospital do not get back to she for month after the referral it offer she a telephone consultation the amount of pain and infection mean that she have to seek private treatment at a cost of £ but many can not afford that include the young man wheel into royal bolton hospital in great pain leak blood on the floor after try to remove a painful tooth with plier what do the health secretary say to patient who have long stand and complex dental problem and be pay the price by wait in pain pay for private treatment or try to remove their own tooth 
 i take that constituency case very seriously i be really keen to urge the hon lady that if a constituent contact she in future with that level of discomfort and pain she should advise that constituent to contact and if necessary go to accident and emergency—[interruption labour member be shake their head but what she have just describe be a serious situation that constituent need medical attention and the nhs be there ready and willing to help that be the advice that she should be give her constituent and i hope that she take it as seriously as i do interruption 
 order the secretary of state be give an answer to a question we do not need all this shouting people might not agree with the answer but you have to listen to the answer 
 in congratulate my right hon friend my personal friend on this welcome excellent statement may i ask she to forgive the ferocity with which my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward   leigh   and i make the case for nhs dentistry when we meet she recently in that spirit will she ensure that some of these new dentist come to rural lincolnshire where we desperately need good dental care she have today irrigate the dental desert 
 i give my very sincere thank to my right hon friend the house can imagine the advocacy i have receive from both he and my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh on reach rural and coastal area as a proud lincolnshire mp myself i want to bring about a set of plan that will address those underserved area i be delighted that the plan meet with my right hon friend ’s approval 
 the secretary of state will be aware that the nhs dentistry crisis have be year in the making she will also be aware that it be impossible for anybody in knowsley today to sign up with an nhs dentist the measure the secretary of state have describe may over time help to meet the problem but what advice would she give today to my constituent who can not get an nhs dentist 
 the advice and guidance to dentist will be go out today while the new patient premium that i have tell the house about will come in from march it be week away 
 i thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for an excellent statement and an excellent plan it be exactly what patient in suffolk have be wait to hear the rural payment the bonus there and the mobile service i be conscious that many dentist have choose not to have more patient and they might blame the contract this that or the other that be why i welcome her plan about potentially tie in graduate to the nhs my hon friend   the member for mole valley sir paul beresford   have already refer to the general dental council which in my view have not take full advantage of the regulation that come into force last march will the secretary of state also look at the nhs ’s own rule that far restrict the rapid supply of dentist into the nhs for our constituent 
 i thank my right hon friend for all the work she do on dentistry in the department i be conscious that many people have contribute to this plan i be grateful to she and other again i hear the observation on the general dental council and will ensure that the gdc hear they as well that be a fair challenge to the nhs colleague will see that the plan be co sign by nhs england which share our ambition to deliver those more appointment and set up the future of nhs dentistry for our country 
 today ’s statement by the health secretary will have be listen to with great interest by my constituent in edinburgh west who share a lot of the same concern face the same difficulty get nhs dental treatment and will be look for the same sort of solution as constituent in england could the secretary of state clarify for i and for all those who come to i whether there will be barnett consequential if there be will she impress upon the scottish government the need to ringfence   the money and actually invest it in dental service if not would she be willing to share with the scottish government how she be approach the problem in the hope that they might actually respond and do something 
 i hear the frustration in the hon lady ’s question this be a devolved area as it be in wales and be therefore a matter for the scottish national party i assume the hon lady will continue her usual advocacy on behalf of her constituent to ensure that the snp look at what be happen in england and try to do well for scotland 
 i really welcome this plan i welcome the extra £ the new patient bonus the measure to get dentist into area that do not have they and the minimum uda these be all good thing that will help people in harborough oadby and wigston to get a dentist can i ask the secretary of state to press on with thing the be the move to a proper national funding formula dentistry be the only part of the nhs without a funding formula which disadvantage shire and coastal area with old population the be the next round of contract reform the move to band 2b be work and dentist be use it but there be patient with complex case for whom a capitation like payment would be much well as the british dental association point out i encourage the secretary of state to start work on that difficult group so that we can get extra help for they too 
 i must thank my hon friend for all his work i know how much how much effort and commitment he have put into these plan and it show the genuine—[interruption sorry   the hon member for ilford north wes streeting   be be a little ungracious my hon friend   the member for harborough neil o’brien   have be part of the united work across government to deliver these plan i very much take on board his recommendation and encouragement as i say we see this plan as deliver more appointment for our constituent but of course we want to look to the long term as well 
 be the secretary of state aware that rip van winkle fall asleep for year this conservative government have be asleep for even long than that as far as dentistry be concern will the secretary of state now wake up and talk to real working dentist such as phil lucitt of my excellent nhs dentist in huddersfield who be in the gallery with his wife today and get something do about this crisis it be a crisis in huddersfield as in every town in this country such as bristol as we hear yesterday people be in pain people be suffer and for year her government have do little about it 
 i must admit that i do not know quite where that question be go but i think the hon gentleman be urge i to speak to dentist i be delighted to reassure he that my ministerial official and i do of course speak to dentist in fact only today i be at a practice in the heart of westminster speak   to a dental manager who welcome this plan i will veer away and resist the temptation to comment on rip van winkle 
 i welcome this dental recovery plan which will help to deliver dentistry in darlington can my right hon friend the secretary of state provide i with advice on what more i can do to get my integrate care board to get on with the commissioning at firthmoor community centre which lose its dentistry practice month ago in look to expand the number of dental training place i urge the secretary of state to look at teesside university which have ambition to build on its exist dental technology provision and train the tees valley dentist of tomorrow 
 thank to the work of my hon friend and other tees valley be a powerhouse of growth industry as exemplify by the chancellor in his budget and autumn statement recently i will take away my hon friend ’s word of advice about his university on the point about encourage icb to take part in this work as this plan be a joint document with nhs england the expectation will be on icb to deliver the plan because they exist to look after our constituent this plan be of the way we will be able to secure that help 
 in bedford and kempston like many area in the country we have a dental crisis i have raise the matter of dentistry previously include in a westminster hall debate there can be no question but that under this conservative government there be a dentistry crisis and the people of this country have be fail why do the health secretary refuse to admit that year of neglect and underspending have lead we to this 
 say the script i assume the hon gentleman will welcome the more appointment that this dental recovery plan will deliver for all our country 
 i thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for this brilliant statement and thank all the team for their huge amount of hard work today be dentist day yesterday be dentist day for i as i have an appointment with the minister and an appointment with a real dentist from south derbyshire this news be absolutely superb will the secretary of state get dentist to move to south derbyshire and ensure more free nhs dentistry there 
 i have no doubt that with my hon friend ’s characteristic joy and as an irresistible force of nature she herself will be an advert for dentist to come to work in her constituency 
 a constituent recently tell i that when she try to register member of her family with an nhs dentist she be tell that there be an year wait we know that workforce be a really big issue on that basis will the secretary of state meet i and a cross party group of members of parliament to talk about how we   could develop a dental school at the site of the excellent hull york medical school to grow our own dentist for the future 
 the right hon lady will know that part of the focus of the long term workforce plan be to train people where they be most need i will happily arrange for she to meet the relevant minister on registration the current system be not like a gp practice where once a family be register they can only go to that gp the whole reason that we have be encourage dentist to update their detail on the nhs website be so that people can move around to visit different dentist to get the treatment they need today ’s plan will help turbocharge those effort
