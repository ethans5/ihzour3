my hon friend obviously know a great deal about this as a result of his distinguished year of experience in the house but pivotal role allowance have be in place for year to help we to retain certain key individual a number of initiative be introduce by my distinguished predecessor lord maude the former right hon member for horsham and i intend to build on those but i be happy to engage with my hon friend because this be a serious issue 
 in the last year for which we have figure there be a turnover from the senior civil service and resignation be at we need to look carefully at what that mean across different role and at how we can retain the specialism for long period so that key government programme benefit from the sort of leadership that have endure expertise at the table 
 i be look carefully at where we be with the plan for this year obviously there be a half way point in that cycle and at what policy we can put in place at the beginning of october the chancellor announce a freeze on recruitment i will be look at what we need to do now to ensure that as we move into future financial year we use the benefit of efficiency that exist and different way of deliver service which we can learn from across the globe and the private sector so that we get value for money for all those who be employ and do a good job in the civil service 
 i very much encourage my hon friend to take this matter up with the department for energy security and net but for my part i understand that anyone bid for contract for difference our main renewable support scheme must submit supply chain plan include how many applicant will support sme the department be also consult on reform that will give great revenue support to applicant use more sustainable supply chain include those that make great use of sme 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of his department during the covid-19 pandemic 
 the cabinet office play a crucial role in co ordinate the cross government response to the pandemic and we continue to learn lesson from it last year the cabinet office publish the resilience framework an ambitious wide reach and long term plan that be already work to strengthen our national resilience 
 those of we who lose love one during the pandemic have be leave shocked and anger by the revelation be unearth in the covid inquiry they include quote from the diary of the then government chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance that the current prime minister think 
 just let people die and that ’ ok 
 if that be not cruel enough he be also overhear say that ministers should focus on 
 handle the scientist and not the virus 
 do the secretary of state agree with i that this show a shameful disregard for people ’s life and callous decision making at the heart of government 
 i should say from the outset that i simply do not recognise that characterisation but that be the whole point of the inquiry this government set up the inquiry for the sake of the victim and the nation to get to the bottom of what be an unprecedented crisis not just here but around the world we have be totally open and transparent with that inquiry we have give it over piece of evidence i would gently urge the hon gentleman to allow the inquiry to complete its investigation to hear from all the witness and to produce its recommendation as i have commit to that inquiry the government will respond fully to every single recommendation from lady justice hallett 
 during the pandemic i could only see the true professionalism of civil servant in a variety of department include the cabinet office and i be very conscious of some of the pain be feel about the victim of that time do my right hon friend agree with i that the civil service really stand up to the challenge of deal with imperfect datum and a rapidly change situation by the way i include the civil servant of the department for work and pensions in that regard however may i also encourage he to consider how we can strengthen analytical skill and capability right across the civil service that be important and i think it will be of the key lesson that should come out of the inquiry 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question and i pay tribute to she for her many year of service in the cabinet i agree with her characterisation of the civil service indeed in my time work in various ministerial role i have see true professionalism and dedication however i think she be absolutely right that we need to improve both our data analytic and the data flow into government of the thing we learn during the covid pandemic be for example that set up the data centre in the cabinet office massively improve the amount of datum we receive that enable we to deal with these very fast move situation and indeed we have use it in subsequent crisis 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the deputy prime minister have just say that he do not recognise the alleged remark of the prime minister who be suppose to have say 
 just let people die and that ’ ok 
 as set out by my hon friend   the member for slough mr dhesi i be sure that the deputy prime minister would agree that the way to deal with this be through transparency with the ongoing inquiry i write to he last month to ask he about the prime minister handing over all his whatsapp message particularly give that the prime minister ’s account that he no long have access to all of they seem implausible with the prime minister appear before the covid inquiry before the end of the year can the deputy prime minister confirm that all the prime minister ’s whatsapp message for this period will be make available to the inquiry 
 i can assure the right hon gentleman that we will furnish the inquiry with every single piece of information it require indeed i would note that the prime minister and all those who be request to provide information to the inquiry be legally oblige to do so that be precisely what we have do my department alone have provide over different piece of evidence i would gently say to he that the labour party repeatedly call for this inquiry to be set up we have set up this inquiry and i think hon member should allow it to do its job not jump to conclusion when it produce its recommendation i can assure the house that the government will respond in full 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure value for money in public procurement 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure value for money in public procurement 
 value for money be central to the government ’s long stand procurement policy as set out in everybody ’s favourite treasury document manage public money current procurement regulation require contracting authority to select the most economically advantageous tender the procurement act i be pleased to say that it have recently receive royal assent will streamline procurement process and ensure that value for money remain of the central tenet of the uk ’s procurement regime 
 if the minister think that every pound of taxpayer money matter what be the government ’s plan to recover the loss of billion of pound in flawed covid contract 
 i be pleased to be able to remind the house that the government have already take extraordinary step to recover fraud money during the covid period his majesty ’s revenue and customs remain committed to the recovery of covid-19 support scheme fraud the government be also commit to bear down on fraud in the covid loan scheme some £ have be allocate to the national investigation service over year to double its investigative capacity on bounce back loan and to fund other activity this be just a small sample of the work be do to combat fraud across our government 
 far to the comment of my hon friend   the member for blaydon liz twist billion of pound of public money be waste during the covid pandemic through dodgy contract that we know be sign off by the government labour have say that we will appoint a covid corruption commissioner to pursue every pound of public money that have be inappropriately lose from pandemic relate contract fraud and waste will the minister borrow our plan 
 i be sure the hon gentleman will have note i imagine he pay attention to such thing that we already set out in the spring statement last year the public sector fraud authority which be base in the cabinet office and very ably handle by my colleague baroness neville rolfe we have debate fraud during covid many time in the house all the contract hand out during covid be sign off by extremely able and capable civil servant who be work in very difficult circumstance and the idea that there be ministerial sign off of these thing be wrong and must be contradict whenever it be raise 
 it be clear from the chancellor ’s autumn statement yesterday that we will need to make saving in public sector budget for some year to come to overcome the impact of inflation so can the minister say how artificial intelligence will play a role in that in the public sector and what effort he be make to procure the necessary system 
 my right hon friend make an excellent point we be still come to term with the potential of artificial intelligence to speed up government process   improve productivity and deliver value for money for the taxpayer while we have procurement framework at present that help departments across government identify good ai system they might wish to secure we be also interested in develop our own ai within government my right hon friend the deputy prime minister announce early this week that we would hire more people with the high level of innovative skill to come into government to build those system for we and deliver value for money 
 what progress he have make on implement the final recommendation on compensation in the interim report of the infected blood inquiry publish on april 
 what progress his department have make on implement the interim recommendation of the infected blood inquiry 
 i strongly commend   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   for her work for those who have be impact by the infected blood scandal and i look forward to work across the house on this important issue the government have accept the moral case for compensation but it be only reasonable that the response be fully inform by sir brian langstaff ’s final report which be anticipate in march next year 
 month ago recommendation of the final report on compensation call for interim payment of £ to be 
 pay to recognise the death of people to date unrecognised and alleviate immediate suffering 
 the cambridge dictionary describe the word interim as something 
 temporary and intend to be use or accept until something permanent exist 
 i know the minister be a good man and will want to do his good so can he tell the house when those interim payment will start to be pay 
 may i welcome the minister to his new front bench role 
 i can not tell the right hon lady that today but in the day that i have be in this post i have recognise this to be my high priority in the role there be a number of complex issue that i need to come to term with but i be familiar with the whole issue from my previous role as chief secretary to the treasury this might be a matter of gamekeeper turn poacher but i understand the mindset of the treasury and how we can get a solution that deal with the range of recommendation i can not say anything more of substance today but i will be have further meeting across whitehall with more this morning and i be determined that this government will respond as comprehensively as we can as soon as we can 
 i have raise in write and oral question with the former paymaster general   the right hon member for horsham jeremy quin the case of a constituent of mine whose father die follow infected factor viii treatment the family could not even grieve properly because of the stigma around hiv and aids at the time compensation will not bring their father back but it would give the family closure my constituent contact i after a statement in which the former paymaster general say that the government accept that there be a moral case for compensation for those affect by the scandal as the minister have just do but also say that those infected and affected have suffer enough give the acceptance by ministers that the child of those infect have suffer enough when will the government make interim compensation payment to the estate of those who have die as a result of infected blood product and separately to those affect whose parent have die 
 the good answer i can give the hon lady be that it will be 
 as quickly as reasonable thoroughness permit 
 as the inquiry chair say in his response i be totally aware and sincere in my appreciation of the frustration that exist on this issue as i say day in i be do everything i can to move thing forward and to gain assurance from across whitehall so that i can update the house as quickly as possible i sense the palpable frustration and i realise that this issue need action as soon as possible 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister to his new role he will know that time be of the essence with a victim of this scandal die every day he also know that there be nothing to stop the government set up a compensation scheme now the failure to do so be weigh heavily on the mind of those affect the cynical would think that the government be just kick the issue into the long grass can the minister tell we when he hop to report on preparation for compensation and appoint a chair for an appropriate body to run the scheme 
 what i can say to the hon lady be that i be familiar with the range of activity that need to take place i be get into the detail of every single of they but i have to gain collective agreement before i can announce anything to this house this house will be the place i make any announcement when i have secure that i acknowledge her frustration and i be do everything i can i will update the house as quickly as i can 
 what step his department be take to improve access to public sector procurement process for small and medium sized business 
 the procurement act will deliver simple more effective public sector procurement and help small and   medium sized enterprise secure a great share of approximately £ of expenditure per year the act place a requirement on contracting authority to assess the particular barrier face sme throughout the entire procurement life cycle and to consider what can be do to overcome they 
 the renewable energy sector offer great opportunity for sme to become involved in the supply chain many of they be unaware of the public sector tender that be out there what be the government do to ensure that sme be make more aware of the opportunity available 
 i very much encourage my hon friend to take this matter up with the department for energy security and net but for my part i understand that anyone bid for contract for difference our main renewable support scheme must submit supply chain plan include how many applicant will support smes.[official report   january vol c. 6mc the department be also consult on reform that will give great revenue support to applicant use more sustainable supply chain include those that make great use of sme 
 i thank the minister for his response and   the hon member for cleethorpes martin vickers   for raise this matter northern ireland and particularly my constituency of strangford have a great many small and medium sized business that depend greatly on opportunity for government contract what discussion have the minister have with the department of finance in northern ireland on a united approach similar to that refer to by the hon member for cleethorpes i would love to see that in northern ireland 
 my hon friend will be pleased to hear and will remember from discussion we have as the procurement act be make its way through parliament that northern ireland will benefit from the new post eu regime that we have bring in unlike our friend in scotland who choose to opt out england wales and northern ireland have be able to shrug off the overly bureaucratic regime that we inherit from the eu and create alongside small and medium sized business a brand new way of do thing i know that small and medium sized enterprise in his constituency will ultimately benefit from that 
 whether he have have discussion with the independent adviser on ministers interest on declaration of interest by the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs 
 whether he have have discussion with the independent adviser on ministers interest on declaration of interest by the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs 
 there be an establish regime in place for the declaration and management of private interest hold by ministers as be set out in the ministerial code preliminary discussion have be hold with the   foreign secretary in consultation with the independent adviser on ministers interest to ensure that all interest be manage appropriately

 i do not recognise the hon lady ’s characterisation of the foreign secretary ’s employment history what i would say be that there be a thorough process in place through the ministerial code whereby the independent adviser publish statement on ministers relevant interest yesterday i meet the independent adviser for the time to speak in general term about his role and work be under way on the next list to include the relevant interest of newly appoint ministers i think there be about of they the government ’s position on china remain unchanged we believe in engage directly and robustly in the uk national interest 
 when lord cameron the public face of greensill be in the room where it happen when key decision be make and attend board meeting regularly there be a perception that he be part of greensill ’s inner circle have the independent adviser assess whether lord cameron be consider a shadow director during his time at greensill 
 the foreign secretary have account for his conduct in relation to greensill capital and independent review by the registrar of consultant lobbyists and the advisory committee on business appointments confirm that no rule be break his ennoblement be also approve by the house of lords appointments commission i have refer to the process that be under way with the independent adviser for all new ministers and the update that will be forthcoming in due course from he that be all i can say on the matter

 i want to ask about an angle of the matter mention by my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh the foreign secretary receive fulsome praise from the china harbour engineering company for his role in promote the port city colombo project in sri lanka can the minister tell the house who the ultimate client be when the foreign secretary receive payment from kpmg sri lanka for his role in promote that project be it the sri lankan government or the china harbour engineering company which be own by the chinese state 
 that be a matter not for i but for the process that i have set out which have be comply with i believe that lord cameron have make some comment with respect to those matter 
 what the responsibility of the ministers without portfolio be 
 what the responsibility of the ministers without portfolio be 
 minister without portfolio contribute to the policy and decision make process of a government it be routine for the chair of the govern party to be make a minister without portfolio as such they serve as a member of the cabinet my role as a cabinet office minister be to provide scrutiny and oversight across all departments to ensure that we deliver good value for the public 
 i welcome the right hon lady back to the front bench if a prime minister need to install a minister for common sense be that an admission that they do not really have any 
 i have see the report in the paper describe i as the minister of common sense i appreciate that the concept be difficult for opposition members to grasp i be committed to deliver common sense decision such as delay the ban on petrol and diesel car delay the ban on oil and gas boiler scrap high speed from birmingham to manchester and reduce the overseas budget all common sense policy that those on the opposition benches have vote against those on the government benches be full of common sense i be build on all those policy 
 i welcome the minister to her post if her front bench be full of common sense which will she tackle a home secretary who think that stockton north be a proverbial toilet a foreign secretary who during a critical time in geopolitic be not even   accountable to this house or a transport secretary whose network north plan think that manchester be in preston 
 of all i do not hear my right hon friend the home secretary say the comment that the hon member repeat as far as i be aware he have deny say they as i say i be build on the success of this government let i give another the big permanent tax cut in modern british history announce yesterday cut taxis not like the opposition who want more borrowing and spending 
 i warmly congratulate my right hon friend on her new role will it include the possibility of re examine the vaccine damage payment scheme which have be describe at the public inquiry as not fit for purpose the £ maximum payment have not be increase since and the disability threshold be cause a massive injustice will she address those issue please 
 i thank my hon friend for bring this matter which he have work extremely hard on to the attention of the house i be grateful for that suggestion i will take it away and come back with further information 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate the new minister without portfolio on her position and i wish she well have see the prime minister ’s struggle use a contactless card at a petrol station and his impression that a private helicopter be the good way to get to southampton i think he probably be in need of some common sense so it be no surprise that the right hon lady have be refer to in that way give she be in the market for some common sense idea i suggest that the government adopt a policy that people who live here pay taxis on all their income and abolish the non dom tax status perhaps she could cast her mind to abolish the tax break for private school and spend that money on the who go to state school be it just the case that this government be totally out of common sense and idea 
 it do not surprise i that those on the labour benches attack private school which lot of parent want to send their child to for they that be common sense for they that be freedom of choice which i stand by of course should they close private school down the public sector would have to find billion more to fund it again not value for money something that i be here to deliver from labour 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of compliance with the ministerial code 
 the prime minister make it clear upon his appointment that he will lead a government of integrity professionalism and accountability at every level and he be deliver on that promise 
 the minister a few moment ago in answer to specific question say that this be not a matter for he of course the problem with the ministerial code be that the public do not have confidence that it be actually be deliver there be very little transparency around investigation and around referral to the independent adviser on ministers interest with particular reference to lord cameron ’s appointment will the minister commit to publish all the correspondence with the ministerial adviser on the code and any correspondence around the list he have to give to the permanent secretary on his interest prior to appointment 
 with the great respect i do not think the hon gentleman understand that the independent adviser on ministers interest have wide range power within week of appointment a minister will have to fill in a form which be recently change month ago and have over page cover a wide range of aspect of their interest there be then a process where the permanent secretary of the relevant department comment on that and the independent adviser will then publish an update of relevant interest this be a thorough process i meet the independent adviser yesterday i suggest to the hon gentleman that he write to the independent adviser to seek the correspondence he wish 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 when will the list of ministerial relevant interest next be publish and will the interest of all the new ministers be include in it 
 i be not certain but work be under way there be i think new ministers i think it will be a matter of week but i will keep an eye on that the independent adviser do not give i a date yesterday but i will continue to work closely with he where i can 
 we would appreciate it if that list could be publish before christmas at the late because it be incredibly important section of the ministerial code prohibit ministers from lobby government for a year period after they leave office it do not unfortunately say anything about interest before they be put into office do the minister understand that with trust in politician at an all time low the perception of lord cameron be put into the role have clearly be lobby on behalf of hostile foreign interest do nothing for the perception of politician as trustworthy 
 i just do not accept the hon lady ’s view i have set out in previous answer this morning that there be an establish thorough process that be constantly be update there be regular update by the independent adviser the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and secretary of state in the cabinet office my right hon friend   the member for hertsmere oliver dowden assure i that that update will be out before the end of this calendar year that work will continue and i expect and the independent adviser and the prime minister expect the high standard to apply where there be change to an individual ’s circumstance or interest there be an urgent imperative to update the independent adviser 
 what recent assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the border target operating model on cross border flow of good 
 the government be deliver an ongoing programme of engagement with stakeholder across all sector in all part of the country and with key european union trading partner to ensure good continue to move across the border we have not identify any specific risk to the cross border flow of good 
 it have be a very long wait to get border check in place on the uk side what evidence do the minister have that eu business have the appropriate system in place include enough vet to make they work smoothly what estimate have he make of the impact on uk food security 
 the whole purpose of the exercise be to ensure that we have uk food security the border target operating model will implement its next major milestone on   january   april   and   october which mean that the regime will be introduce by increment this will be good for british food and good for british animal 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the list of ministers interest in ensure that ministers a declare and b avoid any conflict of interest 
 there be an establish regime under which minister interest be declare and manage minister seek the advice of their permanent secretary and the independent adviser on ministers interest who report twice yearly this be but element of a network of ethic system include the ministerial code and the business appointment rule which uphold the high standard in government 
 the minister say that there be a network of ethic system for the appointment of ministers so let i ask a simple question when be the last time lord cameron be not domicile in the uk 
 that be a question for lord cameron but i would be amazed if he have not be domicile in this country for his entire life 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of staff turnover in the civil service on domain knowledge and subject expertise among senior civil servant 
 in july we launch a policy set the expect assignment duration for the senior   civil service the scs1 and scs2 role at a default minimum of year to support the transfer of knowledge management and subject expertise the initial impact of the policy will be review by july next year and there will be a full review in july follow the completion of the year cycle 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on his appointment and a very welcome it be too do he acknowledge that although the problem of churn and generalism in the civil service have be around for or year since the fulton inquiry in the 1960 under harold wilson it have become bad and bad i thank he for the evidence that the government have submit to the liaison committee ’s inquiry on strategic thinking in government and how select committees can well scrutinise it but if the government do not have in place the expert and the people with domain knowledge domain expertise and subject experience there be not likely to be much good strategic thinking go on give that ministers often seem to know more about the subject than the official they be deal with may i invite my right hon friend to give we a supplementary note for the inquiry so that we can understand their thinking on this matter more deeply 
 my hon friend obviously know a great deal about this as a result of his distinguished year of experience in the house but pivotal role allowance have be in place for year to help we to retain certain key individual a number of initiative be introduce by my distinguished predecessor lord maude the former right hon member for horsham and i intend to build on those but i be happy to engage with my hon friend because this be a serious issue 
 in the last year for which we have figure there be a turnover from the senior civil service and resignation be at we need to look carefully at what that mean across different role and at how we can retain the specialism for long period so that key government programme benefit from the sort of leadership that have endure expertise at the table.[official report   december vol c. 4mc 
 what step he be take to increase transparency of lobbying by business 
 the government outline wide range improvement to transparency in lobby in their policy statement strengthen ethics and integrity in central government which be publish in july they include revise guidance to widen the range of lobbying engagement declare by department and link reform of the consultant lobbying framework 
 if you be of the ten of thousand of small and medium sized enterprise bid for contract from the public sector you will be meet with a wall of bureaucratic paperwork design to prevent relationship between the contractor and the service provider if you be an ex prime minister you can make dozen of phone call on behalf of an interest in which you seem to have be involve include text to the current   prime minister be it not clear that that be reprehensible behaviour and that the lobbying rule allow it to happen when will the minister tighten the lobbying rule properly to prevent people from be able to benefit from the old system of it be not what you know but who you know 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer we have publish a document call strengthen ethics and integrity in central government 
 on small and medium sized enterprise i be delighted to be able to tell the hon gentleman that the procurement act which recently receive royal assent will make life much easy for sme that want to do business with the government and get a share of the £ of public procurement this government have to offer 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the accession of his majesty the king mark a new chapter in our nation ’s history this month the cabinet office launch a scheme to make new portrait of his majesty available to all public institution after the splendour of the coronation this be a fitting addition to the fabric of our public life 
 the cabinet office have also lead effort on artificial intelligence include set up a new ai incubator make up of a team of technical expert we will use our convening power to drive ai adoption across government 
 i ask my constituent who be sadly personally affect by the infected blood scandal what he want to hear from the government all he want be to see justice and receive assurance that nothing similar be ever allow to happen again follow on from question ask by my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson and for victim peace of mind can the minister ensure transparency in implement the inquiry ’s final recommendation so that ultimately this house can hold he accountable 
 the hon lady will have hear the answer give by my right hon friend the paymaster general he have give a clear commitment which i be very happy to endorse from the dispatch box on both transparency and speed of response that be the approach that he and i be pursue 
 my constituent who run small and medium sized enterprise constantly complain about their ability to get government contract the passing of the procurement act will obviously make that a lot easy will my right hon friend update the house on when that will be enact what will be the benefit to sme not only in my constituency but across the country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that the procurement act be a landmark piece of legislation that be go to   make life considerably easy for sme and it will do that in a number of way a new online procurement platform will make it easy for people to enter information once and use it many time and make it easy to see the pipeline of upcoming contract crucially contracting authority will also now have to have regard to the need of sme in order to break down barrier and give they a big share of the pie 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the paymaster general to his place in his new role he will have responsibility for the efficient delivery of government service and entitlement on which our constituent rely such entitlement of course be the winter fuel payment early this week he be report as say that some pensioner do not need the winter fuel payment so can he tell we which group of pensioner he have in mind when talk about who should lose the winter fuel payment 
 i be talk to a group of student and explain the complexity of make choice in my then role at the treasury as the chancellor set out yesterday although the government be fully commit to the full uplift use the triple lock and maintain all those benefit all government have to make choice i be make know my view on some of those choice and the challenge in deliver they i be not deviate at all from government policy and i be very happy to put the record straight on the floor of the house 
 mr speaker you may remember that early this year i reference a year old constituent who have complete the great north run have do a mile bike ride the year before and a mile walk the year before that we be compile a submission so that the gentleman could get an honour but unfortunately he pass away in the last couple of week give the extraordinary service that this veteran give to the country be there any route we can still follow to get some recognition for he in this unfortunate situation 
 may i begin by pay tribute to the extraordinary endeavour of my hon friend ’s constituent which i would never be able to achieve at any stage in life i be afraid that it be a general principle that honour be not give posthumously but we be in consultation with the palace to look at posthumous honour for people who have lose their life in public service we continue to keep this under review but it be a complex area 
 it may be true that the cabinet office ’s greensill inquiry establish that lord cameron have not break any lobbying rule or act unlawfully but a treasury committee report in find that he have not break the rule say that this reflect on the insufficient strength of the rule so what progress have be make to strengthen they what role will they play in measure the past activity of ministers who be to be appoint 
 i refer the hon gentleman to a write ministerial statement i make to the house a couple of month ago in which i explain how at   length we have implement many recommendation for example from the boardman review and other that include strengthen the civil service contractual requirement in relation to the advisory committee on business appointments and introduce a deed of covenant for ministers to uphold the finding of the advisory committee on business appointments i continue to engage with lord pickles who chair acoba about further such reform that can be undertake 
 the deputy prime minister play a prominent role at the artificial intelligence summit in bletchley park early this month big question be whether open source should be encourage and perhaps even require in order to encourage openness and innovation or whether it should be restrict to keep the model in the hand of know actor what be the direction of his thinking on that 
 as ever my right hon friend raise an erudite question my disposition and that of the government be that open source ai be an important basis upon which we can build many world lead application we can see company in this country grow at a fast pace by develop innovative ai off the back of open source of course there be risk associate with it but there be a high bar to be meet before the government would start impose additional regulatory burden on open source ai give the associated benefit for economic growth 
 palantir have this week receive of the large contract imaginable the company be base in silicon valley in california it be establish by the cia and it have continue link with the american defence network it look as though huge amount of british nhs money and profit will be migrate back across the pond to california but the most concern thing be that information about million of our fellow citizen their health datum will be handle by that company how can that be right 
 obviously any contract of any size that the government deal with the department of health and social care and the nhs in this case go through an extremely detailed and careful process in order to ensure that we get the good value for money for the british public that we help our public service solve the problem they face and that national security be maintain if the hon gentleman have a problem with a particular element of that contract he should bring it before the house otherwise i believe he be just scare- mongering 
 will my right hon friend help with a situation where thales the french defence contractor and its uk subsidiary be insist that material should be procure not from the uk but from india how be that consistent with the government ’s procurement policy 
 i can not comment on a specific case on the floor of the house but i be happy to engage with my hon friend on the matter he raise framework be in place but without know more detail it be impossible for i to comment here 
 the right hon member for salisbury john glen be the paymaster general since the contaminated blood inquiry report we have work together on mesothelioma and other issue so i know he be of good faith but my constituent fred bates who be a victim of the contaminated blood scandal be now and need to know whether he will get compensation before it be too late 
 i understand that and through the hon gentleman i say to mr bates that i be do everything i can to update the house as quickly as possible there be a range of activity that i be familiar with from the small ministerial group of which i be previously a part there be a lot of complexity in secure the envelope of money and then work out how to allocate it but i be do everything i can to bring that forward as quickly as possible 
 the life of all our constituent be greatly affect by public body that make decision across a whole range of issue would it be well for many of those public body to delegate their power to ministers so that member of this house can question and scrutinise those decision 
 i will conclude my initial meeting this afternoon with a briefing on arm ’s length body and the range of different entity that exist beyond whitehall i will think very carefully about what my hon friend have say and look at what more we can do to ensure that there be real accountability maximum productivity and efficiency draw on my experience up the road at the treasury 
 in and a half year in this house i have barely know a time when foreign policy be more important so will the secretary of state confirm that he be work with you mr speaker to find a way for elect member of this house to scrutinise the foreign secretary directly 
 i know that the procedure committee have be examine this subject and we continue to discuss it with you mr speaker there be a well establish convention whereby the office of foreign secretary have be hold by a member of the other place that have work well in the past but i know that my right hon friend the foreign secretary be committed to far increase his accountability to this place 
 we be both work on a solution 
 what step be the government take to reduce the number of civil servant in order to achieve value for money for the taxpayer 
 i be look carefully at where we be with the plan for this year obviously there be a half way point in that cycle and at what policy we can put in place at the beginning of october the chancellor announce a freeze on recruitment.[official report   december vol c. 5mc i will be look at what we need to do now to ensure that as we move into future financial year we use the benefit of efficiency that exist and different way of deliver service which we can learn from across the globe and the private sector so that we get value for money for all those who be employ and do a good job in the civil service 
 do the deputy prime minister think it be acceptable that baroness michelle mone have more ability to scrutinise the foreign secretary than members of this house 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer about the well establish principle that ministers can serve from the other place which i believe last happen when lord mandelson be in the labour cabinet however the government and my right hon friend the foreign secretary recognise this house ’s desire to scrutinise he and he have commit to further measure to ensure that happen 
 i thank the government for publish the report on governance and accountability in the civil service which my noble friend lord maude be commission to produce may i point out that of his recommendation in that very well draft report be about learn from the experience of other civil service such as those in new zealand australia and canada where indeed they retain civil servant in post much long by pay they well 
 order many member wish to speak but they will not get in if we be not careful 
 yes i acknowledge that the maude report have some very useful contribution i be reflect on that and will give a more substantial response and comment in due course 
 i listen very carefully to the paymaster general ’s reply to my colleague about the contaminate blood scandal can he guarantee that we will have a statement to the house before the christmas recess 
 no i can not guarantee that because i do not yet have collective agreement but i be work towards that ambition and that be what i want to achieve 
 why have scotland and wales be able to set up psychological support service for the victim of the contaminated blood scandal but england have not 
 it be because i have not yet secure collective agreement to do so the fund be available and it be absolutely right that we bring that forward as soon as possible again that be of the activity that i will be engage in resolve later this morning 
 far to the question from   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   and   the hon member for edmonton kate osamor what assessment have the minister make of the number of people who have sadly pass away this year due to infected blood before their compensation have be available for claim 
 i do not have that number for the hon gentleman but the point he make illustrate the urgency of the work in which i be engage and the need to ensure that over the next to working week by the expect date for the report ’s publication the government can bring forward a comprehensive response 
 we will now suspend until 
 sitting suspend 
 before we move to business question and resume the debate on the autumn statement i remind hon member that after they have speak in a debate or in question they must at the very minimum remain in the chamber for at least the next speech or the next question they must also return to hear the wind up speech from both the opposition spokesperson and the minister at the end of the debate it have get bad and it will not be tolerate 
 if for any reason a member be unable to return to the chamber for the wind up they be welcome to approach the chair and withdraw their request to speak in the debate record be keep when member speak and fail to return and this be take into account when decide whether to call member in subsequent debate both the minister and the opposition spokesperson respond to the debate be expect to remain in the chamber for the majority of the debate so that they can respond effectively to the point raise by other hon member

 the agreement of a cessation in hostility in gaza and israel to release hostage and tackle the urgent and unacceptable humanitarian catastrophe be welcome let we also hope that it could lead to a long last resolution will the government keep the house update as the situation develop there really should have be a statement this week and we really should be hear from the foreign secretary as we discuss last week member give careful consideration to these matter and want to raise their constituent concern 
 in a few case however we have see the legitimate lobbying of members by their constituent cross a line into intimidate protest and vandalism i thank the leader of the house you mr speaker house staff and the police for everything that they be already do to support member and their staff do the leader of the house agree that the spreading of misinformation and the whipping up of hate be a threat to our democracy much of it take hold on social medium platform give that the government water down the online safety act do she believe that they have the tool to deal with online hate misogyny antisemitism and islamophobia no long cover by the act 
 turn to yesterday ’s autumn statement do the leader of the house want to take this opportunity to correct the record because the chancellor do not seem to get his number right the real figure be publish by the office for budget responsibility alongside his statement and they do not match he say that it be 
 an autumn statement for growth”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 the obr say that growth have be downgrade in each of the next year he say that he be cut taxis the obr confirm that this will be the big tax raise parliament on record with worker now catch by stealth tax rise even with his cut to national insurance the government be hand back only £ for every £ they have take in this parliament 
 the chancellor say he be help with the cost of living crisis yet the office for budget responsibility say this be the large reduction in real living standard since record begin and energy price rise again today add more pain he say he have get inflation under control but the obr inflation forecast have now go up in every year of the forecast period with price rise high for long he say that debt have fall yet the obr say it would be high next year than when the tories come to power the prime minister say yesterday that he have reduce debt yet the institute for fiscal studies be clear that public sector debt be rise in cash term in real term and as a percentage of the national income perhaps those discrepancy be why the ifs ’s director say of the autumn statement that 
 a lot of these number be sort of make up 
 no matter what the government do at this late stage the fact for family will not change price be up tax be up debt be up mortgage be up rent be up that be their record and nothing they say this week can change it when people ask themselves whether they be well off after year of a conservative government the answer will be no 
 the late immigration figure be now out up again so much for the foreign secretary ’s plan to get number down to ten of thousand that be further evidence that this government can not stick to their promise and in next week ’s business there be still no sign of the emergency legislation on rwanda where be it what be the hold up be it with the leader of the house ’s parliamentary business and legislation committee or be with it the home office have she even see it she know it will not work it will absorb load of time and it will not solve the problem maybe the delay be because the home secretary reportedly think that the rwanda policy be batshit yesterday he also say that stockton be a shithole do the leader of the house agree that besmirch another hon member ’s constituency go against all the courtesy of this place and be utterly disrespectful to their constituent will she ensure that the home secretary come to this house and apologise that sort of foul language may be accurate when describe government policy but not the great town of stockton

 i owe you 
 i thank   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   for and join with the sentiment she express about israel and gaza we all hope that some of the hostage be able to be release in the come day and our thought be with everyone affect by that it be incredibly important that this house be keep up to date she will know that the procedure committee be look at that and will shortly make some announcement on how it think the foreign secretary can well come to answer question from hon member 
 this week i meet the director of national security and the director of consular and crisis service in the foreign office as well as home office official on behalf of member of this house to look at what they can do to support the family of hostage not just the british national but those who have a connection to the uk and i know that they be in touch with those hon member directly concern a lot of that can not be put in the public domain for obvious reason but they be in touch with hon member on privy counsellor term with thing that can not necessarily be put in the public domain 
 may i also thank the hon lady for what she say about security it be incredibly important i refer member to what i say last week on that point we should be free in this place to use our judgment and vote accordingly and we should not face intimidation for do our duty to this house although it be a grow and move challenge i be confident that we have the tool to tackle misinformation online she will know that we have stand up new service in the house of commons library strengthen its tie with government departments particularly the department for culture media and sport as well as with our security agency 
 the hon lady mention the fact relate to the autumn statement and the obr and i be happy to remind the house of those fact inflation be now at and will fall to and at the end of next year towards we will be back to headline debt be now by end of forecast down from a predict underlie debt next year be expect to fall to and we be due to meet our fiscal rule of have underlie debt fall as a percentage of gdp by the end of the next financial forecast we have the low debt in the g7

 on our ambition to grow the economy the hon lady will also know that we have a strong and resilient economy that fact be evidence by our continue to attract inward investment i very much welcome nissan ’s announcement of its commitment to continue make the qashqai and juke model in sunderland yesterday we make expense permanent as well as other measure to help business large and small particularly on our high street and in the hospitality sector we have new investment zone of which be in her beloved greater manchester 
 the hon lady mention stockton north which will benefit from £ of levelling up funding for billingham town centre with regard to the charge that she make against the home secretary he deny it and i believe he 
 the economy be predict to grow we would like it to grow fast and that be why we be focus on productivity we have be able to cut tax through the tough decision that have enable we to create that headroom we be able to do what we do during the pandemic on furlough and other support only because we pay down labour ’s deficit by labour have oppose every measure that   we have bring in to balance the book labour have block every measure to reform welfare in favour of deny people with disability the dignity of a pay packet 
 labour have block every measure to protect access to public service and cut waiting list in favour of militant union labour have block every measure to make we more energy secure in favour of just stop oil labour have block every measure to raise education standard and now wish to tax education and halve apprenticeship while we have be reduce fuel duty and hold down council tax labour put both up by and respectively where labour be now in power it tax the low pay out of work the ultra low emission zone have wreak havoc in london and cost livelihood sadly i understand that those measure will shortly be come to wales 
 labour members say that they have change but their action past present and plan for the future say otherwise further business will be announce in the usual way 
 i be delighted to inform the house that after year the crown jewel of darwen our freeman ’s casket and our mace will be return from blackburn to the darwen heritage centre after year of campaign myself i congratulate the heritage centre and all its volunteer on their work to secure they do my right hon friend agree that it be high time for a debate about local government reorganisation as well as get its crown jewel return darwen want to break free from blackburn which would truly be the crown glory of our £ town deal 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on a successful if lengthy campaign and i congratulate he and everyone who have work on it on their diligence and on never give up i do not know about a debate it sound like we ought to be have a party to celebrate this in all seriousness i know that it mean a tremendous amount to the local community they be know as the crown jewel locally i understand that some of they be very heavy if they need a hand carry they around i know someone who can help 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 thing become a bit clear for we all this week for a time we have be wonder what the leader of the house mean when she deliver her infamous stand up and fight battle cry she tell we time in second that she want to have a fight with somebody but we be not quite sure who the enemy in her head be we know in scotland that she like have a fight with we she be always tell we off for disobedience or treachery in tory britain we scot really should know our place but the chancellor helpfully reveal who else her government want to fight with 
 if you be unable to work because of ill health get ready for battle with the tories if you be among the family destitute in the uk forget it there will be no real help for you in your daily struggle to survive as be clear from the covid inquiry if you be a scientist or god forbid an actual expert gird your   loin in england tory fight nhs worker they fight teacher they fight local council they fight the low pay if you be on pension or benefit sure they throw you a few crumb yesterday from their table but the office for national statistics say that food price be high than they be year ago so they will fight you at the checkout till there be not a word about fight billionaire tax evasion fight dirty money be launder through london or fight the corruption and fraud drench this government in sleaze 
 when the chancellor sit down yesterday the independent obr assess that his measure would bring the large reduction in living standard since record begin but never mind i see the other place be debate the pedicabs london bill last night so we can all calm down know that this government be focus on the thing that really matter and people ask we why we want to see scotland independent and away from this bedlam of a place 
 i realise that i will wait in vain for any actual answer to these question question like how be it exactly that the right hon lady ’s government can find fiscal headroom in their budget when some of my constituent in edinburgh north and leith can not afford to feed themselves be it not time her profligate government stop fight everybody and hold an inquiry into themselves and the many billion they have squander over the last year 
 i be not in any doubt who i be stand up and fight for the people of this country and who i be stand up and fight against and the snp be on the latter list what the hon lady say be not the case she speak about the welfare measure that be announce yesterday she know that the closing claim measure do not apply in scotland and do not apply to anyone with disability or a child if she be not aware of that i ask she to please read the document that be put out yesterday and the chancellor ’s statement and if she do know that that be the case it would be helpful for she not to say otherwise 
 the hon lady list a number of thing and make various accusation i would ask she to be a little more self reflective it be her party that have be subject to and counting i think police investigation the serious fraud office be investigate gfg alliance the company to which the scottish national party give hundred of million of pound to guarantee job that never materialise and that just happen to be sponsor its party conference at the same time 
 the hon lady like to lecture my party about value which party be it whose leader smirk while people boo the national anthem which party be it whose activist call bbc reporter traitor which party be it that bully conservative party member attend a conference in scotland to the extent that it make national news which party be it whose behaviour be so horrific towards its own elect representative that they say they suffer panic attack and some have cross the floor who be responsible for the bile fuel rant that be so evident in hansard 
 once the hon lady have clock that the answer to all those question be her party she might reflect on why that be the case and on the appalling legacy that such a warped irresponsible displacement activity have seed to a generation of scottish child a wrecked education system a widen attainment gap few teacher math   score decline in every pisa survey science at a record low and plummet literacy rate but they will of course have somewhere safe and warm in which to take heroin i be not go to take any lecture from the hon lady about value responsibility or performance in office this be why i will get up every week and stand up and fight against the slopey shoulder separatism evidence by the snp 
 part of my constituency be fortunate still to be serve by a daily newspaper the grimsby telegraph the funeral of of its most distinguished journalist peter chapman take place early this week which cause i to reflect on the sadly decline role that local newspaper play in serve their community may we have a debate about the role of local newspaper and how they can help build the foundation of their local community 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue he be a huge champion for his local paper as he know the pro competition regime set out in the digital markets competition and consumers bill will help rebalance the relationship between the most powerful tech firm and those who rely on they include press publisher which will make an important contribution to the sustainability of the press the next department for culture media and sport question be not until the new year so i will make sure that the secretary of state have hear about his interest and if he wish to apply for a debate i be sure it would be very well attend 
 in north norfolk in east anglia we have some of the most important area for sugar beet in the entire country do the leader of the house think it be right for british sugar to bypass the national farmers union the beet grower sole representative in negotiation with the monopoly processor while negotiation be ongoing to get farmer to sign up to a contract that the majority of they do not believe be in their good interest or reflect an adequate return for the sugar market 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work he be do to support his farmer i know it be a lot he be a consistent champion for their interest and he be right to encourage they to stand firm i be pleased that nfu sugar and british sugar be resume negotiation on next year ’s sugar beet price and i hope they can work together to agree a mutually acceptable deal as soon as possible for the benefit of both grower and processor my hon friend may wish to raise this matter on   december   with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs 
 i call the chair of the backbench business committee 
 i be always very grateful mr speaker thank you very much 
 such a creep 
 well you know i see from the order paper that the committee of selection have do its business and hopefully the house will agree the membership of the backbench business committee on monday   night which will mean that it will be able to meet on tuesday afternoon i gather that the committee clerks already have a dozen application to be hear on tuesday afternoon so we look forward to get back to work we be also look to the leader of the house to award we a constant flow of time in which to air those debate both here in the chamber and in westminster hall 
 yesterday we hear that benefit will be uprate from april and national insurance will be reduce from january but overnight we also get news from ofgem that it intend to raise the energy price cap by from january an inordinate number of my constituent be already spend more on daily standing charge than they can afford to spend on heat their home and feed their family i understand that the government intend to look at this issue or be look at it but give what have happen in the last couple of day could i ask for that work to be speed up and do in anticipation of the price cap be raise in january 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the advert about the timetable for his committee be re establish which be very good news we will certainly as always make sure there be time for the debate that hon member wish to have 
 the hon gentleman will know from the answer i give to the shadow leader of the house that we have the energy price guarantee in place until the end of march next year but i know that the secretary of state for energy security and net will want to update the house on the ongoing work to which he allude i shall make sure that she have hear what he have say and of course he know how to raise it with she directly 
 over the last week we have see over innocent man woman and child kill hospital church mosque refugee camp and home attack numerous instance of war crime and food water power and medicine cut off in an act of collective punishment that be in violation of international law yet even as over people remain trap in the never end humanitarian nightmare in gaza we still have not have a substantial debate in this chamber on the conflict this be of the most important issue to my constituent and to constituent of many hon member so will the leader of house finally allocate government time for a substantial debate on this critical issue 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this i know that the situation in gaza particularly what we hope might happen over the come day be very much at the forefront of people ’s mind he will know and i have give many example the complexity of the situation there and what the israel defence forces be try to do in very difficult circumstance but of course we all want to see a pause in hostility to enable humanitarian assistance to get to where it need to be and we hope for hostage to be return home there have be a number of opportunity to discuss this on the floor of the house not least with the usual prime minister ’s question and other question to departments i shall make sure that the foreign secretary have hear what the hon gentleman have say and he will know that the door of consular service but also   of departments that be closely monitor what be happen on the ground be always open to member who have particular concern 
 may we have a debate on antisemitism at the football association the fa board which for year light up wembley for numerous cause and campaign have now say that it will not light up wembley ever again for any non entertainment reason this be because it have be sham by its antisemitic decision not to light up the stadium when jews be murder in the pogrom of   october should the national lottery even fund organisation that seem to regret every death and injustice apart from the death of jews 
 my right hon and learn friend the culture secretary discuss the lighting of the arch with the football association at the time and express her disappointment about how it approach that situation as be announce in the autumn statement we be make further fund available to combat the rise in antisemitism we be also repeat the £ uplift to the community security trust to fund its critical work to ensure that that work be able to continue and to meet the unfortunate demand however my right hon and learn friend make a very good point whatever business or organisation we be involve in we can all make a difference by call thing out while also critically show support to particular community i think his point be well make 
 may we have a debate on improve road safety i recently meet a community speedwatch group in bath a bunch of highly dedicated and motivated people who stand for hour in all weather face abuse they have catch speed vehicle yet they see very little result for their hard work speed kill a of road fatality be down to speeding would road safety week not be a perfect opportunity for such a debate to show that the government really take the issue of road safety seriously 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this very sadly timely question give the event of this week as she know speeding be a critical issue and of the big killer globally affect many country as well as measure we take at home she know that we make a big contribution to reduce the number of death on the road elsewhere it be an excellent topic for a debate i will download her interest to the secretary of state and i be sure that if she apply for a debate it would be well attend 
 my right hon friend have already mention the financial impact on poor family of the labour mayor of london ’s hat expansion of the ulez ultra low emission zone scheme but she be probably not aware that the advertising standards authority have find he guilty of use incorrect statistic in the scientific evidence which lead to its expansion give that authority across the country be now consider introduce similar scheme would it not be a good idea to have a debate in government time on ulez so that we can expose these lie for what they be 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that that be a very good idea and topic for a debate and he will know how to apply for there be scheme elsewhere in the country that address air quality issue which have choose a different path to clobber those who can least afford it with terrible unintended consequence people lose their business or livelihood charitable organisation be prevent from go about their work and the knock on economic impact to surround area it be not just those in london or potentially in certain part of wales who be to be affect by these scheme it be anyone who be go there to do business or for some other purpose it would be very good to have a debate on these matter there be good practice out there and there be also appal practice base on shoddy evidence and the mayor of london be the top candidate for that accolade 
 the chancellor say yesterday that he have take step to support people through the cost of living crisis create in downing street so why have citizen have to rely on food bank in the past month 
 as i state early the cost of live measure we have bring in now amount to £ we have be there through the immense crisis that be the pandemic and through furlough help people so that they could be at home and be support and also critically keep job and business go which be why we be of the fast recovery nation we have be there to pay energy bill i shall not repeat the statistic i give early but the hon lady will know that we have protect those on benefit and also pensioner through the triple lock and we be ensure that those who be on benefit and try to get into work have additional support to do so the result of our record be more people lift out of absolute poverty of whom be pensioner and nearly be child 
 the parliamentary and health service ombudsman have already find the department for work and pensions guilty of maladministration on count in relation to the waspi woman the women against state pension inequality campaign once in and the other in i forget who be in charge at the time it must be my age many woman have suffer as a result in a variety of way will the leader of the house agree to have a statement so that the government can show they be do what they can to help speed up the process at the ombudsman which appear to be take an inordinate amount of time in finalise its investigation and recommendation 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and the work he have be do campaigning on behalf of pensioner more broadly and his work on the triple lock as well as with respect to particular cohort of individual both his constituent and more widely the ombudsman ’s investigation be ongoing so it would not be appropriate for i to comment on that but i understand that it issue a statement on the timeline and the reason for the delay i will certainly make sure that it have hear what my hon friend have say today 
 i note that the leader of the house fail to respond to the question from my hon friend   the member for manchester central   lucy powell   about the government ’s rwanda policy the right hon lady will be aware of report that if as seem likely the government be unable to find a legal way to take that policy forward they be consider use the falkland islands as an alternative will she take this opportunity to either confirm or deny that the falkland islands be a possible alternative to rwanda 
 i be very happy to knock that on the head it be not an alternative to rwanda and nor be various other place that have be mention include the orkney islands that would be definitely out give the reliability of scottish national party ferry service 
 last sunday be international men ’s day which be a brilliant opportunity to highlight the positive contribution that man make to society as well as some of the challenge we face foremost among those be man ’s mental health and in particular the high rate of male suicide i recently visit conscious recovery an inspire blackpool charity that support those deal with mental health issue and raise awareness of those issue in our community will the leader of the house join i in thank and praise those brilliant volunteer and charity who do enormous work in this area and who make so much difference will she support a debate on improve mental health and prevent suicide 
 i thank the hon gentleman for champion conscious recovery in his constituency i be sure the whole house would want to thank all the volunteer who work for that organisation as well as those who work for many organisation across the country and in our own constituency too i be pleased that he have be able to raise the profile of this important issue and i thank he for his campaign work on it it be critical particularly for young man who be very vulnerable to not open up about their mental health issue often with terrible consequence we should applaud all effort to ensure that they get the help and intervention they need 
 far to early exchange many of we have constituent stick inside the hell that be gaza and in try to get they out we be struggle to get information out of the foreign commonwealth and development office i have always find   the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell   to be an honourable and honest man and he be do his good to help to get people out but it be still difficult get that information could we have a statement or at least a write statement set out the channel that might be open to we so that we can get people home 
 i will certainly make sure that the foreign office have circulate an update contact list to all member of this house we will make sure that be do the consular service be the good point of contact in most case for hon member but in the meeting i speak about early in this session i also emphasise the importance of the foreign office and in some case the home office make sure that they be in regular touch with member who have a particular interest in this issue i would be happy after this session to ensure that the foreign office get in touch with the hon gentleman to talk about any issue he need support with

 every option must be on the table in order to secure the hundred of highly skilled job base at the grangemouth complex for the long term 
 will the leader of the house bring forward a debate in government time to consider the economic impact of uk energy policy on the people of scotland
