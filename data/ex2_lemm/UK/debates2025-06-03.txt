 do the minister agree that probation service in north down and across the uk often exceed their duty provide extensive support to individual in need furthermore do he agree that it be essential to allocate resource for substance abuse treatment so that young offender have access to personalised service 
 i agree wholeheartedly it be very important that substance abuse be properly tackle probation service and youth offend team do a lot of work in that space 
 what step she be take to support survivor of domestic abuse and violence against woman through the criminal justice system 
 what step her department be take to support victim of domestic abuse 
 the government be take action to support victim of domestic abuse and violence we be ensure strong management of domestic abuse perpetrator through new domestic abuse protection order and the increase multi agency management of domestic abuser that be be expand to those convict of coercive and control behaviour in response to the sentencing review publish last week i commit to further protection for victim include the roll out of domestic abuse specialist court and well identification of domestic abuse perpetrator 
 my constituent be subject to financial physical and emotional abuse by her ex she be also cyber stalk her social medium account be hack for detail of her location and for information about their child despite be grant a non molestation order and a prohibit step order she be unable to compile sufficient evidence of the cyber stalking to be grant a stalk protection order speak to she her fear be palpable what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that victim be support in compile the evidence that they need for a stalk protection order 
 i be very sorry to hear of the experience of the hon lady ’s constituent it be clearly a horrifying case and my sympathy be with she give that stalk protection order be relatively new there be a case for continually examine whether their roll out be work as intend they be primarily a home office responsibility but there be amendment to the crime and policing bill which be go through the house that be design to strengthen these order if the hon lady will write to i i will ensure that she have a meeting with the relevant minister to talk through the specific of the case that she have raise and the lesson that can be learn as we strengthen these order for everyone 
 in april the metropolitan police commissioner warn that without additional funding london will see a sustained increase in violence against woman and girl my right hon friend the secretary of state have be work tirelessly to fix the broken system leave by the conservatives but if we do not get that support in london woman will go unprotected will she commit to work with colleague in the home office and the treasury to ensure that the met can keep woman safe in my constituency and across london 
 of course we work closely with colleague in the home office and the treasury the government will shortly publish the outcome of the spending review but i can assure my hon friend that all colleague across government be commit to our mission to halve violence against woman and girl for victim not just in london but across the country i will ensure that we engage with member across the house on this matter as well 
 what step her department be take to help to reduce reoffende by people on probation 
 we inherit a justice system in crisis with prison churn out well criminal not well citizen and we know that of offender be reoffender last week i announce measure to toughen up community punishment which result in low reoffende rate than short custodial sentence we will also increase probation investment to manage offender in the community safely 
 will the lord chancellor outline the step be take to recruit and retain probation officer and to ensure that they have manageable caseload and that their morale be improve what programme or partnership be in place to help those on probation to access stable accommodation and employment training or education so that they can go through the rehabilitation process and reduce their chance of reoffende 
 we be invest in probation funding will increase by £ by the final year of the spending review that be a increase in annual budget which will fund further recruitment on top of the officer we will recruit this year and the officer we recruit in the previous year that will support our investment in service that rehabilitate offender and cut crime 
 the lord chancellor admit in a recent interview with the times that her sentencing reform will create inevitable tension with the government ’s effort to halve knife crime and rate of violence against woman and girl it sound like she do not really believe in these reform which have be trot out by david gauke the prisons minister in the other place and the prison reform trust do the lord chancellor realise that none of they be elect and that if this package fail to keep our street safe and restore the criminal justice system the country will hold she and this government to account 
 i think the country will hold to account those responsible for the absolute mess that this government inherit nowhere in the right hon gentleman ’s question do he acknowledge that under the government of which he be a member and for which he campaign prison be bring to the brink of collapse these reform be necessary this government will not allow our prison to run out of place the thing everybody agree we can not allow to happen the only reason that be a possibility be because of the tory party 
 when the minister of state for courts and legal services plan to meet the hon member for horsham ’s constituent andrew turner to discuss locked child trust fund 
 i be well aware of the hon gentleman ’s campaign to support young adult who lack mental capacity in access their child trust fund i know that he meet my predecessor and follow work that i be carry out with counterpart in other department i will be very pleased to meet he 
 my constituent have be through no few than justice secretaries look for a solution to the problem of lock child trust fund he have have to start over again each time from scratch will the minister give i and mr turner a clear understanding of what exactly the legal impediment be to a solution and of what part of government the objection be come from so that we can make a legal challenge to it if necessary 
 the hon member will understand as will mr turner that we have to balance the desire to support young adult who lack capacity in access what be their property by right with the need to ensure that everybody who need to access those child trust fund have the proper legal authority to do so safeguard need to be in place not least to ensure that those vulnerable adult be protect from economic abuse that be why we must work very carefully across government to ensure that those protection be keep in place 
 what step her department be take to ensure adequate monitoring of the community accommodation service tier 
 we inherit a system in which far too many people leave prison with no fix address individual in community accommodation service tier be risk assess by probation and subject to ongoing monitoring supplier work closely with probation to deal robustly with any behavioural concern pose by resident 
 thanet house in leatherhead have rightly be withdraw from the cas3 scheme follow serious concern include about drug dealing antisocial behaviour and safeguard risk despite raise my constituent concern numerous time i have receive no response from the probation delivery unit will the secretary of state ensure that robust monitoring and clear accountability be in place across all cas3 property and commit to ensure that the probation service respond promptly to concern raise by mps and local resident 
 it be important that the probation service deal with any concern promptly and effectively the department write to the hon lady on   april   with further detail in relation to her concern and thanet house be withdraw from the scheme on   may 
 what discussion she have have with victim group on the early release of violent offender 
 what discussion she have have with victim group on the early release of violent offender 
 a victim representative be on the panel that conduct the independent sentencing review which gather view from victim and survivor i personally meet a number of victim and victim group and feed their view directly back to david gauke those serve sentence for more serious sexual and violent offence will spend at least of their sentence in custody 
 the victim commissioner say that the early release of prisoner risk victim safety so will the lord chancellor explain why she be put violent offender ahead of victim 
 that be not the case what would be fail victim be if our criminal justice system get to the point of collapse and we do not have prison place for violent offender this government be get on with reform our criminal justice system we be put victim at the heart of it to protect they and be make sure that we never run out of prison place again 
 the prisoners disclosure of information about victims act otherwise know as helen ’s law should prevent the early release of murderer who do not disclose the location of their victim remain however there be loophole in the law in case where the murderer make a disclosure but no remain be find as happen in the case of jean taylor ’s daughter chantel will the minister meet i and jean taylor who found the charity family fight for justice to close those loophole 
 i thank the right hon member for her question all my sympathy go to her constituent if she want to write to i with the detail i will definitely look into the case and come back to she 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the previous government release prisoner in an indiscriminate way this government have develop a more organised approach but the progression model of sentencing recommend by the independent sentencing review and welcome by the government could mean less clarity for victim about when perpetrator leave prison give the concern express by victim group what safeguard and resource will the minister put in place to prepare victim and assure they of their safety 
 i thank the chair of the justice committee for that important question it be vital that victim be notify that be why we be boost probation and ensure that victim liaison officer have that vital information he will be aware that in our victims and courts bill which have be present to this house we be introduce a new victim notification scheme and a dedicated helpline to ensure that victim get the vital information that they so desperately need 
 in march i meet people from the justice for victims campaign group family tell i that their young daughter be kill by an unlicensed uninsured driver they be ask to alter their victim impact statement several time to avoid offend the defendant and be deny the chance to fully express their grief that experience be share by many other will the justice secretary take step to ensure that victim family have full autonomy over their statement so that they can express their experience freely in court 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i also have the privilege of meet those family in march and i hear their concern i know personally how important victim personal statement   be to ensure that victim and family voice be hear i do not want there to be any circumstance in which they feel unable to make a statement however these statement be consider evidence and the rule of admissibility apply as they do to all witness statement that be a matter for the court but we will keep look at the issue 
 i call the shadow justice secretary 
 can i say how sorry i be to hear that the minister be the subject of intimidation and an attack on her office i think all of we across the house would like to wish she and her staff well and to say how pleased we be that the vile individual behind this have be catch and punish 
 in september the justice secretary design an early release scheme for prisoner she let out lawson natty who supply the machete use to kill a year old and adam andrews who shake a baby so violently that he be leave blind and paralyse she be now halve prison sentence for killer and rapist while lucy connolly remain behind bar for a reprehensible but swiftly delete tweet do the justice secretary really believe that her choice be make the public safe 
 this government be make choice to keep this country safe and be clean up the mess leave after the previous government lead our criminal justice system to rack and ruin they leave this government to make the difficult decision when we come into office that be necessary to prevent the total collapse of our criminal justice system it be worth remind the house again because the conservatives seem to have very short memory that they only build an additional prison place this government be roll up our sleeve and get on with the difficult job of build the prison place necessary to keep violent offender in prison while put victim back at the heart of our criminal justice system 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 between october and june the last conservative government release offender under their early release scheme and refuse to exempt domestic abuser from early release to the horror of survivor and victim charity the government have make no such exclusion from their early release scheme so far but they have the chance to put that right via the new domestic abuse identifier that they be introduce after lot of campaigning by the liberal democrats and other will the minister today give survivor and victim charity a commitment that as soon as the identifier come into force it will be use to exempt domestic abuser from early release in the way that the last government fail to 
 i thank the hon member for point out the failure of the previous government and their refusal to exempt domestic abuser and offender who have commit violence against woman and girl from their early release scheme this government ensure that measure be in place to ensure that victim be keep safe he will know the importance of the new domestic abuse identify tool that we be bring forward it be a vital for identify and track datum   through the criminal justice system and it will be important as we go forward with the review that we be put in place 
 if her department will take step to increase sentence for high street crime 
 this government inherit a situation in which of offender account for of all offence with a small number of repeat offender wreak havoc in our community and on our high street crack down on these offender be a central part of any successful strategy to cut crime and we will accept david gauke ’s recommendation particularly on the further roll out of intensive supervision court however the hon member must accept the reality of the inheritance leave by his government which include an increase in sentence although they deliver only prison place over their year in power 
 south shropshire resident would expect high street crime to be deal with and proportionate sentencing and appropriate deterrent how will remove short term prison sentence achieve any of that 
 the hon member should know that of all people who be give a short custodial sentence go on to reoffend within the year so clearly the system that we have do not work we can not simply sit back and keep do thing that we know result in increase reoffende in community that we all want to protect we have to look at intervention that will make a difference tough community punishment produce well reduction in reoffende than short sentence we will consult member across the house as we prepare our bill in the come week to make sure that we have a strong package of unpaid work and other measure design to toughen up community punishment 
 do the lord chancellor agree that when it come to sentencing ancillary order include those ban offender from shop and high street be part of the answer we need the police together with the crown prosecution service to apply for they and when an offender appear in court we need the court to issue those order when sentence 
 my hon friend raise an important point he be right that so call ancillary order often refer to as travel ban ban from see football and ban on the ability to go to particular area be an important part of the package of measure that the gauke review have recommend we have accept those in principle and i look forward to work with my hon friend and other colleague as we draw up our package of proposal for the upcoming sentencing bill 
 i call the shadow minister 
 whatever the sentence or offence victim and family deserve a meaningful and fair route to appeal sentence that be unduly lenient day for people who have   experience deep trauma when criminal get an unlimited time to appeal be not meaningful or fair can the lord chancellor explain to campaigner such as katie brett and ayse hussein from justice for victims why she be not willing to give they more time 
 the shadow minister should know that the law commission be consider the whole area of unduly lenient sentencing it be important that we let it do its work and that it be able to look at the measure in the round and think about the consequence across the whole criminal justice system we will review those proposal once they be make and legislate if we need to 
 i be afraid that that explanation will not wash the lord chancellor know that she be choose to give the government more time in her bill ahead of the law commission ’s decision why be she give herself more time but not victim 
 if the shadow minister ever do any homework he would know that it be always the attorney general who have to agree and sign off on unduly lenient sentencing referral our proposal be there to make sure that the attorney general always have a full day period to consider and make ruling that often help victim he will also know that the law commission be look at that work the conservative government have year why do they never do anything 
 what step her department be take to help support victim of sexual abuse 
 we fund key support service such as independent sexual violence and domestic abuse adviser the crown prosecution service have introduce victim liaison officer to ensure that victim of rape and serious sexual offence have a consistent point of contact throughout the criminal justice system we will also provide free transcript of sentencing remark for victim of rape and serious sexual offence and we will introduce independent legal adviser for all adult rape victim 
 on the last government ’s watch the backlog of crown court case rise to record level leave too many victim include those in macclesfield to wait year for their day in court that backlog include victim of sexual abuse unable to begin properly process their trauma until their trial be over and stick in a horrifying limbo what step be the government take to ensure that victim of sexual abuse be not leave wait for year to see justice do 
 my hon friend be right as the house know justice delay be justice deny that be why this government have double magistrate sentencing power and fund a record number of sit day however the scale of the challenge be beyond what increase sitting day can achieve alone that be why we have ask sir brian leveson to propose bold and ambitious reform to deliver swifter justice for victim as part of the government ’s plan for change 
 in recent week daniel clarke a vile sexual offender be sentence to year in prison for horrific act of sexual abuse against vulnerable child many with special need and many of whom be my constituent indeed there be suspect case i have be contact by the family of those innocent victim who have express outrage at the shockingly lenient sentence i write to the attorney general on   may   ask for the case and the sentence to be review i do not receive a response and have to find out through the bbc that the review be happen nevertheless i be pleased that the sentence be be review will the minister give assurance to my constituent the house and the british public that such vile sexual predator will have the book throw at they and that protect our child be the only thing that matter 
 i thank the hon member for raise that case i be pleased that the review be take place victim of child sexual abuse be victim of some of the most heinous crime in our society that be why it be important that we get on with address the recommendation of the alexis jay review we be put measure in our crime and policing bill and strengthen the victims and courts bill to ensure that victim of such crime be put at the heart of the criminal justice system and that the perpetrator feel the full force of the law 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of review sentencing for peaceful protester 
 it be a long stand tradition in this country that people be free to peacefully protest and demonstrate their view provide they do so within the law when people break the law sentencing be a matter for the court which have a range of power to deal with offender effectively and appropriately 
 peaceful protest be a cornerstone of a functioning and healthy democracy but people in stroud and across the country feel that the legislation pass by the conservatives in limit the right to peacefully protest of my constituent adam beard with whom i have work for over year in my gp surgery be convict and sentence to a year in prison for plan a peaceful protest give all the prison overcrowding will the minister consider whether peaceful protester could at least avoid custodial sentence 
 the right to peacefully protest be a cornerstone of our democracy as my hon friend rightly say and this government will protect and preserve that right the post legislative scrutiny of the public order act begin this month and we will carefully consider the result of that review along with the recommendation of the independent sentencing review 
 while we might not agree with their method peaceful protest can take many form include the burning of religious   text do the minister agree that freedom of expression must be protect and that any move by parliament or the court to introduce a blasphemy law would undermine it 
 the hon member will be reassure to know that we do not have a blasphemy law in this country and that be the right and proper position 
 if she will take step to allow humanist celebrant to conduct legally bind wedding 
 humanist have long campaign to conduct legally bind wedding and we be grateful for the contribution they make to our society marriage be an important institution and we have to consider any change carefully the government will set out our position on wedding reform in due course 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests i understand that minister be focus on wide marriage reform but there be a much quick and simple process by which to enable humanist marriage which be to act on the high court ruling of that the current law be discriminatory will ministers therefore lie an order so that humanist couple and celebrant can have legal recognition for their ceremony in line with their belief the same as their religious counterpart 
 no will be more excited to don a hat for the legally bind humanist wedding than i however we must consider whether legislate to provide for humanist marriage would introduce further differential treatment in this complex area of law that be why we need to make sure that we take the time to get this right it would also not address other issue in marriage law that affect all group as a responsible government we have to consider this before we set out our position i appreciate that mean that the hon lady will have to wait just a little bit long 
 what step her department be take to support the operation of hmp lewes 
 since the disappointing inspection in healthcare improvement funding have be put in place as have mobile phone detection equipment to disrupt illicit activity hmp lewes ’s most recent inspection in be encouraging and highlight the strength of the invigorated leadership team his majesty ’s prison and probation service be continue to closely monitor and support the prison 
 the late inspection of hmp lewes find that level of violence self harm and drug use remain notably bad than at other reception prison with just of prisoner engage in education or employment and many spending as little as hour a day out of their cell while the new governor have be praise for make some real improvement the prison   be still describe as be trap in a cycle of boredom short staffing and drug misuse what specific step be the government take to support the governor ’s effort to ensure that these early improvement can be turn into last change 
 it be important that hmpps continue to monitor the prison carefully and the chief operating officer ’s visit on   may   find a number of further improvement if the hon gentleman want to write to i i can send he a full update on the action be take in relation to that prison 
 on the topic of prison operation we need effective scrutiny of privatised contract for prison maintenance because those contract have be detrimental for prison will the minister release the last government ’s report recommend more privatisation of prison maintenance suitably redact if necessary for full transparency and to avoid any accusation of a cover up 
 my hon friend will be well aware that a lot of the information be commercially confidential but we be invest up to £ in to keep our prison be safe and secure and we have a prison estate condition survey programme in place to well understand our estate 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of rehabilitative programme in prison 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of rehabilitative programme in prison 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of rehabilitative programme in prison 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential merit of increase support for rehabilitation programme 
 a key priority of this government be that our prison rehabilitate offender make they well citizen rather than well criminal i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the fantastic prison staff who mentor and support prisoner in custody every day i see at hand the benefit of the create future opportunity programme when i visit hmp humber in april 
 prison have an important role in protect the public and punish criminal but they be also vital to rehabilitation give that around half of prisoner reoffend within a year of be release what step be the government take to ensure that programme to address mental health addiction and education be not only available but effective and consistently deliver across the prison estate include in our prison in winchester 
 the hon member be right to emphasise all those programme they be clearly extremely important and we publish and monitor a range of performance metric link to rehabilitative programme delivery include employment at week and month post release or at the start of a community order and engagement with substance misuse treatment all those measure be in place and be properly monitor but as always there be more to be do in this area 
 in my constituency of mid dunbartonshire the community justice team be have some success in prevent reoffende by work with offender in a trauma inform way give the success of that trauma inform approach to rehabilitation what discussion have the minister have regard the differ approach that be take to offender rehabilitation across the uk 
 the hon member be right to highlight the good work go on in her constituency as i say i see trauma inform activity in operation at hmp humber it be something we need to learn from across the prison estate 
 dyslexia be vastly over represent in the prison population while of the general population be dyslexic it be think that as many as half of all prisoner have dyslexia do the minister consider rehabilitation programme to effectively meet the specific need of dyslexic prisoner 
 the hon member be right to highlight dyslexia and neurodiversity be common among people in our prison that be why we have neurodiversity officer in each prison to ensure that we be do our very good for these people so that they can be rehabilitate and become well citizen when they come out of prison 
 the former chief inspector of prison say that landworks in my constituency 
 provide of the good example in the country of how we can reduce reoffende turn live around and prevent future victim 
 its reoffende rate be just the government have announce £ towards prison build over the next year when will they commit to invest in project like landworks that can radically reduce the prison population transform the life of offender and cut crime 
 sector organisation like landworks deliver valuable rehabilitation wellbee support and advocacy service across england and wales and they partner effectively with hmpps in many different way the work of key organisation like the the hon member mention be incredibly important and essential in reduce reoffende and we continue to invest in it i would be happy to meet she to discuss the matter far and see what more can be do 
 lack of work be a key driver of reoffende derby medical manufacture company pennine healthcare have some offender who work for the company on day release but it be explore a project to manufacture in prison provide skill and potential work on release do the minister agree that rather than the continue revolving   door of reoffende we need to ensure that there be both punishment and meaningful rehabilitation may i invite the minister to visit and learn more about the project 
 my hon friend highlight yet another piece of excellent work that be go on across our prison estate in partnership with other organisation again if she write to i i would be happy to allow my diary manager to see how my diary be perform 
 the north east charity nepacs run departure lounge across prison in the north east include at hmp holme house which serve teesside its work be critical in give prison leaver a central point of support to prevent reoffende and help they reintegrate into society but the probation service have cut its funding and it face closure will the minister meet i to talk about how the increase funding that we be provide to the probation service can be use to protect this vital service 
 my hon friend highlight another excellent piece of work that be go on and the difficulty in ensure that funding be effectively use as we move forward in a difficult situation due to the funding inheritance that we have from the previous government if he write to i about that particular case i will be very happy to meet he 
 prison have purpose rehabilitation and punishment we need offender to pay back to the community and individual they have harm i welcome my hon friend ’s action to punish offender in the community can i give he a list of all the pothole that need fill in norfolk 
 my hon friend can write to i with his list of pothole and we will see what we can do 
 what discussion she have have with the sentencing council on sentence guideline for immigration offence 
 minister meet regularly with the chair of the sentencing council on the specific guideline for immigration offence the hon member will know that they set a minimum sentence but no maximum judge can still sentence as they see fit within the limit of what the law allow and foreign criminal can still be deport even if they be sentence to less than month 
 as the shadow justice secretary hear when he visit on friday criminal gang be impose a significant cost on hillingdon which have the high level of asylum seeker per capita of any local authority because the council have to support asylum seeker who have be smuggle into the uk what plan do the justice secretary have to ensure that we have tough sentence that be fit for purpose so that our community do not face this burden in the future 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that i and colleague in the justice department be work closely with our colleague in the home department to make sure that we have a join up approach to tackle the issue he have raise he know that asylum be primarily a policy issue for the home secretary and i will make sure that she and her team be make aware of the specific problem in hillingdon that he have raise today 
 i call the shadow justice secretary 
 for the time the sentencing council have publish immigration sentencing guideline they water down sentence pass by parliament which mean that hundred of illegal migrant every year will avoid the threshold for automatic deportation once again the justice secretary ’s official be in the meeting and wave the guideline through and i have the minute to prove it have the justice secretary lose control of her department once again or be it the case that as the defence secretary say on sunday this government have simply lose control of our border 
 no what this government be do be clean up the almighty mess leave to we by the previous government of which the right hon gentleman be a member he know full well that i have already signal an intention to review the power of the sentencing council we have an upcoming sentencing bill and i will take the action that he and his government never do in long year interruption he have suddenly find his voice he do not have it for a decade or more 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of the report of the justice committee of session on ipp sentence hc publish on september 
 we continue to support ipp offender through our update action plan which contribute to a decrease in ipp offender in prison in the last year but we will not put public protection at risk the prisons minister in the other place and i continue to meet regularly with mp peer and other stakeholder to work together on support this cohort 
 it be and a half year since ipp sentence be describe as not defensible and be abolish for offender but people remain incarcerated under these sentence just few than in june when the justice committee report in its key recommendation be that the government legislate to enable a resentencing exercise for these individual will the minister please set up an expert committee to at least advise on how to bring forward a resentencing exercise urgently 
 it be right and proper that ipp sentence be abolish various organisation have consider resentence none of they have identify   an approach that would not involve release offender whom the parole board have determine pose too great a risk to the public we do not wish to give false hope to those serve the sentence by establish an expert panel but we will continue to work robustly with this group and do everything in our power to address the problem that we recognise 
 what step her department be take to   help   support ex offender into employment 
 this government ’s plan to support woman be clear and ambitious the aim be to reduce the number of woman go to prison our woman ’s justice board will support that the independent sentencing review ’s recommendations—[interruption i be on the wrong question apology interruption well you get a preview of the next answer mr speaker 
 we be committed to ensure that offender leave prison with the job and skill need to lead law abide life that be why we have launch regional employment council which for the time bring business together with prison probation and the department for work and pensions to support offender in the community 
 we get there eventually employment be crucial to reduce reoffende and data show that offender who be employ within week of leave prison have a reoffende rate around half of those out of work will the minister outline how the regional employment council include in southport and the liverpool city region at large will help to drive down reoffende 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that secure employment be know to reduce the risk of reoffende significantly the minister for prison in the other place have lead a business with a track record of get offender into employment and i understand that national highways be start to build strong partnership as chair of the employment council in manchester merseyside and cheshire 
 i thank the minister for his answer to help offender into employment they need to have the opportunity of training while in prison and whenever they leave prison to go back into the society where they live they need someone there to oversee they and ensure they be follow the right path will the minister outline how the government will ensure that that be the case he be a good minister so will he share his idea with the policing and justice minister in northern ireland to ensure that the good thing that happen here can happen in northern ireland as well 
 i be very happy to share good practice across northern ireland and other region of the uk so that we can all learn from another and official meet in the nation group as the hon gentleman well know he be right to say that we need to ensure that people be support as they move into the community that be why we be invest in probation   as my right hon friend the lord chancellor say onboarde more than probation officer this year and another next year 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 my hon friend have have a preview of this answer this government ’s plan to support woman be clear and ambitious the aim be to reduce the number of woman go to prison our woman ’s justice board will support that the independent sentencing review ’s recommendation on short defer and suspend sentence for woman which we have accept in principle will reduce the number of woman in prison we have also take decisive action by immediately accept susannah hancock ’s recommendation no long to place woman in young offender institution 
 i thank the minister for his preview as chair of the all party parliamentary group on woman affect by the criminal justice system i welcome the independent sentencing review ’s final report i note that the review encourage the government to consider introduce statutory defence for victim of domestic abuse include where coercion have be a factor in their offending to prevent unnecessarily criminalise they will the government look far at those proposal 
 yes the government will look far at those proposal the women ’s justice board have be create to do exactly that sort of work and we also have an excellent victims minister in my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones 
 in march the government announce that girl will no long be place in young offender institution how will the minister monitor the implementation of that policy and how will he ensure the public be protect from the small number of violent girl who need to be detain 
 every week i get a report of the number of girl in our youth estate so i be monitor it there be no girl in a yoi and there have not be since the girl who be in a yoi move out soon after we come into government

 i call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party 
 do the secretary of state agree with the chair of the prison governors association that the conservative proposal to arm prison officer with lethal weapon be just headline grab nonsense do she agree that on top of provide   body armour the serious mean to protect prison officer be by ensure that they get the year long training they deserve not the week long crash course that the last government leave they with

 i thank my hon friend for that vital question we be give judge the statutory power to order offender to attend their sentencing hearing we be also make it clear that reasonable force can be use where it be necessary and proportionate to do so to ensure that any adult offender attend when order to do so i pay tribute to the family of jan mustafa zara aleena and sabina nessa as well as to the family of olivia pratt korbel who have all fight tirelessly to bring about this law this be a law for all of the victim and it be in their memory that we bring it forward 
 across my constituency i hear the same thing from parent school staff and youth worker early sign of offend behaviour be often miss or not act on until it be too late and in rural area stretch service and limited access to youth provision make the problem bad give the success of the haslemere youth hub will the lord chancellor consider expand community base justice scheme to ensure young people be not draw into the criminal justice system when they do not need to be 
 the hon gentleman be right that those sort of scheme be exactly what be need that be why we have increase funding for youth offend team and protect funding for the turnaround scheme which be highly successful in move people who be on the edge of youth crime away from crime we be continue with that funding and we have the young futures prevention partnership come in 
 a constituent who come to see i recently be significantly impact by find out about the release of somebody who have perpetrate a non violent but heinous crime against he what more can we do to ensure that all victim be notify when the perpetrator be release 
 my sympathy be with my hon friend ’s constituent it be vital that victim be notify those victim who be currently eligible for the victim notification scheme should be give a victim liaison   officer to find out about their case but we know that there be more to do we be bring forward a new victim notification scheme in our victims and courts bill which will for the time provide a dedicated helpline to get such information to victim and survivor 
 the secretary of state recently announce that paedophile will be castrate ahead of early release from prison which turn out to be nothing more than take some pill that may i repeat may”—reduce their libido will the secretary of state confirm here and now that no paedophile prisoner will be release from prison early until it have be prove that the medication have effectively castrate they 
 chemical suppression be a mechanism use by other jurisdiction around the world and it have be show to work the previous government sit on a pilot for year on end and do nothing i have say that i will pull every lever at our disposal to deal with sex offending once and for all

 my hon friend be right to highlight an absolutely appalling case and the thought of everyone in this house be with the child who be victim of that abuse the independent judiciary have rule on this this government believe in transparency in our family court and that be why we be work to expand the use of transparency order but we have to respect the independence of our judiciary which have rule in this particular case not least for the reason of protect the child in that case 
 lord hermer say that we be not even try to reform the convention why not 
 i do not know what the right hon member be refer to because the government have already announce that we be consider the way in which our human right law be apply in immigration case i be the policy owner for the european convention on human right and i be consider its application within our domestic law as well i do not know what other reassurance he need 
 i welcome the lord chancellor ’s commitment to tighten up exclusion zone knowsley have some of the high rate of domestic abuse in the country so that kind of action will be important for victim do she agree that an offender ’s freedom should never come before a victim ’s right to feel and be safe 
 my hon friend raise such an important point i have be strike by so many meeting with victim in which they feel that the exclusion zone   as currently construct effectively make they constrain rather than the offender that be why i want to move to restriction zone for offender and we will bring forward our proposal in the upcoming sentencing bill 
 rural community often find it even more difficult to access legal aid provider than in urban area what step be the minister take to help to provide access to legal aid to people in rural area 
 it be vital that those who need legal aid some of the most vulnerable people in our society can access it we be fund provision such as advicenow which be an online provision we also ensure through our contracting process through the legal aid agency that there be provision right across the country to ensure that no include those in rural area struggle to access legal aid

 my constituent ’s child be the victim of a serious sexual offence several year ago by the time the case come to trial next year it will have be nearly half a decade since the assault take place do the lord chancellor think that that be an appropriate length of time for a child to have to wait to seek justice what word of comfort can she give to my constituent 
 the hon lady highlight an absolutely appalling case if she be ask whether i think that be acceptable the answer be no as my hon friend the victims minister say justice delay be justice deny it be for that reason that we have ask sir brian leveson to recommend bold and fundamental reform the hon lady have just describe the human consequence of the crown court backlog that we inherit from the past government and we will fix the mess 
 last week i visit meadow road youth centre to see the fantastic work that lloyd and other youth worker be do to provide an outlet for young people however it could be close down due to funding uncertainty do the minister agree that sporting centre such as that reduce youth offend and be hub for rehabilitation will my hon friend commit to dudley get its fair share of funding and to keep the centre open 
 centre such as the that my hon friend describe in her constituency do excellent work and help to reduce youth offending if she write to i about the case that she refer to i will look into it 
 my constituent charlotte a victim of abuse herself have long campaign for justice through transcript and highlight how they can help victim to move forward with their life how can we ensure that victim be provide with sentencing remark even if the accuse be acquit in a rape case 
 the ministry of justice currently provide free sentencing remark for victim of murder and manslaughter as of last month we have make permanent our pilot to provide those sentencing remark to victim of rape the hon lady will understand that provide full transcription be a costly exercise which be why we be undertake testing of artificial intelligence to make transcript available in future in a low cost and timely manner 
 at just year old my constituent be subject to horrific abuse by a family member who be ultimately convict of offence include count of rape the offender be sentence in youth court to just a year referral order and a year restraining order my constituent can not appeal this sentence under the unduly lenient sentence scheme simply because of the court in which the case be hear will the minister review this deeply troubling case and consider extend the unduly lenient sentence scheme to include youth court rape conviction 
 i hope that my hon friend hear the early answer on the unduly lenient sentence scheme and the review by the law commission but if he write to i with the specific of that case i will make sure that we look into it 
 as of   may   this year there be biological male in hmp downview a woman ’s prison in my constituency can the secretary of state confirm when they will be move out 
 the hon lady will be aware that those biological male be on e wing which be a transgend only facility we will review the recent supreme court ruling and make sure that we be compliant in everything we do go forward we have inherit a policy that we support in opposition it be a strong act by the last government but we will build on that follow the supreme court ’s recent ruling 
 a recent freedom of information request show that between january and march prison staff be recommend for dismissal due to breach of security however time that number resign over similar breach what action have the minister take to strengthen training oversight and accountability across the prison service to address this worrying trend and prevent further security failure 
 prison officer do an amazingly positive job in our prison occasionally prison officer let themselves down and those case be properly look at we continue to keep a tight look and we learn from any issue that occur 
 be the justice secretary content that her department spend more than half a pound every year lock up criminal who belong in other country

 i thank the right hon member for his question and i thank the civil justice council for its work he will understand that we have not yet have a chance to fully digest the report but we anticipate act on its recommendation in fairly short order 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 lord ponsonby tell the justice committee in february that the government will set out a public position on reform of wedding law include humanist marriage in the next few month the minister have say much the same today but when will it happen and will it include reform of current cohabitation law which disadvantage million of couple

 yesterday a man be convict of a public order offence after burn a   koran outside the turkish embassy the judge say that the fact that the man be attack be proof that he be guilty of disorderly behaviour this be grotesque and mean that in effect we have a blasphemy law do the justice secretary believe that this should hold or will the government back my bill to put an end to all of this madness next week 
 we do not have a blasphemy law and we be not go to have a blasphemy law in this country as the hon gentleman will be aware i believe that that specific case be go to be subject to an appeal so it would be inappropriate for i or any other minister to comment on the detail of the matter however i be sure that once all other channel be exhausted and we have a final resolution we will be debate these matter in detail in this house 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will make a statement on thames water ’s financial situation 
 i thank the right hon lady for secure this urgent question i want to begin by make clear that thames water remain stable and the government be carefully monitor the situation customer can be assure that there will be no disruption to water supply 
 thames water be a commercial entity currently engage in an equity raise and kkr pull out of that process early today as thames water have say the company will continue to work with its creditor as part of the equity raise to improve its financial position there remain a market lead solution on the table and we expect the company and its director to continue the process that be under way and fix the financial resilience of the company in the interest of its customer i want to be clear that the government be prepare for all eventuality across our regulated industry and stand ready to intervene through the use of a special administration regime should this be require to ensure the continue provision of vital public service 
 the situation face thames be take place within a wide context only last year we see record level of pollution in our river lake and sea it be clear that our water system be break we have already pass legislation so that the regulator can ban the undeserved multimillion pound bonus that so outrage the public and we have far strengthen accountability through the introduction of up to year in prison for pollute water boss who break the law we have increase the regulator ’s resource and launch a record criminal investigation into water company and we have follow the polluter pay principle mean that company that be successfully prosecute will pay for the cost of that prosecution so that further prosecution can follow we have work with the water company to secure £ of private sector investment to rebuild our broken water infrastructure that mean new sewage pipe few leaking pipe and new reservoir across the country as we work to end the sewage scandal that we inherit from the previous government 
 i launch the independent water commission under sir jon cunliffe so that it could outline recommendation for a once in a generation opportunity to transform our water industry and ensure that it deliver the service that the public deserve and our environment need and today sir jon publish an interim report set out the commission ’s preliminary conclusion the government will respond in full to the commission ’s final report in due course and will outline further step to benefit customer attract investment and clean up our waterway 
 whether we be talk about thames water or about other company serve other part of the country the era of profit from pollution be over this government will clean up our waterway for good 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question may i begin by correct the secretary of state when he refer to private sector investment he be in fact refer to the bill increase that each and every of we will pay—£31 a year so when he talk about private sector investment he mean bill payer investment 
 some resident and bill payer will have be concern by this morning ’s news that the private equity firm kkr have pull out of its rescue deal with thames water accord to a source close to kkr of the reason it pull out be its concern about negative rhetoric direct at thames water and the rest of the industry in recent week by the secretary of state and other ministers in other word the secretary of state and his ministers have talk themselves out of this rescue deal i be bind to say if only they could do the same thing with the chagos island deal 
 on which date do the secretary of state discover that kkr be think of pull out of this deal and what involvement do he have in the phone call over the weekend between kkr and no spad to try to rescue it i ask because in recent week there have be briefing to the press that he be consider temporary renationalisation the treasury have apparently instruct he that he will need to find up to £ from the budget of the department for environment food and rural affairs to cover the cost of this manoeuvre let i put that in context the entire farming budget for this year be roughly £ 
 can the secretary of state therefore explain the option to which he have just refer and do they include a plan for temporary renationalisation from which budget would a temporary renationalisation come defra or central fund that question be particularly relevant in view of the upcoming spending review on which there have be detail briefing include the suggestion that the defra budget be to be slash 
 the secretary of state refer to the cunliffe report which we will of course look at very carefully but can he confirm this recall yesterday ’s shambolic defence review announcement that there be no funding for this late review and that it will do nothing to resolve the immediate issue of thames water ’s solvency which he have mishandle just as he have mishandle the family farm tax the fishing industry and the sustainable farming incentive 
 i be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for make it clear to the house that she do not understand the principle of private sector investment and neither be it particularly clever to stand at the opposition dispatch box and make up figure to   attack 
 this government stand ready for all eventuality but i will make no apology for tackle the poor behaviour of water company and water company executive that take place under the previous government and that we be correct we even hear story which have be confirm to i by water company of previous conservative secretaries of state shout and scream at water company boss but not actually change the law to do anything about the bonus that they be able to pay themselves this government be take action work with customer water company and investor to ensure that we have a successful water   sector that work for the environment customer and investor in a way that it completely fail to do under the previous conservative government 
 let i begin by draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 let we be clear that the collapse of kkr ’s rescue deal be not a blip it be a reckoning a moment that expose the complete bankruptcy of the privatised water model this morning ’s interim cunliffe review of the water sector confirm the scale of the crisis it describe our water system a regulated statutory monopoly as be too risky for investor now it do not seem to be too risky when shareholder be siphon off billion in dividend while let the pipe rot the river choke and the debt pile up the only people truly at risk now be bill payer who face a real term price hike in the next year and not just to fund clean water or climate resilience because half of it be to boost investor return so i ask my right hon friend again when will the government stop fiddle put thames water into special administration strip out the debt and begin the job of return our water system not just thames water to public ownership 
 order mr lewis i be very generous in bring you in so early but i do not expect you to make a statement yourself 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i reassure he that the government stand ready for any eventuality and will take action as require we be not look at nationalisation because it would cost over £ of public money which would have to be take away from other public service such as the national health service to be give to the owner of the water company it would take year to unpick the current model of ownership during which time pollution would get bad we know that nationalisation be not the answer because we need only look at the situation in scotland to see that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 under the conservatives thames water be allow to pile up nearly £ of debt while pump sewage into river and lake for hour just last year but reward its shareholder with £ of dividend today thames water ’s customer have be leave in the lurch and the conservatives seem to think it be because we have all be a bit too mean about thames water 
 the price must not be pay by the customer will the secretary of state ensure that those who be responsible for make dreadful decision rightly bear the cost instead be it not right for the company now to go into special administration and to emerge from administration as a public interest company be it not also right that all water company include the like of united utilities in the north west move to a public interest model so that care for the environment matter more than profit 
 my hon friend   the member for witney charlie maynard   have do more to hold thames water to account than ofwat this government or their predecessor do that not prove that regulation have fail and that    ofwat should be abolish with a new powerful clean water authority give the power to clean up our lake and river and our industry 
 i thank the hon member for his question there be a procedure to be follow for special administration and we stand ready should that be require in this case or any other case involve the regulated industry he may have have a chance today to look at the interim report on which sir jon cunliffe be invite comment ahead of the final report in about a month that report will form the basis of future legislation to fix the regulatory mess we inherit from the conservative party 
 only the conservatives could come here and defend thames water the rest of the country have see what an appalling performance this company have give during the year since privatisation i think it be time we put this company out of its misery but we must do so in a way that do not bring the debt it have run up on to the taxpayer or the bill payer can my right hon friend say whether of his option be prepare for that eventuality 
 i thank my hon friend for his question we be prepare for every eventuality as i have outline and we will take whatever action be necessary to ensure the continue supply of water to customer in the thames water region and elsewhere 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 under the £ loan that thames water have negotiate the drawdown of £ will be on   june which be less than week away that be contingent on thames water have a lock up agreement in respect of a recapitalisation transaction but it now have no partner to provide that it of course choose to proceed with just option which have now walk away who do the secretary of state think that thames water will now turn to it be not exactly go to be negotiate from a position of strength and what be the government go to do if it can not meet that   june   deadline 
 there remain a market lead solution on the table and we expect thames water to follow through with the process to ensure it be able to fix the problem it be currently face 
 my constituent and other thames water user be feed up to the back tooth with have to pay more to help this company which have fail they so badly obviously the secretary of state have to have special administration on the table but we know that would be hugely costly to the taxpayer i know it be hard to talk about hypothetical but if he do go down that route will he have the cost to individual customer front and centre so they do not actually have to pay more for that process 
 yes i absolutely agree with my hon friend i share her anger at the fact that bill rise be so high this year but that be because the conservative party do not take the necessary action to ensure that the water system be properly maintain as anyone   who have ever own or live in a house will know if people see a crack in a wall and leave it for year without fix it the problem get much bad and the cost of repair it be much more in a very real sense the public have be leave to pay the price of tory failure 
 will the secretary of state confirm that the government will ensure that thames water stand by its commitment to upgrade our sewage network in south buckinghamshire specifically will he ensure that the upgrade promise for the little marlow sewage treatment work in my constituency be deliver on time 
 i be happy to give the hon member that reassurance the government expect thames water to carry through on the full range of programme agree as part of the last price review process 
 my constituent have be comprehensively fail by thames water for many year we see the catastrophic flood in herne hill in when many local business have to close permanently vulnerable customer be let down during the beast from the east freeze thaw event be leave without water for day and day at a time there be endless roadwork in the same location where it have repeatedly fail to invest adequately in its infrastructure now my constituent be see bill go up by way more than the ofwat determination it be clear that this organisation be not fit for purpose what option be my right hon friend consider to bring this misery to an end and to put customer back at the heart of thames water ’s operation 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be sure that she will have see today the interim report from sir jon cunliffe ’s water commission which outline his initial thought on how to fix the break regulatory system the government have also increase compensation from what we inherit from the previous government so her constituent who suffer from the kind of problem she outline can expect far well compensation as a result of this government ’s action 
 i declare an interest as a thames water customer the reality be that thames water be bankrupt it can not pay its debt and it can not meet its legal obligation to ofwat the state and its customer therefore surely the right thing to do be to put it out of its misery and put it into special administration for £ the shareholder and the debt holder know caveat emptor that they have all blow their dough if the government buy it for £ which would be a good deal for the taxpayer it will not have to pay huge egregious rate of interest and taxpayer and customer will be the beneficiary 
 i respectfully point out to the hon gentleman that reform care so much about the problem face our water system that it do not mention it even once in its general election manifesto what he be propose nationalise the water sector would cost in excess of £ which be money that reform would have to take away from the service such as the national health   service on which his constituent rely i think they would be very ill serve by he if he be to take away that funding and push up the waiting list we have just start to see come down as a result of this government ’s investment 
 as a neighbouring mp the secretary of state will know the level of outrage in my constituency at the continuous failure of thames water include the day period early this year during which resident be leave without water give that this labour government have introduce measure to make pollute water company executive criminally liable and to ban unjustified bonus do he agree that we be finally see accountability bring back to the water sector 
 i thank my hon friend and indeed neighbour for his question and i know what a strong water champion he be on behalf of his constituent his constituent much like everybody else ’s will now benefit from increase compensation when there be failure i agree with he that of the problem we inherit from the previous government be have a fail system with no accountability at all so it be quite right that we have introduce new criminal liability and potentially prison time for pollute water boss and that we have give the regulator the power to ban the unfair and undeserved multimillion pound bonus they get away with under the conservatives 
 do the secretary of state agree with thames water ’s own expert adviser teneo on page of the expert advice report that the ultimate cost to the government if the company go into special administration will be 
 the point be that there be a market lead solution on the table and i expect thames water to follow through on that 
 it be possible for an american private equity company to walk away from thames water but my constituent can not when water company boss fail it be our resident who pay in sewage discharge into river and in their crumble pipe and drainage i be therefore glad that the government have take bonus off of fail boss but what more can the government do to tilt incentive towards investment in our infrastructure so that my constituent get some relief 
 the problem that my hon friend point to are to do with a lack of investment throughout the entire period of the previous government so i be delighted that just before christmas we secure a commitment to £ of private sector investment that be the single big investment in our water sector in its entire history and will be the big private sector investment into any part of the economy under this government we be serious about clear up the conservative sewage mess 
 thames waters be a massive stakeholder in my constituency and the big landowner we have half of london ’s drinking water in raise reservoir and we have a fair chunk of the thames from staines to sunbury for month now i have be try to get a meeting with thames water   i appreciate that it have have or other thing on its mind recently but can the secretary of state use his good office to encourage thames water to meet i 
 i agree with the hon gentleman the water company thames water and all the other should of course engage with mp who be seek to represent the interest of their constituent i would be very happy to approach thames water on his behalf to ensure that he get the meeting he seek 
 my constituent like those of my colleague be gravely concerned about the increase in their water bill but i be also as concerned as they about the impact on business crayford town centre be close again last month the year on the trot because of rot infrastructure what assurance can the secretary of state give to my constituent that no matter what happen we will continue to invest in infrastructure to ensure that those kind of closure finally end 
 my hon friend will be aware of the action we have take through the water special measures act to give the regulator the power it need to ban the unjustified bonus that water boss be able to pay themselves under the previous government the era where they could profit from pollution end when that government end 
 the green party have campaign for the public ownership of water since the year dot unlike certain cynical opportunist behind i on the reform benches we know allow privatised monopoly to control water leave infrastructure crumbling waterway run with sewage sky high bill and shareholder laugh all the way to the bank give this obscene and fundamental failure why will the government not even consider bring water back into public hand where it belong 
 the problem face the water sector be to do with failure of governance and regulation we need to tackle the actual problem not the imagine one if we be to seek to nationalise the water sector that would cost in excess of £ that would have to be take away from service such as the national health service or education it would take year to unpick the current model of ownership during which time there would be no investment and water pollution would get bad from the example of scotland we know that nationalisation be not the answer because there be also problem with pollution there we will ensure that our priority be pure water not the purity of the hon lady ’s ideology 
 as thames water dump sewage into the cut and the blackwater in my constituency the conservative government wash their hand not in it but of it this government be act to ban bonus to issue the big fine we have see from ofwat and to bring in criminal liability as we seek more action to get to grip with the thames water crisis will the secretary of state commit to put thing at the forefront of his mind our   environment and clean the sewage and secondly make sure that customer and our constituent get a fair deal 
 i be sure my hon friend will be pleased to know that we have launch criminal investigation into water company for pollution and other failing a dramatic increase on what we inherit from the previous government i be sure he will recall that they cut the resource to the regulator in half despite the appalling financial inheritance we increase resource by at the budget and we have now introduce the polluter pay principle so that where there be a successful prosecution of a water company that company will pay the price of the investigation so that further investigation and prosecution can follow 
 thames water be teeter on the brink investor be run for the hill and my constituent be pay the price for its mismanagement through soar bill all the while it be spend hundred of million of pound on a propose sewage recycling project at teddington lock on the river thames in my constituency which will at well be use every year and which some cynic suggest be design entirely to boost its balance sheet this morning the secretary of state commit to my constituent ian mcnuff that he would come and visit the site to look at the impact of the propose project will he reiterate that commitment today my hon friend and neighbour   the member for richmond park sarah olney   and i would be delighted to welcome he 
 as i say to the hon lady ’s constituent i would be happy to visit if my diary allow in any case i would be very happy to ensure she get a meeting with the minister for water to discuss her concern around teddington 
 do the secretary of state agree that it come to something when the opposition seem to be suggest that thames water should maybe not be sanction because that may put its preferred bidder at risk when it have reject other jon cunliffe suggest strong regulation not weak be it not clear that the direction that this government be go in must be the right 
 i agree the whole mess we inherit be due to the previous government let the water company get away with it people be pay themselves multimillion pound bonus as they profit from pollution that end when the conservative government be defeat we be put the water company under tough special measure and we will focus they on serve their customer and the environment not themselves 
 do the secretary of state think that the situation might improve if thames water executive be oblige to sign up to performance relate pay 
 that be a very interesting proposal i hope the right hon gentleman will suggest it to sir jon cunliffe who be currently look at a well way to regulate 
 i note the secretary of state ’s reluctance to entertain public ownership but i draw his attention to research from the university of greenwich that show that bring water into public ownership would pay for itself within about year and that after that it would save the public purse up to £ a year be the secretary of state aware that immediately bring thames water into special administration and permanent public ownership would cut the company ’s massive debt mountain in half stop the payment of huge dividend and debt payment into the future and within just several year actually start turn a profit for the people of this country 
 i beg to slightly correct my hon friend special administration be not nationalisation and nationalisation would cost in excess of £ money we would have to take away from other public service to hand to the boss of the water company who cause this mess in the place i do not think taxpayer would welcome that 
 i receive a note in my inbox today from the government engagement lead for north thames valley that say that thames water will run out of money in summer will the government commit to take thames water into special administration and unburden the company of its debt via its creditor or will members be require to block their diary for summer for another recess recall 
 as i be sure the hon gentleman be aware there be procedure to follow that would require any regulated company to go into special administration as thing stand thames water remain stable and there be a market lead solution on the table we expect thames water to follow through on that 
 this be another example of the previous government ’s failure to get a grip of our water system meanwhile just last week this government fin yorkshire water £ my constituent be really upset to see their water bill go up can my right hon friend assure i that he will never let our national infrastructure get as bad as those on the conservative benches do 
 absolutely we intend to clear up the mess the previous government make the fine that my hon friend refer to indeed there have be other be the result of the additional criminal investigation we have launch which follow on from the additional resource we have give the regulator so that it can investigate what be go wrong and then take action what a difference between this labour government who be put our water company under special measure and the previous government who let they get away with it and line their pocket 
 i find it deeply depressing to hear the secretary of state say that somehow or other there be a market solution there for thames water we have have year of excessive profit pollution and rise bill he know he will have to take thames water into public ownership at some point he quote this strange figure of £ in compensation but surely if we take it into public ownership parliament would set the price at which we would purchase the   company take into account excessive profit pollution damage and the destruction of so many people ’s live through the way thames water have behave will the secretary of state be tough with it for once and say that water be a human right and that it should be publicly own and publicly run 
 water be indeed a human right which be why this government be take every step necessary to sort out the broken water system that we inherit from the previous government 
 the situation at thames water be deeply disturbing and in my constituency of camborne redruth and hayle the home of surfers against sewage there be now deep anxiety that this commercial insecurity will spread with only prosecution and no meaningful penalty under the previous government be it not clear that the conservatives prioritise the polluter instead of protect the environment and customer
