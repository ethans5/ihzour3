 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to the mineworker pension scheme on the living standard of recipient 
 in the budget the government decide to transfer the mineworker pension scheme investment reserve to member of the scheme at the end of last month the increase in payment be make to over ex miner and their family that have mean an extra rise in people ’s pension each month an average of £ per week the overturning of that historic injustice demonstrate the difference make by a labour government 
 i thank the secretary of state for that reply and for his attentive engagement on the issue i understand that british coal staff superannuation scheme trustee write to the department last month with reform proposal i urge the secretary of state to   meet they as soon as possible to rectify the long stand injustice especially give the increase age and decline health of the beneficiary 
 i should say that the praise all go to the minister for industry my hon friend   the member for croydon west sarah jones for the progress that have be make she be in sole charge of the issue i know that she have be engage with the trustee of the bcsss indeed i believe she meet they yesterday she know the point my hon friend   the member for kilmarnock and loudoun lillian jones   be make about that scheme 
 in blaenau gwent and rhymney miner receive the big number of increase payment from the mineworker pension scheme in wales all of my uncle on my mum ’s side be miner dessie winter who be alive and well will benefit from the mps change but my uncle georgie and jackie be pit supervisor who pay into the separate national coal board staff pension scheme they have sadly pass but their colleague deserve fairness since the government have receive £ from the bcsss will the secretary of state say if he will look again at the staff side ’s surplus payment to benefit our pensioner 
 my hon friend make his point with customary eloquence i know from personal experience that there be people who be wait for the injustice to be remedie but unfortunately die before that happen he refer to part of the issue raise by the business energy and industrial strategy committee as it then be about 50:50 surplus sharing i know my hon friend the minister for industry be look at that 
 correct the injustice in the mineworker pension scheme have make an incredible difference to the former miner in my constituency of dunfermline and dollar after so many year at the weekend i meet representative from the bcsss in fife include the man and woman who be particularly affect by that scheme and the woman who work in the canteen and other area who feel that they have be leave behind by the change to the mps will the secretary of state meet campaigner in fife and across scotland regard this issue and will he ensure that he make progress as quickly as possible to correct the injustice that those people have suffer as well 
 i know from my constituency that there be a strong feeling about the bcsss that be why my hon friend the minister for industry have move at speed to meet the trustee the scheme be not exactly the same in some of their arrangement but my hon friend   the member for dunfermline and graeme downie   be right to say that there be certainly a read across from some of the injustice in the mps and i know that the minister for industry be look at that 
 as a collier i welcome the government ’s announcement on the mineworker pension scheme however as the secretary of state have hear the bcsss member include my constituent mitch wainwright have raise concern about unequal treatment give the similarity between the scheme what step be the    secretary of state and the minister take to ensure that those former british coal employee be treat as equitably as those in the mps 
 my hon friend be right about the read across and the sense that the injustice that have be remedie in the mps need to be remedie in the bcsss there be also a real need for speed that be why my hon friend the minister for industry be on the case as she be so brilliantly on the mps deliver in less than month the justice that the conservative government never deliver in year 
 in my constituency of makerfield more than people stand to benefit from change introduce by this government to the mineworker pension scheme for year those people and their family stand by and watch as the conservative government steal their pension and disrespect their work i want we to celebrate our industrial past and those who make this nation wealthy and power our industrial revolution do the secretary of state agree that we need to do more to remember the legacy of mining as well as to drive up the living standard of those on the mineworker pension scheme 
 my hon friend be right i think i be right in say my hon friend the minister for industry and i have have a discussion about this that almost every constituency 
 it be every constituency 
 every constituency have member of the mps who be benefit from this i hope the conservative party welcome a labour government act on this injustice there be not much sign of that though my hon friend   the member for makerfield josh simons   make the point about commemorate the work of miner which be something that i feel strongly about and that we will pursue 
 i be sure that any of my constituent who stand to benefit from this increase will welcome it but how many member of the mineworker pension scheme will be lose out on winter fuel payment worth up to £ due to the decision that this government have take 
 this be actually to do with the disastrous economic legacy that be leave by the conservative party the truth be that even in tough time the labour government be show with their decision on the mps how we can make our society more just 
 of the question i be most frequently ask when i be the trustee of of the large local authority pension scheme be what more the fund could do to tackle climate change particularly in relation to investing in fossil fuel company will the secretary of state update the house on the conversation that he have be have with the pensions minister to ensure that pension fund do their bit to help get we to net 
 that be an excellent question mr speaker i will write to the hon lady with a good answer 
 i be pleased to see the secretary of state say last week that those who host clean energy infrastructure should benefit from it when landowner and developer in my constituency be cash in on build new solar my constituent in bicester and woodstock think that it be only fair that benefit be share will the secretary of state tell i whether he will follow the model of other government in set a mandatory 
 order let we try somebody else 
 i should declare an interest in that many of my relative across south wales be former miner in the autumn budget the government quite rightly make the decision to end the pension injustice for miner who be part of the mineworker pension scheme but they do not do the same for the miner who be part of the british coal staff superannuation scheme include former miner in my own constituency will the government guarantee that these man and woman get the pension they deserve and explain why they will have to wait long for justice than many of their former colleague 
 the hon member and i both have constituency interest in this matter and he be right to say that none the less i say gently to he that no action be take on this for a very very long time indeed since privatisation this government take action in the budget in less than month that be the difference i have make it absolutely clear that my hon friend the minister for industry be now turn her excellent attention to the bcsss 
 rise 
 i be not sure whether there be many coalmine in strangford but come on then i call jim shannon 
 may i welcome what the government and the minister be do on this matter this good scheme take care of an injustice from some year ago there be those in northern ireland who work in the mine and their family be still concerned about this issue can we have a timescale for the completion of the work on the british coal staff superannuation scheme which some of they would have qualify for 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i be glad that he too like everyone else in this house accord to my hon friend the minister for industry have constituent who will be benefit from this work the good i can say to he on this issue which have now be rightly raise a number of time be that the minister for industry will have hear the call make with real urgency which i think we all recognise and will act accordingly 
 what step he be take to support community energy project 
 community energy will play a pivotal role in our mission for clean power last week we publish the clean power action plan which contain more information about how we will meet this world lead mission and the report confirm that community energy will play an important role particularly through great british energy 
 renewable energy scheme on community building in my oxfordshire constituency of didcot and wantage support by the low carbon hub in oxford have mostly benefit building owner up to now would the minister support more flexibility in local energy system and allow local energy trading to get more support for renewable energy scheme in our community so that more local people can directly benefit 
 the hon gentleman make an incredibly important point about how local community group can benefit from not just host the community energy but from be able to sell locally we have have a number of conversation on this topic already i most recently meet the community energy contact group which do a lot of work to look at what regulation there might be and we be happy to look at any proposal that come forward we want to see a revolution in community energy right across the country so that more community can benefit 
 under the previous government we have an energy market that work for nobody it be bad for consumer and we also see many energy company go out of business as the government lose any grip on the industry do my hon friend agree that with the great stability we have under this new labour government there be opportunity for community energy come forward as part of the recovery of our whole energy infrastructure 
 it will not surprise the house that i agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend who as always make an incredibly important point he be right that stability be key but so too be this government ’s commitment to invest in community energy we have commit to upwards of gw of energy from community source over the course of this parliament up to that commitment ensure not just that we have an energy mix where community benefit but that they benefit from the economic and social advantage of own the energy they produce 
 community energy scheme provide a great opportunity for local community to take ownership of clean energy production in glastonbury and somerton we have see the benefit as avalon community energy project around glastonbury be project to save tonne of carbon per year how will the minister support community energy scheme and ensure that they play a fair and full role in create clean energy 
 the hon member have raise community energy on a number of occasion in this place and i know she be a champion of it she be right to highlight the example of where community energy can make a huge difference of the key area we want to   drive forward be the local power plan which will be deliver by great british energy unfortunately her party do not in the end support the creation of great british energy but i hope they will change that position and see the huge advantage of invest through great british energy in scheme like the she mention but also of help to build capacity in community group so that they be capable of drive those project forward 
 i declare the interest that i be a unite the union member 
 community all across scotland rely on the grangemouth refinery for their energy as closure loom unite have give the government a plan that will save job help hit sustainable aviation fuel target and build new green industry for the future it be not too late to save those job and achieve the just transition that my community desperately need will the secretary of state agree that the plan have great potential and agree to meet unite to see what the government can do to achieve a truly just transition for the refinery worker and keep scotland ’s only refinery work 
 as my hon friend know we have meet unite on a number of occasion over the past few month since petroineos make the disappointing decision to follow through on its closure plan for the grangemouth refinery it be important that we look at every possible option and we have do 
 it be also important that the government be clear that we want to see a long term sustainable future for the refinery site that be why we invest in project willow which at the moment be come up with credible investable proposition for the site we want to protect the worker and do whatever we can to ensure a just transition at grangemouth and for industry right across the country but those option need to be long term and sustainable so that we do not drive worker back into this process again a few year down the line we be committed to ensure that we invest in long term sustainable proposition for the site and of course we will meet anyone and discuss any proposition to help make that happen 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be so good to hear the minister affirm the need to bring the public onside as well as private sector investment to achieve the transformation towards green power and net the liberal democrats support great british energy if community energy be at the centre of the great british energy bill our colleague in the lords be debate amendment relate to direct participation in and benefit from community energy will the minister agree to those proposal if they come to this house 
 in the spirit of christmas i thank the hon lady for all the engagement and discussion we have had—[interruption the conservative front benchers groan but i have joy for their party at christmas as well we be absolutely committed to community energy which be in our manifesto at every stage of the bill we have commit to community energy be   right at the heart of what great british energy will do if their lordship make any amendment in their consideration of the bill we will of course consider those amendment when the bill come back to this place however i say gently to the hon lady that her party do not support great british energy so it can not now claim credit for the thing that great british energy will deliver 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of establish a community benefit scheme for household near new energy infrastructure 
 we have make clear through the clean power action plan that we announce last week that where community host clean energy infrastructure we will ensure that they benefit from it there be many option in that area include community fund and direct support for household and we be explore all those option to ensure that community can benefit from the clean power mission 
 there be a proposal to build wind turbine on protect peatland in the neighbour calderdale council area which i be staunchly against to make matter bad if the development be approve my constituent will not benefit from any community benefit scheme despite be on the periphery of the propose location how will the secretary of state ensure that my constituent get their fair share of any community benefit scheme should the proposal be approve 
 i can not comment on the specific detail of the case however i would like to know more about why the hon gentleman ’s community might not benefit because the aim be for all community affect by host infrastructure to benefit in different way we be look at the option be they money off bill or the community benefit fund that exist at the moment as we work through the answer to the consultation launch by the previous government however we be clear that if community host infrastructure that be nationally important and benefit the whole country they should benefit from do so 
 community benefit come in many different form in my constituency ørsted have contribute £ towards horizon youth zone and rwe be support projekt renewable which be a box park learning zone but the most wide reach benefit be to people ’s pocket scheme such as the octopus fan club bring down people ’s bill when the use of renewable be at its high how can other energy retailer deliver similar saving for consumer 
 my hon friend ask an extremely important question all community should benefit from the transformation that we want to make to the energy system part of the answer be improve how we use smart system right across the energy system so that people have much more consumer lead flexibility in   their option we be move forward with that in the clean power action plan that we publish last week we commit to do much more to give people the power to take advantage of some of the opportunity she mention 
 i call the shadow minister 
 community engagement and funding be important with large scale solar farm plan for agricultural land do the secretary of state think that there be any circumstance in which local community might know well than he 
 community be and will always be able to speak about the plan for their local area and to contribute to consultation and planning application we will not change anything about that however it be important to say that nationally important infrastructure will need to be build somewhere if we be to have the clean power future and energy security that everybody in this country need i gently say to the hon lady that even in the most extreme statistic less than of land in this country would be use to build for solar either the conservatives be in favour of keep we on the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel or they be in favour of build clean power her party use to be in favour of net but now it seem to be run away from it at speed 
 what step he be take to introduce a warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce a warm home plan 
 we be get on with deliver our warm home plan we be set to upgrade up to home next year we be introduce new standard in the private rent sector and the social rent sector that will lift people out of fuel poverty and we be make it easy for people to install heat pump by remove planning restriction expand our boiler upgrade scheme so that more people can get a discount and boost the heat pump industry 
 modelling suggest that in resident in north west leicestershire be in fuel poverty do the minister understand the frustration many constituent will feel that despite be in of the wealthy country in the world fuel poverty have become so commonplace will she write to i with an outline of the element in the warm home plan that will focus on delivery for those in fuel poverty 
 i share the frustration of my hon friend ’s constituent the scale of fuel poverty in this country be a shameful legacy of the last government ’s year of failure it be a legacy that we be determined to turn around through our warm home plan and our winter support package and we will do everything we can to make sure that cold draughty home be a thing of the past 
 the last government leave we far too reliant on foreign dictator for our energy need i congratulate this government on their focus on end that dependence and make we energy independent what step be my hon friend take to reduce bill for resident in my constituency and to far ensure that britain remain genuinely energy independent 
 my hon friend be completely right too many people can not afford their energy bills—[interruption that be your legacy that be why we be run to deliver clean energy by and roll out our warm home plan so that we can upgrade million of home to make they warm and cheap to run 
 but it be not my legacy do not worry 
 the secretary of state the minister for energy and the minister for consumers have all say in this house that the national energy system operator ’s report show that the government ’s target will lower energy bill however the report itself explicitly say that it do not do so and the chief executive officer of the neso tell the energy security and net select committee last week that it do not set out to determine what bill be for consumer will the minister explain those inconsistency and take the opportunity to correct the record 
 i suggest that the hon lady actually read the report on page the neso set out in black and white the system cost of a clean power system and then what it call 
 bill component result from clean power pathway 
 and other bill change the total impact in be to reduce electricity cost by £ per megawatt hour of course as the neso say it be for the government to make the policy choice to reduce energy bill which we will but it be absolutely clear that our clean power plan will reduce system cost 
 citizens advice have find that more than a of private tenant could not afford to heat their house to a comfortable temperature last winter and in research publish a month ago it find that of private landlord have no plan to invest in the energy efficiency of their property in the next year can the minister explain what the government will do to support and incentivise private landlord to drive up minimum energy efficiency standard in their property and when they will do it so that tenant can stay warm all year round 
 we know that the quality of too many of our home in the private rent sector be not high enough that be why we be move forward to introduce minimum energy efficiency standard so that we can raise those standard lift people out of fuel poverty we be run in order to get that do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 after the conservative government ’s failure to tackle insulation fuel poverty be on the rise in my constituency almost of household with young family member those   between and year be fuel poor live in cold damp house and choose between eating and heating while we await the warm home plan that will deal with upgrade current housing stock will the minister meet the minister for housing and planning to ensure that all future home will come forward with an energy rating that be a minimum of c or high but not beyond for the future home standard 
 we be work very closely with housing communities and local government ministers to deal with the future home standard we recognise that the fact we be build home that be not up to the standard be a problem and we be get on with fix it 
 what step he be take to improve energy security 
 what step he be take to improve energy security 
 last friday we publish our landmark clean power action plan which set out the route towards our world lead clean power mission include wholesale reform of the grid and plan to make it happen this be the route to get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel market and deliver energy security low bill and good job for the british people as well as tackle the climate crisis 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer give wales ’s tradition and history of fuel the uk ’s energy need can the secretary of state tell we what his plan be to put wales at the heart of our energy security and net agenda 
 my hon friend ask a really important question the whole clean power plan be about benefit all nation of the united kingdom include wales and we work closely with the welsh government on these issue before this labour government come to office they be actually trailblazer on how we could have publicly own generation and that be of the thing that we and gb energy be work with they on 
 meur ras ha myttin da mr speaker we have see the terrible consequence for household of fossil fuel energy insecurity and we can not allow this to happen with the transition to renewable however to achieve our net goal we will have to see a massive increase in demand for critical mineral such as tin and lithium much of the supply and processing of which will be dominate by economically bad actor will the minister meet i to discuss how the government will be mitigate this clear and present danger 
 i very much enjoy my trip to my hon friend ’s constituency before the general election he be an incredibly powerful advocate for the way his area can source some of the critical mineral we need include lithium and he be right about this the concentration of supply chain include critical mineral have take a generation to arrive but we must unwind it and it be of the many thing we be work on as a government 
 small modular reactor be less land intensive be very efficient and would get we to clean energy very quickly if the government be to get on and actually support some order as land be in scarce supply when will the government get on board with nuclear instead of shackle themselves to the inefficient land destroy countryside beauty destroy and inefficient solar 
 i can tell the hon gentleman that we support the smr programme and we be drive it forward through great british nuclear i be afraid he be make a terrible mistake which be that we need all of these clean technology at our disposal we need nuclear we need renewable we need carbon capture and storage and the difference be that this government be get on with it we have deliver more in month than the last government do in year 
 despite lift the onshore wind ban in england the clean power action plan show that by mw of onshore wind will be need in england and wales mw of which will be mainly in wales with bit in england can the secretary of state outline exactly how wales will be benefit from this huge ramp up in onshore wind rather than the benefit be extract out of wales 
 i have to say to the hon lady that i do not see it that way the reality be that the country be totally vulnerable to the rollercoaster of the fossil fuel market we do not need to look into a crystal ball we just need to look at the record we see the bad cost of live crisis in generation so long as we be expose in this way people in wales and across the country be vulnerable that be why clean power be so important and the opposition should get on and support it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in the clean power document publish last week the government state that they be 
 progress the post-2030 generation intervention with final decision on sizewell c and the great british nuclear lead small modular reactor programme 
 but no date be specify for the final investment decision on sizewell no date be specify for completion of the down selection smr process there be no indication of a route to market for advanced modular or other technology and there be no mention of wylfa at all so be it any wonder that the nuclear industry hold a suspicion that this government be not serious about nuclear that the damascene conversion to nuclear power profess by the secretary of state be a false and that for the government it be renewable at any cost and the exclusion of everything else 
 i find the hon gentleman quite extraordinary and not in a good way the last government leave not only a generalised absolute mess in the public finance but lot of the programme that he be talk about be not even fund the difference with this government and my right hon friend the chancellor be that she put the money for sizewell in the budget that be something the conservatives simply do not understand interruption you get the point 
 it be we in government who buy the wylfa and oldbury site from hitachi last year give much need certainty to the workforce and local community on both site it be on   may   that we announce that wylfa be our preferred location for a gigawatt scale reactor again give a boost to that community and the wide industry i have question be it still the government ’s intention to reach gw of nuclear power by do the secretary of state acknowledge that that be impossible without another gigawatt scale reactor if a gigawatt scale reaction be plan will it be build at wylfa and if not what be the future for the wylfa site 
 the hon gentleman ’s story about wylfa say it all he say his government have this great plan for wylfa but they have no money behind it 
 we buy the site 
 yes but the hon gentleman do not say how the power station will be fund the truth be that this be elementary economic if thing be announce they need to be able to be fund and the conservatives need to learn that lesson 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on potential opportunity for industry under the national wealth fund 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on potential opportunity for industry under the national wealth fund 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on potential opportunity for industry under the national wealth fund 
 the national wealth fund be deliver a key manifesto commitment to set up a government back investor in some way like the sovereign wealth fund we see in other country that will support the uk ’s industrial strategy and economic growth it will play a central role in our clean power mission by create job in rapidly grow green industry my role sit across the department for business and trade where i work on industrial strategy and this department where i work on industrial decarbonisation so i have a unique vantage point to see the benefit of the national wealth fund and all the opportunity it will bring 
 as the minister know i be concern about kick start float offshore wind in the celtic sea the infrastructure and supply chain need build out quickly but in a co ordinated way and the previous government ’s float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme be not enough to do that will the minister please confirm that she be work with the wealth fund on a strategy and then speedy investment in port such as falmouth and the local supply chain so that they be ready to take on the challenge of float offshore wind 
 my hon friend be a great champion for her area and we have talk about the opportunity of falmouth and the surround area previously and i be sure we will do so again for too long our coastal area have lack the job and opportunity they deserve and we be determined to change that through the national wealth fund we will invest in our port and great british energy will look to crowd in private sector funding to emerge technology such as float offshore wind we be develop our strategy and work as fast as we can 
 i welcome the government ’s publication of the clean power action plan last week it will mark a transformative shift towards clean energy that will bring good job and industry to the whole country the plan propose the use of the national wealth fund to explore nascent renewable generation project the minister will know of the potential for tidal range on the west coast what step be the department take to explore that potential will she meet i to discuss the potential for tidal range project in my constituency 
 i would love to hear more as i be sure would the minister for energy my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks we be committed to all form of renewable energy if they be economical which be why we ringfence tidal in the late contract for difference auction which result in tidal project be successful secure up to mw we continue to look at what more we can do to support this more nascent technology include the role that gb energy can play in the future 
 the government ’s quick action when they take office to commission project willow be welcome but confirmation of the decision by petroineo to close the grangemouth refinery next year have cause further concern and uncertainty throughout the workforce in the central belt with the sustainable aviation fuel mandate start in require of jet fuel to be saf by what consideration have the minister give to use the role of the national wealth fund to support the rapid conversion of grangemouth into a sustainable aviation fuel facility 
 i appreciate the uncertainty face by people in my hon friend ’s constituency we have project willow and the plan for the site ’s future a joint committee which i co chair have just be set up with the department for transport look at sustainable aviation fuel and other option to fund and support that to ensure that we have that emerge industry 
 the fund ’s title be the national wealth fund will the minister outline what she intend to do to ensure that industry across the nation of the united kingdom will benefit from it 
 the national wealth fund make decision on what it fund and what it do not but our plan be for the whole country for too long this country have be hold back in every corner and the national wealth fund be a really important part of the future growth of this country in northern ireland and everywhere else 
 do the minister agree that it be something of a tragedy that the uk which be surround by the high tidal range on planet earth after canada use so little of that for tidal and marine energy she may agree that the reason be that while the lifetime cost of such scheme be as cheap as chip the up front cost be expensive could the national wealth fund ensure that we can build thing for example in morecambe bay that will generate secure renewable energy for all our lifetime 
 the hon gentleman put his finger on the problem that be what vehicle such as the national wealth fund and gb energy be look to resolve we be of course open to it and we will do what we can 
 whether he have have discussion with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs on nature base solution to help tackle   climate   change 
 whether he be take step with cabinet colleague to support nature base solution to climate change 
 we know that nature base solution have a key role to play in climate mitigation and keep to ° c at home and abroad i have meet the minister for nature my hon friend   the member for coventry east mary creagh and the government have appoint special representative for climate and for nature who will be work closely together too 
 the climate and nature crisis be now recognise as inextricably interlink we can not resolve the climate crisis without address the nature crisis but that be not recognise in current legislation will the minister meet i to discuss my climate and nature bill and its potential to achieve the government ’s state goal of integrate uk climate and biodiversity policy 
 we be not convince that the bill be necessary as a well develop legislative framework with legally bind target be already in place include of course the climate change act and the carbon budget however i appreciate the action on both climate and nature and the hon member ’s commitment to both i believe that our office be already try to find a date for we to meet 
 my constituency of paisley and renfrewshire south be home to the beautiful rspb lochwinnoch nature reserve in addition to support our biodiversity the reserve serve as a natural carbon sink globally wetland hold approximately to of the earth ’s soil carbon despite cover only of the land surface will the minister outline how the department be integrate wetland and peatland restoration into its strategy for meet the uk ’s carbon capture and storage target 
 i be aware of the excellent work be carry out at lochwinnoch we know that protect and restore our peatland be essential for tackle the climate crisis we be commit to restore approximately hectare of peatland we be also look at innovative way of get fund into those nature base solution so that they can thrive 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community 
 great british energy will deliver well pay job in industrial community it will own and invest in project across the country it will crowd in private investment and it will develop those crucial supply chain that will make we more resilient as a country and deliver more job 
 i be delighted to see the government ’s commitment to reindustrialise our nation create thousand of job in the process this be the difference that a labour government can make clean up the mess of the tories and put this country back on track my constituency of airdrie and shotts be at the heart of scotland ’s central belt once an industrial heartland it be full of skill and potential wait to be unlocked will the minister work with i to ensure that the benefit of the significant job creation that the government be undertake will be feel in my constituency 
 i will work with my hon friend on create the job that we all want it have be announce that great british energy will be locate in aberdeen and there be additional site in glasgow and in edinburgh the national wealth fund have just announce a £ investment in xlcc to support a world lead factory in hunterston produce cable that will support job we have see a £ investment by sarens psg to provide specialist equipment and skilled worker and to set up a centre for excellence in aberdeen those be the kind of project that we want across our community in his constituency and beyond 
 an important aspect of great british energy ’s work will be ensure industrial strength in all area of the uk place such as peterborough be well place to develop high skilled job and great opportunity in green hydrogen to support that transition through the work of national gas in werrington and our new university campus anglia ruskin university peterborough do the minister agree that the success of gb energy will be the breadth of opportunity that it create in place such as mine 
 my hon friend be absolutely right green hydrogen be vital not just for the decarbonisation of heavy industry but for aviation and maritime it have the potential to create thousand of very highly skilled   job in every region of the country we have already confirm support for green hydrogen project from cumbria to cornwall and from scotland to kent i look forward to say more on our hydrogen journey soon 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the labour party promise job through great british energy but the secretary of state have endorse a carbon tax of £ in double the department ’s current forecast it would be the high carbon tax in the world and devastating for british industry can the hon lady confirm how many british job would be lose as a result 
 i do not recognise those figure at all i would be interested to see where she get they from perhaps from her twitter thread which contain thing that we do not quite recognise we inherit a mess in this country no stability or economic growth and stagnation we be fix the foundation and put that right we will create hundred of thousand of job in the grow green sector of the future 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 we be already see the benefit of our energy superpower mission and investment in job since the start of november we have see a £ investment in hull by siemens gamesa support job in blade manufacturing ørsted have announce £ of order for uk firm and we have reach financial close on the uk ’s carbon capture in teesside that be what it mean to have a government deliver job and investment for the british people 
 there appear to be inconsistency between what ministers be say about the report by the national energy system operator and what the ceo of neso tell the energy security and net committee last week can the secretary of state answer this clearly do the neso report forecast high or low energy bill under his policy 
 i be very glad that the hon gentleman have ask that question as the shadow secretary of state have ask i about that interruption i will answer the question page of the neso report say very clearly what happen to overall cost in the system electricity cost be reduce by £ per mwh as neso say it be for government to make policy choice that determine the precise impact on bill but the report be clear that the system will be cheap it be completely logical to say that that will lead to a reduction in bill 
 my constituency have the high number of member on the british coal staff superannuation scheme in the country we have more than member do the minister agree that we need   to end the injustice for all former employee on that scheme will she visit my beautiful constituency to meet i and member of the scheme 
 i would be very happy to meet my hon friend and member of the scheme i meet the trustee of the scheme yesterday and i have commit to talk to the treasury about their proposal 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 labour ’s policy on the north sea will cost the country £ in tax receipt which would be enough to cover the winter fuel payment for many many year pensioner will be in the cold this winter and this be a policy that no other major economy be pursue how can the government possibly justify it 
 these be more fantasy number from the right hon lady the truth be that the north sea have lose a of its employment in the past decade the only future for the north sea be in what this government be do invest in carbon capture and storage in offshore wind and in hydrogen that be the future 
 that be not my figure it be a figure from industry—£12 in lose north sea tax receipt in addition to £ for an energy company that will not generate energy and at least £ for a target that we now know will not cut bill be it not true that pensioner will be sit in the cold this winter to pick up the bill for this secretary of state 
 no the case be that the conservatives leave we dependent on fossil fuel which lead to the bad cost of live crisis in live memory the tragedy be that they be double down on their fail policy the only answer for low bill be clean home grow energy that we control 
 i welcome the clean power plan which the government publish last week which lay out the route to energy security and low bill will my right hon friend provide more detail on how our new national champion great british energy which be back by the overwhelming majority of the public in stevenage and elsewhere will form part of this new plan 
 my hon friend be absolutely right great british energy headquarter in aberdeen be already up and run our plan for great british energy will be roll out in the new year those plan include work with local community for solar on school and hospital so that we can start cut bill for public service and local community 
 my constituent be promise £ off their energy bill by the labour government instead they be have to fork out additional money for great british energy and to pursue net while the government take the winter fuel payment away from million of pensioner how can the secretary of state justify increase spending on net project while his government let pensioner go cold this winter 
 the truth be that there be only way to get bill down sustainably in this country which be to drive towards clean energy the conservatives use to believe that too then in september the former prime minister take they on an anti net crusade and it be only get bad 
 more than half the home in my constituency have an energy performance rating of d or bad and a quarter be off grid rely on more expensive fuel so i welcome this government ’s commitment to a warm home plan however with a lot of rural home poorly insulate and not suit to heat pump will the secretary of state work with i on a tailor plan for cold stone build rural home 
 we be roll out our warm home plan which we want every household to benefit from and we will ensure that we have the right solution for the right home i will work with my hon friend and with member from across the house on solution that every household can benefit from to ensure that we have warm home that be cheap to run 
 the spill of fuel oil in the black sea from russian tanker be yet another tragic reminder of the work that russia be do to subvert our sanction what be the secretary of state ’s assessment of the amount of petrochemical product and their derivative enter our economy from russia today 
 i will not answer the hon gentleman directly but i will say that i be work with my colleague across government on this crucial issue we will do everything we can to drive down russia ’s benefit from its oil and gas industry because that be a crucial part of the war effort to help ukraine 
 sky rocket energy bill under the previous conservative government contribute to the cost of living crisis and be of the reason that voter in my constituency choose change with labour at the general election will the secretary of state further outline what change this labour government will make to deliver well value to my constituent 
 my hon friend be right about this we must not have short memory here because the truth be that the cost of living crisis that we see after russia ’s invasion of ukraine not only hit family and business across britain but continue to hit they today that be why the drive for clean power be so important every solar panel we put up every wind turbine we erect and every piece of grid we build make we more secure as a country 
 the secretary of state will be well aware of the critical role that the carbon capture schemeat st fergus will play in the economic growth and potential of north east scotland so can he simply give we a timetable for when he will approve that scheme 
 we will look at the scheme in the spending review i believe that it be important not just to scotland but to the whole uk but i want to level with the hon gentleman and indeed the house it require significant financial resource we find the resource for track of carbon capture usage and storage and we want to find the resource for track but that as i have say will be part of the spending review 
 in the government ’s policy paper clean power action plan float offshore wind be label a key emerge technology and development be promise for future round of contract for difference will the minister please consider go far and geographically ringfence contract for difference funding to ensure that the massive potential of project such as float offshore wind in the celtic sea be unlocked 
 my hon friend be right to suggest that offshore wind especially float offshore wind will play a critical role in our pathway to clean power we will consider any option to ensure that we get many test and demonstrate project through to delivery and we will say more in come week about what the next round of contract for difference will look like 
 more than home in my constituency have an energy performance certificate banding of d or bad which mean tonne of avoidable carbon dioxide emission and high energy bill for my constituent however the rate of insulation upgrade be too slow for we to meet the government ’s goal of universal band c rating by will the minister commit herself with more urgency to an emergency home insulation programme with target support for those on low income 
 we recognise that not enough be do to upgrade home over the last year which be why we be absolutely run at this we will upgrade up to home this year and we be put in place our plan to drive up standard in the private rented sector and to ensure that as many household as possible benefit from home that be warm and much much cheap to run 
 in my constituency there have be strong growth in the purchase of electric vehicle but we have only half as many public charging point per person as the national average how can we secure more charging point in public space in rural community 
 my hon friend make an important point about roll out charge infrastructure to all part of the country and we be work on that with colleague in the department for transport local distribution network in rural area be incredibly important and introduce great access to the grid include through ofgem ’s approval of £ to improve distribution network will enable we to roll out ev infrastructure in rural area throughout the country 
 this weekend household in cleat hill be able to return home week after the gas explosion there that be thank to the effort of the local council and the local emergency service but not i be afraid to the action of the government there have be a deafen silence on whether they will help the council with funding and whether they will fund a scaling and scoping of the gas reservoir i be extremely grateful to the minister for meet i but will she chivvy her other ministers along so that we can get a reply 
 i thank the hon member for that meeting we be work across government to ensure that we can provide the support that the community require after that tragic incident 
 i recently visit the emission boiler manufacturer tepeo in wokingham its owner be thrill by the government ’s decision that heat battery can qualify for the warm home social housing fund wave but express concern about whether they could scale up without the same subsidy support and vat relief as heat pump will the minister meet i and representative of thermal storage uk to discuss how we can support heat battery so that household can become more resilient 
 my hon friend be a great champion of our clean power mission and i would be very happy to meet he and representative of the sector 
 per cent of voter think that all new home should come with solar panel on the roof as standard do the government agree 
 i be very sympathetic towards this issue and we be in discussion with our colleague across government watch this space 
 cheshire be lead the way in ccus whether it be in hydrogen production where it be provide the mean of transition as a new industry be establish or in hard to abate sector such as glass or cement production where ccus be a vital decarbonisation component our strategy be create job grow our skill base and unlock a low carbon future do the minister agree that it will not be possible to get to net without ccus 
 that be absolutely right 
 the grimsby to walpole national grid scheme will see pylon almost twice the height of the exist one be place across the flat landscape of the fen why do the secretary of state think that the cost of chase his unrealistic target should be disproportionately bear by rural community 
 i have great respect for the right hon gentleman the truth be that we need to build the grid regardless of whether the target be or this government be be honest and open with people in say that the grid need to be build if we do not build the grid we will remain massively vulnerable as a country 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 last year the uk import of our energy do the secretary of state agree that as well as protect bill payer from the volatility of international fossil fuel market and give we energy independence we have the potential for economic benefit from export electricity and hydrogen through the clean power plan 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about that it be about energy independence for britain and about become a clean energy superpower that can export energy and benefit as a country the opportunity be huge which be why we be get on with it 
 i think the secretary of state be now argue that energy bill will fall by £ by a simple question how much will they rise by before then 
 i be disappoint in the right hon gentleman but perhaps i should not be surprised the truth be that there be only future for britain that reduce bill for good a clean power mission we can carry on be vulnerable and we can carry on with fossil fuel but we will be in the grip of petrostate and dictator this government be not willing to leave we expose 
 the lynemouth biomass power station in my constituency have some very ambitious and exciting project involve carbon capture and storage but it be wait for some major decision by the department will the minister agree to meet i so that we can tackle these press outstanding issue 
 i would be absolutely delighted to meet my hon friend we can talk about data centre at the same time carbon capture be an incredibly important part of our future we know that we have to have it in order to decarbonise some of our very hard to decarbonise industry and i would be delighted to talk about the possible job that it could bring as well 
 local further education college be actively pursue the formation of a skill partnership to meet the opportunity and challenge of potential small modular reactor development in oldbury in my constituency do the minister welcome their proactive approach and will she join i in meet they to well understand the support that the further education sector need to deliver this vital work 
 i would be delighted to meet the hon member and talk about her plan 
 what assurance can the minister give i that energy intensive industry in stoke on trent such as ceramic will benefit from the investment come from this government and will not get leave behind in our transition to net 
 my hon friend make a very good point we be talk about this issue in the tea room only this morning and i will meet the ceramics sector and he thing in the new year to talk about some of the challenge it face we be absolutely committed to support the sector 
 oil and gas field have be license for new drilling of dangerous fossil fuel but be still await final approval the government pause those decision while do a consultation but the consultation will not change the science if we be to meet our climate target those fossil fuel must stay in the ground will the secretary of state do the right thing by the poor in our country who be always at the sharp end of climate action and ensure that those licence will not be grant 
 this be a government with a world lead position when it come to oil and gas and we will do the right thing for the environment and climate change and the right thing to ensure that there be a just transition in the north sea 
 on behalf of my constituent i want to thank the secretary of state the minister of state the parliamentary private secretaries and the whole team for the excellent work that have be carry out to deliver justice on the mineworker pension can i urge they to act with alacrity in relation to the british coal staff superannuation scheme and may i invite the minister to look at some of the energy pilot that be make use of mine water from abandon mine working 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who have be a brilliant campaigner on this issue for a very long time my hon friend the minister of state will have hear what he say this be the difference this be a labour government deliver justice for mineworker across our country and their family which be all part of deliver our mission for the country 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on the investigation by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman into the way that change in the state pension age be communicate to woman bear in the 1950s 
 the state pension be the foundation for a secure retirement that be why this government be commit to the pension triple lock which will increase the new state pension by more than £ a year from this april and deliver an additional £ of spending over the course of this parliament and it be why government of all colour have a responsibility to ensure that change to the state pension age be properly communicate so that people can plan for their retirement 
 before i turn to the government ’s response to the ombudsman ’s report i want to be clear about what this report investigate and what it do not the report be not an investigation into the actual decision to increase the state pension age for woman in or to accelerate that increase in a decision that the then conservative chancellor george osborne say 
 probably save more money than anything else we ’ve do 
 that comment understandably anger many woman and spark the original woman against state pension inequality campaign the ombudsman be clear that policy decision to increase the state pension age in and since be take by parliament and consider lawful by the court this investigation be about how change in the state pension age be communicate by the department for work and pensions and the impact this may have have on the ability of woman bear in the 1950 to plan for their retirement 
 i know that this be an issue of huge concern to many woman that have span multiple parliaments like so many other problem that we have inherit from the conservatives this be something that the previous government should have deal with instead they kick the can down the road and leave we to pick up the piece but today we deal with it head on the pensions minister the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for wycombe emma reynolds and i have give the ombudsman ’s report serious consideration and look in detail at the finding and at information and advice provide by the department that be not available to we before come into government 
 the then ombudsman look at case he find that the department provide adequate and accurate information on change to the state pension age between and include through leaflet and pension education campaign and on its website however decision make between and lead to a month delay in send out letter to woman bear in the 1950 the ombudsman say that these delay do not result in the woman suffer direct financial loss but that they be maladministration 
 we accept that the month delay in send out letter be maladministration and on behalf of the government i apologise this government be determined to learn all the lesson from what go wrong and i will say more about that in a moment we also agree that the woman suffer no direct financial loss because of the   maladministration however we do not agree with the ombudsman ’s approach to injustice or remedy and i want to spell out why 
 the report do not properly take into account research show that there be actually considerable awareness that the state pension age be increase it reference research from show that of woman age over be aware of their state pension age but it do not sufficiently recognise evidence from the same research that of woman age to the very group that cover woman bear in the 1950 be aware that the state pension age be increase or research from show that of woman age to be aware that the state pension age be increase 
 secondly the report say that if letter have be send out early it would have affect what woman know about the state pension age however we do not agree that send letter early would have have the impact that the ombudsman say research give to the ombudsman show that only around a quarter of people who be send unsolicited letter actually remember receive they or read they so we can not accept that in the great majority of case send a letter early would have affect whether woman know that their state pension age be rise or increase their opportunity to make informed decision 
 these fact that most woman know the state pension age be increase and that letter be not as significant as the ombudsman say as well as other reason have inform our conclusion that there should be no scheme of financial compensation to 1950s bear woman in response to the ombudsman ’s report 
 the ombudsman say that as a matter of principle redress and compensation should normally reflect individual impact however the report itself acknowledge that assess the individual circumstance of woman bear in the 1950 would have a significant cost and administrative burden it have take the ombudsman nearly year to investigate the circumstance of sample complaint for the dwp to set up a scheme and invite woman to set out their detailed personal circumstance would take thousand of staff year to process 
 even if there be a scheme in which woman could self certify that they be not aware of change to their state pension age and that they have suffer as a result it would be impossible to verify the information provide the alternative put forward in the report be a flat rate compensation scheme at level of the ombudsman ’s scale of injustice this would provide £ to £ per person at a total cost of between £ and £ 
 give that the vast majority of woman know the state pension age be increase the government do not believe that pay a flat rate to all woman at a cost of up to £ would be a fair or proportionate use of taxpayer money not least when the previous government fail to set aside a single penny for any compensation scheme and leave we a £ black hole in the public finance 
 this have be an extremely difficult decision to take but we believe it be the right course of action and we be determined to learn all the lesson to ensure that this type of maladministration never happen again   we want to work with the ombudsman to develop a detailed action plan out of the report so that every and all lesson be learn secondly we be commit to set clear and sufficient notice of any change in the state pension age so that people can properly plan for their retirement thirdly i have tasked official to develop a strategy for effective timely and modern communication on the state pension that use the most up to date method build on change that have already be make such as the online check your state pension service that give a personal forecast of a person ’s state pension include when they can take it because size rarely fit all 
 as i say we have not take this decision lightly but we believe it be the right decision because the great majority of woman know the state pension age be increase because send letter early would not have make a difference for most and because the propose compensation scheme be not fair or value for taxpayer money 
 i know there be woman bear in the 1950 who want and deserve a well life they have work hard in pay job and in bring up their family many be struggle financially with the cost of live and few saving to fall back on they worry about their health and how their child and grandchild will get on 
 to those woman i say this government will protect the pension triple lock so your state pension will increase by up to £ a year by the end of this parliament we will drive down waiting list so you get the treatment you need with an extra £ of funding for the nhs this year and next and we will deliver the job home and opportunity your family need to build a well life i know that many 1950s bear woman will be disappoint about this specific decision but we believe it be the right decision and the fair decision i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for work and pensions for advance sight of her statement and i thank the ombudsman and his team for their work on this important matter 
 in march this year the parliamentary and health service ombudsman publish its final report into the way that change to the state pension age be communicate to woman bear in the 1950 the report take over year to produce and reflect the complexity of the issue it span a year period across different government date back to parliament ’s decision in for the state pension age for man and woman to be equalise in a long overdue move towards gender equality 
 as the chief executive of the ombudsman set out the department for work and pensions fully co operate with the ombudsman through its investigation and provide thousand of page of detailed evidence to support it it be because we take the work of the ombudsman so seriously that it be right for the government to fully and properly consider the finding and we be commit to work with parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response however as the house will know the general election be call less than month    later give that it have take labour month since the general election to provide its finding i be sure the secretary of state would agree that there be insufficient time to take a considered and fair decision between the publication of the report and the election 
 i be glad that the secretary of state have pick this issue up since come into office and have bring her statement to the house today i will be consider it in more detail in the day and week to come as well as the basis on which she have reach her conclusion i be sure that the government ’s statement today will be a huge disappointment to waspi woman and i recognise the strength of feeling about the issue 
 as a constituency mp i have meet waspi woman who live in faversham and mid kent and hear their personal story no doubt campaigner will note the government ’s apology for the decision make between and that lead to a month delay in send out letter which the ombudsman identify as maladministration but let we be clear the decision to provide no compensation be the government ’s decision and they need to own it i be not go to let they get away with say that there be no compensation because of a fictional black hole in the public finance the country ’s financial position now be a result of their political choice they should not try to dodge responsibility by suggest to waspi woman that if time be different they might have come to a different conclusion government compensation should always be base on what be fair and just 
 that bring i to some question give the announcement that they will not be provide financial compensation will the government put forward any other non financial form of remedy for the woman affect will the secretary of state be involve the waspi campaigner in the action plan she have refer to and what be the timeline for that 
 the secretary of state claim that pensioner be well off under labour but let we not forget that it be the conservatives who introduce and protect the triple lock which have see the state pension increase by £ since and there be now few pensioner live in absolute poverty do the right hon lady know how many woman affect by her decision be on pension credit 
 labour ’s own impact assessment show that its decision to scrap the winter fuel payment will see woman lose out how many of those hit by those cut to the winter fuel payment be also affect by today ’s announcement 
 finally give that the government have dismiss the recommendation of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman will the secretary of state set out what implication she see for the future of the ombudsman 
 i welcome the overall tone of the hon lady ’s comment i be glad that she be finally consider her party ’s response to the ombudsman ’s report and i be sure that the whole house look forward to its detailed response to the finding and recommendation which be not provide when the conservatives be in government 
 i be sorry that the hon lady still fail to take responsibility for the state of the public finance we have take full responsibility for that and have take   difficult decision on the public finance we have also take this very difficult decision in response to the ombudsman ’s report and have provide that to the house as quickly as we have be able give the huge amount of information we have have to go through 
 the hon lady ask about next step we have clear thing that we intend to do we will produce a detailed action plan we want to work with the ombudsman on that so that we can ensure that the delay the maladministration and the month delay in send out notification never happen again and i be perfectly happy to consider work with the woman to make sure we get that right it be extremely important that wherever possible we provide personalise tailor information pension be a hugely complicated area and we want people to be empower with that information and knowledge we have to do it in all sort of different format because it be individual to the person and we need to get that right in future 
 the hon lady also mention pension credit and the winter fuel payment i will say to she as i do yesterday that we have see a increase in the number of claim for pension credit since we launch our campaign more than more people be claim pension credit now we want to deal with yet another thing the conservative government leave we with which be pensioner not get the pension credit or the winter fuel payment they be entitle to 
 these be difficult decision we be a responsible government and we face up to our responsibility i look forward to member on the conservative benches finally do the same 
 this be clearly not a decision that the secretary of state have take lightly and an apology on behalf of the department for work and pensions be long overdue but let we make no mistake the responsibility for this lie squarely with the conservative party which oversee the maladministration and kick the can down the road yet again for we to clear up the mess that must be put right can my right hon friend assure my constituent that a serious case like this will not occur again and that this government will continue to do everything we can to support pensioner go forward 
 i can assure my hon friend ’s constituent in clwyd north that we want to learn all the lesson from the maladministration that we accept take place we have to get people timely effective and personal communication and not just about their state pension age but about all aspect of pension so that they can properly plan for their retirement the pensions minister and i will go through that with a fine toothed comb to do everything possible to make sure it do not happen again 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 and for the record the liberal democrats play a significant part in government in introduce the triple lock for our pensioner it be important that people acknowledge that 
 the government ’s decision be nothing short of a betrayal of waspi woman i know that as in my constituency of torbay across the united kingdom there will be million of woman who be shock and horrify at that decision that the government have inherit an awful state for our economy be no excuse that the woman be be hit by the mistake of the tories and that the labour government be now use that as a shield be utterly wrong headed will the secretary of state reflect on the decision 
 the matter go to the ombudsman for its consider review and the liberal democrats have long support the ombudsman ’s finding i be shocked that the government be take a pick and mix approach to those finding and we therefore ask the secretary of state to seriously reconsider the decision 
 i gently say to the hon gentleman who i know be not in the house at the time that the decision to accelerate the increase in the state pension age in be take by the conservative and liberal democrat coalition government it be that which anger and annoy many woman and lead to the waspi campaign we accept that there be a month delay in send out letter and we apologise for that but we do not agree with the ombudsman ’s approach to injustice or remedy we do not believe that the letter would have have an impact on most as the ombudsman say and when of woman know that the state pension age be increase we can not accept that that flat rate of payment of up to £ would be a fair or appropriate use of taxpayer money i know that will disappoint some woman bear in the 1950s but we believe it be the right and fair decision 
 i share the secretary of state ’s concern about the black hole that be leave this will have be a difficult decision for she to make and bring to the house today however i think about the many people across all our constituency who have contact we about the matter include my constituent valerie who write to i and say 
 we simply can not afford to wait any long for justice give that more than waspi woman have tragically die since the ombudsman ’s finding be publish more than month ago 
 i know that valerie and many other in my constituency will be very disappointed the secretary of state say that she accept the maladministration do that not then mean accountability 
 we do indeed take responsibility for the maladministration between and and a month delay in send the letter out i want to reiterate to my hon friend and to the house that this be not a decision about the increase in the state pension age which so many woman be aggrieve about it be about how that be communicate we accept that those letter should have go out early but even if we have send those it would not have make a difference for most when of those 1950 bear woman know that the state pension age be increase we do not think that the propose compensation scheme be fair or proportionate that be why we have take this extremely difficult decision 
 the parliamentary and health service ombudsman ’s report say what many waspi woman across my constituency have be say for year which be that between and the dwp and the last labour government let they down i be therefore grateful to the secretary of state for her apology but that will come as cold comfort to those who be in this situation in the face of no financial compensation if i be right in what i hear she say mitigation be too complicated and that it be someone else ’s fault that will be no comfort to those impact what conversation do the secretary of state plan to have with the waspi woman to see what more support can be put in place for those most impact 
 i meet the waspi campaign in opposition when i be appoint shadow work and pensions minister the minister for pensions be the of her kind to meet the waspi campaign for year and she be happy to meet they again i say to the hon lady who feel very deeply about the issue that we will learn all the lesson from what go wrong with the delay in send the letter out but we do not agree that even if we have do that they would have make the difference that the ombudsman claim this be not about the matter be too complicated we do not believe that when of woman age to know the state pension age be increase a flat rate compensation scheme cost up to £ would be a fair or proportionate use of taxpayer money 
 the all party parliamentary group on state pension inequality have find that huge number of woman have suffer significant financial hardship many have even lose their home the secretary of state must realise that her apology be welcome but that it be not enough for they frankly it be unprecedented for a government to agree with the finding of an ombudsman on the hand but on the other to refuse to initiate redress when clear injustice have occur what will the secretary of state say to reassure those woman who have lose everything 
 i understand the concern that my hon friend raise but i reiterate the finding from the ombudsman ’s report that there be no direct financial loss we agree that those letter should have be send out early we will learn all the lesson need to put that right i be more than happy to discuss precisely how we will do that with the all party parliamentary group so that that kind of maladministration of send out letter never happen again 
 last month the word waspi make it into the collins english dictionary which be a credit to the campaigner behind it do the secretary of state agree that she have go through the ombudsman ’s report with to use her own word a fine toothed comb in order to get the answer that she always want to find in the place 
 no i do not agree with that it be only when we get into government that we be able to see all the information and advice provide by the department i do not go into it in the way that the hon gentleman suggest that be not correct this report be not about the policy decision and woman against state pension age   increase that decision be take in agree to by subsequent parliaments and deem lawful by the court in the ombudsman ’s report be not about the state pension age increase it be about how they be communicate i take responsibility for that and will make sure that we do everything possible to put it right 
 this be undoubtedly a tough choice it be welcome that the government will seek to learn the lesson and develop a new strategy for clear and timely comms will the secretary of state reassure the house not only that the strategy will be comprehensive but that those with accessibility requirement be properly informed of any change 
 my hon friend raise an extremely important point which be that a size fit all approach will not work even if it ever do we need to provide tailor information in an accessible way in an easily understand and available format we will work extremely closely with all the necessary group to develop that information and crucially give sufficient notice the ombudsman ’s report deal with the decision make between and but what greatly concern many woman and lead to the original waspi campaign be the decision in to accelerate and bring forward increase in the state pension age therefore that other commitment to give sufficient and timely notice so that people can properly plan for their retirement be extremely important 
 the secretary of state say in her statement research give to the ombudsman show only around a quarter of people who be send unsolicited letter actually remember receive and read they i would like to know the term of that research do it for example say on the envelope important financial information affect your pension if something like that be on an envelope i think that there would be a very different response rate give that she be have trouble accept that people look at serious letter that really affect they perhaps the chancellor could use some of her ability to get these message across as be so successful in the case of advise pensioner that they would be lose the winter fuel allowance 
 i be happy to write to the right hon gentleman about this research and its finding which be robust i reflect on the fact that of the sample case that the ombudsman look into have receive a letter but i be more than happy to provide he with the detail of that research 
 in the framing of my question to the secretary of state i wish to say that i be appal by this announcement i have campaign with waspi woman as have many parliamentary colleague and this be an incredible let down for they in my opinion waspi woman certainly do not need word of disappointment and hollow statement what they need be justice do the secretary of state not agree with that 
 i believe that this be a difficult decision but the right and fair we accept that there have be maladministration once the department have reach   its decision those letter should have be send out for the reason that i have explain we do not accept the ombudsman ’s approach to injustice remedy or compensation we have to take difficult decision in government but this be about what i think be right and fair i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the matter in more detail if he so wish 
 it be a gross understatement for the secretary of state to say that 1950 woman will be disappoint especially give that this new government be set a precedent by ignore an independent resolution process i signpost constituent to the ombudsman on a regular basis we all do it be of the way that we hold the government and government body to account and it be a core part of our democracy can the secretary of state explain how we can have faith in that process if the government choose to ignore the ombudsman ’s finding give the fact that as a constituent mp the secretary of state herself support the waspi campaign can she advise whether the £ black hole have have any consequence on her decision making 
 we do campaign against the acceleration of change to the state pension age bring forward by the conservative liberal democrat government but that be not what this decision be about the decision on the state pension age have already be take i do value the ombudsman ’s role i refer many case myself we accept his finding on maladministration but we do not accept his view on injustice none the less the ombudsman continue to have an important role to play for many constituency mp and i for will continue to refer case to the ombudsman as i always have do 
 the government be right to have apologise to waspi woman today and my right hon friend be also right to have acknowledge the significant disappointment that will be feel what be important be that this labour government be act to boost pension pot across the country do the secretary of state agree that it be important that through the measure the government be take we not only protect pension pot but actually enhance they so that pensioner be well off 
 the pension scheme bill will do precisely that of the really important thing that we want to do be to consolidate small pension pot so that they deliver well value and well result for those in retirement that be exactly what that bill will do we want to see the very good for pensioner and also the very good for uk plc which be why our pension reform be so important my hon friend the minister responsible for pension will be deliver on that in the month and year ahead 
 anas sarwar say that under his leadership waspi woman will finally receive the justice they deserve be the justice they deserve be pay less than their male counterpart throughout their career be the justice they deserve be sack or force to resign from their job when they have child be the justice they deserve the removal   of the winter fuel payment why be the labour government absolutely determine to take every opportunity to screw over 1950 bear woman 
 i be proud of the last labour government ’s record on help the lowest pay woman pensioner and of the improvement that we deliver this be not about that issue this be about the way that the state pension age be communicate if the hon lady want a different approach the snp government in scotland can provide that by use the £ settlement the big ever in the history of devolution that we have provide 
 this will be a sad moment for the woman in stoke on trent central who i have campaign alongside for justice and a fair transition i understand the secretary of state ’s need to balance the budget give what be leave by the previous government but be this a case of no compensation now because of the economic circumstance that we find ourselves in or be it no compensation ever if we find ourselves in the future in a much well economic state will she consider re address this issue and see what compensation might be available for the woman who be affect 
 we do not agree with the ombudsman ’s approach to injustice or compensation we do not believe that send those letter early even though we should have do would have make the difference that the ombudsman claim we do not believe that give that of 1950 bear woman know that the state pension age be increase a flat rate compensation scheme cost up to £ be a fair or appropriate use of taxpayer money however we will learn lesson from that maladministration to ensure that it never happen again 
 every single of we in this house rely on the parliamentary and health service ombudsman to ensure that our constituent get redress when the phso make a similar judgment against equitable life the government come forward with a compensation programme will the secretary of state commit to have a bind vote in this house on the decision so that the house can decide whether what the government be propose be justice for waspi woman i certainly do not believe that it be 
 i be sure the right hon gentleman could have encourage his party to do a compensation scheme when he be in government the reason the ombudsman actually refer the report to parliament be because he do not believe the last government when they be run the department for work and pensions would deal with it properly this government take our responsibility seriously and that be why we have come to parliament today to make this difficult decision 
 a conservative member say to i this morning that be the secretary of state for the dwp be probably the hard job in government and i think today we can really see that i pay tribute to the waspi woman in my constituency and in particular gina who email i regularly about   this issue what reassurance can the secretary of state give waspi woman such as gina that we will do everything we can to support they and to ensure that issue like this do not happen again 
 as i say in my statement i understand that many woman bear in the 1950 face a real struggle and on this specific decision they may well be disappoint but our commitment to pensioner and to the pension triple lock will deliver an extra £ into the basic state pension over this parliament our investment in the nhs about which many 1950s bear woman be desperately worried of £ this year and next show our commitment to the issue that matter to those woman as i say they may be disappoint and indeed angry about the decision but we believe that it be the fair and right decision however i would be more than happy to talk to my hon friend in further detail so that he can pass on comment from waspi woman in his constituency 
 i speak on behalf of helen from my home town of bampton and the waspi woman in my constituency they be not disappointed they be devastate as be i because mistakenly as it turn out i believe that this labour government who be support by million of woman across this country who rightly turn their back on the conservatives have some probity and decency do the secretary of state agree that it turn out that they have neither 
 no 
 many former ministers and current shadow ministers have make clear that they do not support a compensation scheme so be this not just another example of this labour government have to take the difficult but necessary decision that those member run away from 
 it be true this be a long run issue span multiple parliaments that be deliver to the last government and we have deal with it we have deal with it seriously but also as quickly as we can we take our responsibility seriously it be a difficult decision but i believe it be the right and fair 
 how long will we have this government give the excuse that they can not do thing because the last lot do not do they will the secretary of state remember that she be now in government when she be in opposition she and other member of her party campaign for waspi woman the fact have not change administratively mistake be make and financially there be still an impact and now the ombudsman have find in favour she can not hide behind say that we have no money we just have the secretary of state for energy security and net in question boast that he be bung billion of pound to power company yet we can not honour the commitment make to people who be wrongly treat in the pension system 
 i hate to disagree with the right hon gentleman but i do not say it be only about there be no money i say it be because we do not agree   that if we have send those letter early it would have make the difference that he say and because when of woman age to know the state pension age be increase we do not believe a flat rate be pertinent i say this to he we do take the public finance seriously we have to make difficult decision and we can not spend more than we have we will continue with that approach but base on our value we do not believe that what have be set out be the right or fair way forward i have come to the house honestly to make that decision plain but i would be happy to talk to he in more detail if he would like 
 the secretary of state say the report be about the way this be communicate to those 1950 bear woman and that early letter would not have make a difference but they would have make a difference to individual financial planning their retirement date the notice they give to their job and the wide family arrangement and commitment they have make there have undoubtedly be loss for those 1950 bear woman my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell   just give the government an opportunity to reconsider that at some point in the future be she sure that she will not take that offer 
 i know my hon friend care passionately about this issue and many other issue relate to pensioner i repeat what i say in my statement and indeed what the ombudsman say which be there be no direct financial loss for the woman this be not about the increase in the state pension age it be about how it be communicate the research show that only in people who get an unsolicited letter remember receive or read it so send those letter out early would not have make the difference we can not justify a flat rate compensation scheme or indeed an individualised compensation scheme on that basis 
 when the secretary of state be in opposition she say she be a long stand supporter of waspi woman give that what would she say to the waspi woman in my constituency the in her constituency and those across the country who will be disappoint at her rejection of any compensation even if not at the level the ombudsman recommend
