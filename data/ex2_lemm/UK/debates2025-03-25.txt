 i have a special announcement to make today be jim shannon ’s birthday 
 hear hear 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to shift care from major hospital into community hospital 
 on behalf of his majesty ’s government i congratulate   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   on reach his birthday i think you say mr speaker but i be sure you mean 
 in response to my hon friend   the member for south dorset lloyd hatton we promise in opposition to transform the nhs into a neighbourhood health service and we have hit the ground run as a step we have announce the big boost to gp funding in year an extra £ which will recruit more gps we be deliver extra urgent dental appointment and we have give adult and child ’s hospice a once in a generation £ funding boost at the same time we be deliver our plan for change and have cut waiting list for month in a row change have begin but the good be still to come 
 i too pass on my good wish to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 in south dorset we urgently need to restore clinic and shift service back into our community hospital in weymouth portland swanage and wareham sadly the previous conservative government hollow out those community hospital mean that service leave our town to go far and far up the road combine with poor transport link this mean that many local people in my patch find it difficult to access the care they need with that in mind what step be the secretary of state take to restore clinic and service in our community hospital and will he support my campaign to restore the chemotherapy clinic at wareham community hospital 
 the big thrust of our year plan will be to deliver on the shift from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention we believe that by move service close to people ’s home and indeed into their home we will be able to provide fast diagnosis and fast access to treatment which will be well for patient and for taxpayer through the reform we be make to the structure of nhs england and the governance of the nhs we be also preside over the big devolution in the history of the nhs with more power and decision take close to the community they serve in that spirit i urge my hon friend to make representation locally to his integrate care board as i know he be do minister will also be open to receive his representation 
 follow the government ’s regrettable decision not to fund watford general hospital ’s refurbishment in this parliament provide community care facility in a town such as borehamwood in my constituency a significant town without its own dedicated facility be more important than ever will the secretary of state undertake to use his office to urge the icb and other to get their act together so that we can finally have those facility in borehamwood 
 i be very sympathetic to the argument that the right hon gentleman make about the importance of neighbourhood health service in borehamwood and indeed in town and community across the country what i be not sympathetic to be a former deputy prime minister complain about the state of the nhs which he play a key part in create when he sit around the cabinet table 
 in hospital admission occur in a person ’s last year of life and of people will die in an nhs hospital clearly that be not acceptable when people be at their frailest what be my right hon friend do to invest in virtual ward so that we can keep those people at home and in the district nurse workforce to ensure that district nurse have a proper career structure and that theirs can be a profession of choice once again 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the innovation and the impact of virtual ward i have see at hand the impact they can have not just in provide well value for taxpayer and free up hospital bed for those who genuinely need to be in hospital but in provide what everyone want which be to receive high quality care in the comfort of their own home wherever possible that will be a big part of our year plan and of course it will be underpin by really good community nursing and community healthcare team 
 stepping hill hospital in hazel grove have a huge repair backlog patient be have to park mile away to get to the hospital corridor have be flood and there have be frequent power cut alongside stockport council the local hospital trust and the community i be call for an additional site in stockport town centre whether that be a diagnostic centre or otherwise what assurance can the health secretary give my constituent that they will be able to get the health service they need close to they and what support can he provide 
 i be well aware of the challenge at stepping hill hospital and the need for support and investment in service in stockport not least thank to the representation of my hon friend   the member for stockport navendu mishra we be look carefully at this situation and be commit to work with leader locally to try to improve the quality of and access to service to give local people what they deserve 
 a new state of the art surgical centre be set to open at the victoria infirmary in northwich in the next few week the new facility will be a centre of excellence and a regional hub for outstanding cataract care and it be an excellent example of how we can reduce pressure on our major hospital while make the good use of facility in the heart of our community will the secretary of state join i in congratulate the mid cheshire hospital trust on complete this project can i invite he to join i on a visit to the centre in the come month 
 i join my hon friend in congratulate the local trust on the work it be do and the impact it be have and i would be delighted to pay a visit as soon as my diary allow 
 the new st george ’s nhs hub in hornchurch have free up space in queen ’s hospital in romford to remodel the accident and emergency there will the secretary of state now fund that remodelle so that our constituent can get well emergency care 
 i be grateful to the hon member for raise the need for investment in the accident and emergency at queen ’s hospital in romford as she allude to that department serve my constituent too so this will be a rare occasion at the dispatch box where i urge and encourage she to lobby the minister of state my hon friend   the member for bristol south karin smyth because in such decision i must recuse myself however she will know where my sympathy lie 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dental service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dental service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dental service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dental service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dental service 
 rebuild our broken dentistry system be a priority for this government we be already roll out extra urgent dental appointment a year as promise in our manifesto we have launch a supervise toothbrushing scheme for to year old and we be committed to reform the dental contract and make nhs dentistry fit for the future in the long term 
 in kettering we know the scale of the challenge face nhs dentistry after year of tory failure my constituent regularly tell i how impossible it be to get an appointment some be drive ten of mile to see a dentist and it be simply a scandal how many child be admit to hospital with tooth decay while it can not be rebuild overnight in kettering we welcome the extra urgent appointment which be a vital step can the minister confirm that it be this government who will make nhs dentistry fit for the future 
 my hon friend be absolutely right after year of tory neglect and incompetence far too many people be still struggle to find an nhs appointment this government be tackle the challenge for patient try to access nhs dental care by deliver more urgent dental appointment a year and by recruit new dentist to area that need they my hon friend ’s local integrate care board have be ask to deliver nearly of the additional urgent appointment i be in no doubt that she will continue to campaign tirelessly on behalf of her constituent 
 my constituent kevin buckley have his nhs dentist shut with no notice nhs dentist in knowsley be not take on any new patient and he be stick this be not just a local issue but a national crisis what action will the minister take to address the shortage of nhs dentist 
 i be sorry to hear of the difficulty face by mr buckley sadly that be a challenge we face nationally after year of abject failure from those now on the opposition benches there be no quick fix or easy answer but we be committed to reform the contract and help those who need it most my hon friend ’s local icb have be ask to deliver more than additional urgent care appointment from april onwards get care to those constituent who need it most the north west have also be allocate post in the golden hello scheme to recruit dentist into underserved area 
 more than in year old in stoke on trent have tooth decay that be the bad rate in the west midland and be above the national average child in deprive area like much of my constituency of stoke on trent north and kidsgrove be twice as likely to suffer and that be not acceptable can the minister please outline what step the government will take to reduce regional inequality in nhs dental access for child 
 it be shameful that tooth decay be the big reason for hospital admission of child age between and and the inequality surround that be stark on   march we confirm a £ investment in supervised toothbrushing for to year old the scheme be target at child in the most   deprive area those in index of multiple deprivation group and and will reach up to child our innovative partnership with colgate palmolive will result in the donation of more than toothbrush and toothpaste provide outstanding value for taxpayer money 
 aldershot and farnborough be dental desert my constituent nick have an infect wisdom tooth and be in agony he have be register with a practice in farnborough but it kick he off its patient list he obtain an emergency appointment through but week later the infection be back he be leave with little choice but to go private which cost he £ 700—10 time what the treatment would have cost on the nhs can the minister explain how labour ’s plan for change will help to prevent such case from be repeat as we end the year of dentistry failure that we see under the conservatives 
 my hon friend have demonstrate again that she be a tireless campaigner for the people of aldershot and i be sorry to hear of the challenge face by her constituent this government will deliver more urgent dental appointment a year and will recruit new dentist to the area that need they most my hon friend ’s local icb have be ask to deliver nearly of those additional urgent care appointment in the year from april in the long term we will reform the dental contract with the sector with a shift to focus on prevention and improve the retention of nhs dentist 
 the secretary of state and ministers commitment to more emergency dental appointment be already take effect in my nhs area with an extra slot and the feedback be excellent however constituent have tell i that some dentist seem to be remove non emergency patient from their list can the minister please reassure they that their nhs dentist will be there when they need they 
 as my hon friend say we be deliver additional urgent appointment patient be not limit to a register practice in england and practice be require to keep their status up to date on the nhs website anyone struggle to find a dentist should go to nhs.uk or call it be also clear that while nhs england be not mandate an approach to the purchasing of these additional appointment icb could consider either buy more appointment through new or recommissioned contract or modify exist contract and/or use flexible commissioning 
 the minister be aware of my concern about the inability of some fully qualified ukrainian dentist to practise because of the restriction place on they by the general dental council i know that the minister have write to the gdc about this but have he receive a reply 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for the constructive meeting and discussion that we have on this matter as he will know we be explore the use of provisional registration for overseas dentist and we be urge the gdc to arrange more examination for dentist i have a meeting set up in short order with the head of the gdc and i will keep the right hon gentleman post on that conversation 
 my constituent be be force to travel out of county to coventry or evesham to obtain basic nhs dental care do the minister agree that it be a disgrace that access to an nhs dentist have become a postcode lottery what urgent step be the government take to end this dental desert and restore nhs service to rural community such as mine 
 i absolutely agree the state of nhs dentistry in our country be shameful the golden hello scheme enable dentist to receive a £ join bonus payment to work in dental desert and we be negotiate with the british dental association the long term reform of the contract the issue be not the number of dentist in the country but the paucity of dentist who be do nhs work 
 the north west have some of the bad level of child ’s oral health in england with cheshire and merseyside fall below the national average in rural village in my constituency like bunbury where bus service have be cut and kelsall where a dentist be keen to open an nhs practice but face barrier due to city centre prioritisation resident be struggle to access nhs dental care give the challenge of rural access what step be the minister take to ensure that nhs dental provision be available in those rural community 
 i find it quite striking when conservative member stand up and describe the abysmal state of nhs dentistry it make i think well who create this mess in the place but that be as an aside the fact be that we have the golden hello scheme for dentist to come and work in so call dental desert we recognise that the fundamental problem be around incentive for dentist to do nhs work that be why we be do a long term contract negotiation to ensure we have an nhs dentistry contract that be fit for purpose and where every penny allocate to nhs dentistry be spend on nhs dentistry 
 there be an urgent need for dental training in norfolk so can the minister confirm that the government will enable the office for student to allocate new dental training place in the east of england to start in 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question i have meet hon member from the area and make it clear that in principle we support any creation of new teaching capacity for dentistry what i have also set out be that before we can give an instruction to the office for student to go ahead with that work we have to have the settlement of the comprehensive spending review so we know what our financial envelope be we will not have that until june but certainly we will be look at that as and when we know whether the funding will be available 
 i call jim shannon 
 hear hear 
 there ’ only jim shannon by the way you know laughter mr speaker thank you very much for your birthday wish i be terribly embarrassed i thank right hon   and hon member for their kind wish as i often say i do not count the year i make the year count that be the important thing 
 can i ask the minister a very important question what discussion have he have with the education secretary on provide more financial support to young student who want to study dentistry to ease the burden of high cost associate with study dentistry which many young people may find off putting 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question and i congratulate he again on his birthday laughter he raise an important point on teaching and training in dentistry there be not enough capacity in the system we absolutely want to ensure that we be build that capacity as i say a lot of that will depend on the comprehensive spending review settlement in june i would be more than happy to discuss the issue with he in great detail once we have a well sense of where we be on the funding 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the provision of health service for woman 
 the government be commit to improve woman ’s health outcome we have already take urgent action to tackle the gynaecology list through the elective reform plan and we recently announce an £ trial use ai tool to detect breast cancer case early the year health plan will set out how we will tackle the factor that lead to poor health outcome and the improvement we expect to see 
 what assessment have the minister make of the adequacy of research into and the provision of fibroid treatment for woman take into consideration that fibroid be time more likely to appear in black woman than in white woman 
 the government welcome the work my hon friend have undertake and the work of the caribbean and african health network in highlight health inequality for black woman she highlight shocking and unacceptable statistic the national institute for health and care research have fund a significant amount of research into woman ’s health issue include a £ trial compare treatment option for fibroid i be happy to make sure she be update on that work and on the detail of that work 
 early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can make a huge difference to the woman involve and of course to the prognosis and the cost to the state of health provision i welcome the reference in the cancer plan to early diagnosis but what specifically will the government do to encourage great awareness of the full range of breast cancer symptom and to encourage woman to get early diagnosis and treatment for well outcome 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that question and for the work he have support on behalf of his wife to raise awareness screen access   and uptake be shockingly low across the country right now and look at that be a key part of what we need to do to ensure that woman come forward for the screening test the ai work will support the fast response time so that we can get woman treat more quickly and will absolutely form part of what we need to do in the come year 
 i want to put on the record my thank to the health secretary for come to nottingham last week and meet some of the family who have be harm by extremely serious failing in maternity service at nottingham university hospitals nhs trust and for his sincere commitment to they it be clear just how moved he be by their story of their ask be that the government implement the recommendation from the shrewsbury and telford ockenden review so i ask the minister today to commit to do that 
 i know that my hon friend and other members represent that area have support the trust and particularly the family who have be affect as she highlight my right hon friend the health secretary visit last week and be deeply move by those story and have commit to visit again the government be work through those recommendation and will update the house shortly 
 follow on from the question ask by   the hon member for nottingham east nadia whittome i hold a debate in westminster hall a few week ago on maternity service and speak to family across the country who have experience failure in the system that ultimately leave they without their baby to take home it be a devastating experience for all involve the immediate and essential action in the ockenden review be support by the previous government and the secretary of state for health have be vocal in his support for their implementation however those family want to know how quickly they will see real change in maternity service up and down the country so that family can confidently go to deliver their baby 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the impact of the failure in maternity service on woman and their family across the country as she highlight my right hon friend the health secretary take this matter personally and be look at it we will continue to work closely with donna ockenden on those recommendation and will continue to update the house regularly this be an important issue for member across the house represent their constituent whether in this chamber or westminster hall and we be very keen to ensure that we support staff build that confidence for woman and their family and give they a good experience of maternity service 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the independent review into datum and statistic on sex and gender by professor alice sullivan 
 i be grateful to professor sullivan for her report sex and gender identity be not always the same and it be important for patient that we record both accurately i know the house will share my concern at some of the finding from professor sullivan ’s report such as trans patient not be invite for cancer screening because of how their gender be record i can assure the house that i be already act on report last week i instruct the health service to immediately suspend application for nhs number change for under-18s to safeguard child take such action do not prevent the nhs from recording recognise and respect trans people ’s gender identity 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response which will give much need reassurance to patient across the uk any public body that fail to accurately record sex and instead conflate it with gender put people at serious risk of harm unfortunately this type of organisational capture have be widespread across scotland with devastating consequence can the secretary of state assure i that he will raise this issue with his counterpart in the scottish government to ensure that nhs scotland do not put my constituent at risk 
 i will absolutely undertake to share the approach we be take with my counterpart across the united kingdom the approach i have always take be that understand the importance of biological sex that recognise understand and support that someone ’s gender identity may not always match their biological sex and that seek to navigate a way through what have be an extremely toxic and sometimes harmful debate in a way that protect the sex base right of woman and protect tran people and their identity i know that my colleague across government be take an equally sensitive approach and i think it would be in everyone ’s interest if we see a similar approach across the whole of the united kingdom it be important not just in the provision of service but in accurate datum and research that we make that distinction which do not in any way undermine respect for people ’s gender identity 
 the inquest into the tragic death of a young woman who live in eastleigh have highlight the importance of continuity of specialist care for vulnerable people who move home my constituent alex be still wait for an appointment for ongoing specialist care year after move to eastleigh will the minister meet i to discuss the provision of mental healthcare in my constituency 
 this question be about sex and gender do not worry i be sure that the secretary of state have the message 
 i now call the shadow minister 
 give the finding of the sullivan review on patient and health safety which come about as a result of inaccurate and poor data collection can the right hon gentleman confirm what meeting he have have with secretary of state for science innovation and technology to discuss the reliability of the datum on sex   that be intend to be use by the digital verification platform in the data use and access bill 
 i be grateful to the shadow minister for her question i speak to the science secretary on too frequent a basis on a daily basis he and i be both look very carefully at the finding of the sullivan review and work through its implication for both the health and care service for which i be responsible and for the government digital and data service for which he be responsible 
 the uk health security agency for which the secretary of state be responsible publish health statistic this include datum on sexually transmit infection which be publish by sexual orientation and sex however a footnote state that woman be define in the dataset as woman and tran woman which do somewhat undermine the value of the datum what will the secretary of state do to ensure that datum be not just collect properly but publish and present in a way that be most clinically useful 
 the shadow minister raise a good example of how conflation of sex and gender identity be not helpful both in term of datum analysis and of recognise health inequality it be also not helpful in make sure that we understand variance between people base on their different background and characteristic and that we provide target personalised and effective healthcare that deal with healthcare inequality that be why we be carefully study the recommendation make by professor sullivan with a view to make sure that we be meet the need of everyone include the trans community who i understand not least because of the way that the debate have be conduct in recent year be anxious about the implication of the report however i genuinely think that the report will lead to well more inclusive and fair outcome for everyone include the trans community 
 what step his department be take to improve cancer care   in the west of england 
 i know the hon member be acutely aware of the impact that cancer can have on family we be committed to catch cancer early and treat it fast we have achieve our manifesto pledge of extra appointment month early and we have invest in more surgical hub long open time which have benefit community diagnostic centre in the south west and new radiotherapy machine the national cancer plan will also seek to improve every aspect of cancer care to improve patient outcome and experience across the country include in the west of england 
 i thank the minister for her answer the big space cancer appeal be run by the cheltenham and gloucester hospitals charity be go on in my constituency it be have to raise £ for a new cancer centre at cheltenham general hospital which be a regional cancer centre because the previous government   do not fund it i be proud of the fund raise work that be be do by the hospital charity include by my caseworker mateusz who be run half marathon for the cause will the minister meet i and dr sam guglani and dr charles candish to discuss how the government might provide more support for this crucial piece of infrastructure 
 i commend the hon member ’s campaign activity for improved cancer facility i commend too mateusz ’s half marathon i wonder when the hon member will be do his half marathon but i can guarantee that i will not be join he the fact that this sort of activity be take place be fantastic local provision for healthcare be manage by the local health system i would be delighted to meet he and local representative as soon as diary allow 
 cancer care be important for people right across the uk particularly early diagnosis how do the government plan to raise cancer awareness among young people during teenage and young adult cancer awareness month and ensure that they be fully aware of the sign and symptom 
 this be a really important issue we have reinstate the child and young people cancer taskforce which i visit a couple of week ago we have task it with ensure that child and young people be a part of its work the department will be mark teenage and young adult cancer awareness month appropriately we encourage all child and young people to get the check that they need and be aware of cancer symptom 
 what step his department be take to help tackle inequality in nursing career progression 
 i know that this subject be very close to my hon friend ’s heart after many year of nhs service ensure great career for nhs staff include nurse have be a key theme of our engagement with staff to shape the year plan i will shortly set out further measure to improve progression for nurse and their colleague in other key nhs profession 
 i thank the minister for her answer nurse across the profession be increasingly take on complex role and responsibility yet many do not have access to high pay band that reflect these change and there be too much variation around the country as well as look at this will the minister ask the department of health and social care to implement a consistent model for support structured progression from band to band for early career nurse base on the completion of key competency and the acquisition of necessary experience 
 my hon friend be right that nhs staff include nurse should be pay appropriately for the work they be ask to do and will be ask to do in future we be work with the nhs staff council to ensure that the national job evaluation scheme be implement fairly and consistently across nursing and all profession 
 my constituent ben have spend decade work as a nurse he tell i that his paramedic and midwife colleague receive automatic pay band increase post qualification while he and his nursing peer do not ben and his hard work nursing colleague have miss out on ten of thousand of pound compare to colleague in other discipline do the minister agree that something must be do urgently to make up for this inequity 
 i be absolutely clear that we need to make sure that the job evaluation scheme look at staff across the piece and that people be reward appropriately for the work they be ask to do we will do that as part of our discussion with the nhs staff council and we will be work consistently with staff as part of the year plan to ensure that people be reward we depend on these staff and we want to encourage they to be part of the nhs workforce that be the approach we intend to take 
 what step his department be take to reduce the number of people wait for nhs treatment 
 the week standard for elective care have not be meet for almost a decade that be the legacy of the conservative party our plan for change commit we to cut waiting list from month to week by the end of this parliament through a combination of investment and reform since we take office the waiting list have reduce by over we achieve our manifesto pledge of extra appointment month early and waiting list have fall month in a row a lot do but a lot more to do change have begin and the good be still to come 
 i welcome that nhs waiting list for physical health have fall for the last month in a row and that nhs waiting list be down by almost since labour be elect but with people who have mental health condition time as likely to have to wait month for treatment what step be the government take to ensure that we see the same progress in waiting time for both mental and physical health treatment can they deliver a parity of esteem that the opposition fail to achieve in their year in power 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question and for his long stand commitment to improve mental health service lord darzi highlight that those wait over a year for mental healthcare outnumber the entire population of leicester we be committed to tackle this we will fix the broken system by recruit an extra mental health worker introduce access to a specialist in every school and roll out community young futures hub in england we will shortly be publish before parliament our mental health investment standard report which will show that when it come to mental health this government be put their money where their mouth be 
 wait time for patient live in the village of burton outside christchurch could be drastically cut if the local integrate care board be to approve the creation of a new branch surgery that application have be outstanding for more than month will the secretary of state put a bomb under dorset icb and get it to approve it straight away 
 that sound like an invitation to commit a criminal offence and i think i will resist the temptation i be sure that the icb have hear the hon gentleman ’s forceful representation and we will make inquiry to get he an update 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 shrewsbury and telford hospital trust have some of the long waiting list in the country for cancer and a&e among other area it have be receive national mandate support from nhs england ’s recovery support programme nhs england also provide support to hospital trust that be struggle with excessive waiting list through its get it right time programme give the announcement to abolish nhs england will the secretary of state reassure my constituent that there will be continue support for hospital trust such as shrewsbury and telford with unacceptable waiting time and a clear pathway to improvement for patient who deserve well 
 yes be the short answer remove the duplication waste and efficiency that come with have head office for the nhs will lead to well more effective and streamlined decision making but that will not in any way detract from the support that the hon member describe in fact we should see more support and crucially more investment go to the frontline as a result of the saving efficiency and improvement that we be make 
 what recent progress his department have make on implement the hub and speak model for community pharmacy 
 this government recognise the vital role that community pharmacy play as an integral part of our health system and local community we be work with community pharmacy england on the pharmacy contract which will start to stabilise the sector and make it fit for the future and we will announce the outcome very shortly on hub and speak dispense we intend to lay draft secondary legislation in the come week to come into force later this year 
 community pharmacy funding be at a critical juncture with many pharmacy in my constituency face financial challenge with run cost increase and uncertainty around the date of the upcoming settlement community pharmacy be concerned that there may be disruption to their business what step be the department take to ensure that input from community pharmacy be consider and prior to any further legislative or regulatory change relate to the hub and speak model 
 my hon friend be right that we inherit a community pharmacy system that have be neglect for far too long such that over the past year on average pharmacy have be close every week a wide range of community pharmacy and representative organisation feed into the public consultation on hub and speak reform and i be pleased to confirm that their response be overwhelmingly positive in support of model of hub and speak which we will be go with 
 i recently visit well pharmacy in northallerton which like so many other play an important role in provide community health service value service be the provision of free blood pressure check to those over the age of will the minister to join i in urge anyone with health worry or a family history of high blood pressure to take advantage of this fantastic free pharmacy lead preventive community health service 
 the right hon gentleman be right that a big part of the government ’s shift from hospital to community be the pivotal role that community pharmacy will play in that process we be commit to the pharmacy model of enable community pharmacy to do more clinical work such as the type that he just describe that be at the heart of our year plan 
 i call the shadow minister 
 now that the secretary of state be abolish nhs england will he listen to the call from the national pharmacy association and the independent pharmacies association and publish immediately the independent report commission by nhs england on pharmacy finance 
 we will publish the economic analysis imminently he mention the national pharmacy association which give i the opportunity to say that i think that the collective action that it be take be premature unnecessary and detrimental to community pharmacy patient i urge the npa to reconsider its position and wait for the outcome of our negotiation with the cpe which will come very shortly we will announce that very soon 
 the national pharmacy association which have be wait for month to get the answer be advise all its pharmacy member to reduce service and hour for the time in year that have never happen before under a labour government or under the lib dems or the conservatives but it be happen under this government its chair say 
 the sense of anger among pharmacy owner have be intensify exponentially by the budget 
 cite unfunded national insurance contribution and national living wage increase the minister acknowledge that there be potential action what contingency plan do the department have to ensure that we keep patient safe if pharmacy close their door in industrial action next week 
 on the npa it have take we a while to clean up the utter mess that we inherit in community pharmacy that involve agree financial envelope and get into negotiation with cpe those negotiation   have be constructive and i be delighted to confirm again that we will soon announce the outcome of those negotiation what we see here be the shadow minister apparently take the side of people take collective action in a premature way that be detrimental to patient they would be well off wait for the outcome the government be take industrial relation into the century as oppose to the performative nonsense that we see for year 
 what step he be take to support family of patient who have be section under the mental health act 
 when someone be detain family involvement be extremely valuable and family should be support to maintain contact with their love one our mental health bill will strengthen requirement to involve family in people ’s care we will require clinician to involve patient and their family where possible when develop new statutory care and treatment plan 
 i have ongoing constituency case with adult man who have serious and long term mental health issue of my constituent believe that her life be in danger because of her son ’s threaten behaviour towards she her own mental health have be seriously affect by the fear and stress the other case involve a young man cause serious distress to his neighbour with his behaviour which recently lead to an incident where he reportedly threaten a police officer with a knife both man be live alone in unsupported accommodation both be at risk of coercion and abuse because of their mental health problem and both be cause serious distress to their family and neighbour will the minister tell the house whether he be work with other departments to ensure the availability of more provision to support people such as my constituent to live safely in the community and not cause harm or distress to those around they 
 i know that the hon member have meet my right hon friend the secretary of state about at least of those constituency case nhs england have ask mental health trust to review the care of high risk patient and have publish national guidance on the standard of care that be expect ultimately the mental health act be there to protect people and provide the necessary power to enable clinician to manage and support such patient and to do so where possible in the community 
 yesterday i meet essex partnership university nhs foundation trust and speak to it about the need to support the family of those suffer with mental health issue in harlow and particularly those with caring responsibility will the minister consider how mental health service can well identify and support young carer 
 my hon friend will be aware that we be bring forward the mental health bill and an important part of that legislation will enable family   member when they be choose as a nominate person to have power to request assessment under the act challenge decision and request consideration of discharge in line with the near relative power 
 what step he be take to ensure special educational and disability need be meet by the nhs

 i welcome the move to streamline decision making and improve efficiency in the context of the secretary of state ’s nhs england announcement if he genuinely drive decentralisation to integrate care board however in a write answer on   march the minister for secondary care say 
 we recognise there may be some short term upfront cost as we undertake the integration of nhs england and the department

 i be sure that the whole house will want to send our condolence to the right hon gentleman follow the loss of his father it be good to see he back in action if not always back in action 
 give the scale of the job reduction and saving that we be seek to make the total quantum will be determine once the final shape of the organisation be determine 
 can i also welcome as i do in january the secretary of state ’s commitment to seek to work cross party on the future of social care he be right and i welcome that at the time but like he and many   other we be all keen to see progress can he update the house on when he anticipate the cross party talk that be postpone in february will be reschedule to take place 
 baroness casey will be make contact with all party group in order to set date with party across this house very shortly and of course she will be kick off her commission in april which be now only day away 
 it have be brilliant to meet resident who in recent week have have their operation date bring forward thank to the additional evening and weekend appointment that the labour government have fund but we know that too many people be still wait too long what more will minister be do to really drive down waiting list in my community and across the country 
 as my hon friend say we have bring nhs waiting list down month in a row include during the peak winter pressure we have deliver the more appointment we promise month early and we publish our elective reform plan at the beginning of the new year with the prime minister which set out the combination of measure the investment and the reform that will ensure that we deliver the short waiting time and the fast access to treatment that my hon friend ’s constituent and people right across the country deserve i look forward to keep he update 
 we be not go to get everyone in unless we pick up the pace the liberal democrat spokesperson will set a good example 
 in last night ’s panorama programme the secretary of state be report to have say that he do not need to wait for a review to put more money into social care which we agree with if that be the case will he explain why the casey commission will take year and will he instead commit to get it do this year in order to fix the social care crisis straightaway 
 phase of the casey commission report next year and the final casey report be due by but the chancellor have already announce an increase in funding for social care in the budget through mean that the hon lady ’s party regrettably seem to oppose 
 it be impossible not to be inspire by my constituent hayley and the bravery of her daughter lily after lily be diagnose with an optic pathway glioma at the age of just hayley step back from work not just to look after lily but to make sure she be able to campaign for change the government ’s commitment to a national cancer plan be welcome but with brain tumour not typically be stag or screenable how can we ensure that they be not overlook as part of the plan ’s development 
 i commend my hon friend ’s constituent for her work with the brain tumour charity and i wish lily well with her treatment the government have launch the brain tumour research consortium which will support effort to speed up the diagnosis of tumour and aid the recovery of patient and the national cancer plan will ensure that we include brain tumour patient we know that everyone ’s cancer be as unique as they be and this will be reflect in the plan 
 in review the nhs workforce plan will ministers urgently review the pay and status of register nurse who be after all the backbone of the nhs many be now dependent on food bank thousand be saddle with student debt and most will expect never to rise beyond band which be a maximum of £ a year 
 the chancellor take almost immediate action to deliver the uplift in pay for nhs staff that they deserve we be work closely with the royal college of nursing unison and other ensure that we tackle the challenge of low pay in the nursing profession that the hon member describe 
 since be elect i have be contact by a number of constituent register with a gp in scotland who find themselves unable to get medication for which they have a prescription while visit england will my hon friend take step to encourage nhs england and nhs scotland to work together to find a solution that work for patient 
 i be very sorry to hear about my hon friend ’s constituent experience access vital medicine while travel between nation should be seamless and i will ask nhs england to work with nhs scotland to well understand what need to change to make thing easy for patient across the uk 
 in the light of the recently announce staffing reduction across integrate care board have the secretary of state make any assessment of how those cut to the cambridgeshire and peterborough icb will delay the delivery of essential new primary care service for my rapidly grow constituency particularly in northstowe cambourne and st neots where thousand of constituent be already face unacceptable difficulty in access care 
 despite the significant uplift announce by the chancellor at the budget system financial return during the planning round suggest an overspend for the come year of between £ to £ when i say i would not tolerate overspend in the nhs i mean it when i say i would go after unnecessary administrative cost duplication and bureaucracy i mean it that be what this government be do to protect frontline service 
 in saxmundham in my constituency dr havard have lead a campaign for year to transform the healthcare centre into a stop community healthcare hub his    practice have already expand service transform health locally do the minister agree that the saxmundham healthcare hub be an excellent example and model for what this government be try to do to transform community healthcare 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that shift care from hospital to the community be at the heart of our year plan i would be happy to meet the doctor lead this pilot to find out more about the excellent work that she describe 
 for year i have see how a young constituent have be able to completely control his previously life threaten seizure with medicinal cannabis but at huge cost to his family a cost that be prohibitive for other people will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can make access to such treatment more affordable accessible and safe so that we can help more people 
 we recently have a helpful debate in westminster hall on this topic we be do more research on this issue to ensure that the evidence base be there i be happy to discuss the matter far with the hon member 
 in the ongoing discussion on assist dying point on which we all agree in this house be the urgent need to improve palliative care i therefore welcome the government ’s recent £ commitment to support hospice include those that help my constituent can the minister confirm whether long term funding for hospice will be a priority in the upcoming year health service plan 
 my hon friend be right that the hospice sector have be provide with the large capital spend in a generation—£100 we be also provide £ of revenue funding to child and young people ’s hospice i can confirm that hospice will play a key role in our shift from hospital to the community as he set out in his question 
 tragically ed be just year old when he decide to take his own life and that be why the family have join we today in the gallery what urgent action be the government take to improve mental healthcare and suicide prevention for young people like ed

 an early day motion from note that woman be typically wait year to be diagnose with endometriosis shockingly nearly year later that wait have increase to year the government be right to tackle the appalling waiting list for surgery but the in woman who suffer with endometriosis often struggle with year of pain before surgery be even suggest what plan do the department have to deal with these delay and how we can ensure that those work in primary care recognise this debilitate condition early 
 those statistic be shocking campaign here and elsewhere have help to raise awareness of endometriosis the update to national institute for health and care excellence guideline will help as will more appointment and our commitment to the week target training for gps be now part of the core curriculum and we expect that to yield good result nhs england and the office for national statistics have look across to the statistic on diagnostic metric standard i be happy to update my hon friend outside the chamber and i know other member be also interested in how we be deliver on these commitment 
 my constituent in south west hertfordshire remain concerned about the significant delay to the redevelopment of watford general with the chancellor already bring a emergency budget before the house tomorrow and with care home hospice and charity face unsustainable pressure from this government ’s national insurance increase what reassurance can the minister give my constituent that the labour party truly care about healthcare rather than score political point 
 the irony there be big difference between what this government be do and what the conservative party do for year which be that this government will actually deliver a new watford general hospital where the conservative party fail 
 do minister agree that a logical conclusion of the darzi report be that the national care service that we be commit to create must be free at the point of use as lord darzi find as long as the social care system remain mean test and the nhs be a universally free service unmet care need will continue to put unsustainable pressure on our health service 
 that be a vital issue the casey commission will look at how good to create a fair and affordable adult social care system and at which structural reform will be need where health and social care meet because reform must always be marry with investment 
 general practitioner in my constituency have consistently restructure over year of constant systemic and economic pressure how will the minister convince the treasury to exempt gps from the increase to national insurance contribution and show my gps that he have their back 
 it be thank to the decision take by the chancellor in the budget that we be able to award £ for general practice that be why the minister for care be able to get the gp contract agree for the time since the pandemic opposition member can not continue to welcome the investment and oppose the mean they have to spell out where they would cut service or raise taxis instead 
 last year my constituent danielle be diagnose with pots postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome she find herself unable to get out of bed and unable to speak for long period she   could not receive care in scotland specialist treatment do not seem to exist for pots what more can we do for people like danielle and what conversation have the minister have with counterpart about establish specialist treatment in scotland 
 in england it be the responsibility of local integrate care board to work with clinician service user and patient group to develop service and care pathway that be convenient and meet the need of patient with pots nice have publish a clinical knowledge summary on the clinical management of blackout and syncope which provide advice for uk clinician on good practice and the assessment and diagnosis of pots 
 i have twice invite ministers to visit bridlington district hospital with i to see its much underutilise potential in the light of the ongoing challenge face by coastal and rural health service and the newly announce change to integrate care board may i hope that it will be time lucky and extend that invitation once again 
 we be delighted to receive the hon gentleman ’s representation we will look carefully at the case he make and will consider visit as diary allow 
 much to my alarm the north central london icb have recommend the closure of the maternity unit at the royal free hospital in my constituency the secretary of state know the royal free well will he meet i to see how i can save my local maternity unit which look after i so well when i have gestational diabete 
 these local service be so important for local woman as my hon friend have experience it be really important that reconfiguration be discuss with local member of parliament represent their constituent this be obviously a matter for the local icb but i be happy to discuss it far with she 
 follow my long run campaign i be grateful to the government for finally update the outdated treasury rule that be prevent local health board from spend more money on keep city centre gp location will the government now issue guidance to local health board and nhs trust to accelerate the pooling of resource so that we can get more service out of hospital and on to our high street especially as our high street need extra footfall right now 
 i be grateful to the hon member for all the work she have be do on this issue she be right we need more integration of service and we need to look at where we can share facility to achieve well care for patient and well value for taxpayer

 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise these serious issue there be issue of concern here and she clearly describe a concern situation for the local community we need to look carefully at what be happen and the minister of state for health my hon friend   the member for bristol south karin smyth would be delighted to meet she

 we be always look for opportunity to unblock more capacity and i would be happy to meet the right hon gentleman 
 coastal constituency such as mine in bournemouth east suffer significant health inequality what be the government do to address they and will the minister meet i and coastal labour mps to address the issue 
 my hon friend be right coastal community face unique challenge when it come to health inequality i will shortly attend the all party group for coastal community where i will meet he and colleague to discuss these issue 
 as the secretary of state will know in this house allocate £ of funding in memory of dame tessa jowell who be kill by a brain tumour year on less than half of that money have be spend the money be do no   good sitting in a bank so will the secretary of state please commit to spend that money within a decade of dame tessa ’s death 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question as it give i the chance to pay tribute to the late great baroness jowell as well as to the work take place in her name through the tessa jowell brain cancer mission there have be frustrating delay in get fund out the door for the purpose for which it be intend minister be look carefully at this issue and we want to make more progress more quickly to ensure that family do not receive the same death sentence that our late friend do 
 that conclude question time 
 on a point of order mr speaker since   january i have table name day write parliamentary question to the department of health and social care have receive a hold response mean that just be answer on time to give a simple example i ask how many time the minister have meet community pharmacy england day later i receive a standard hold answer which state that 
 it will not be possible to answer this question within the usual time period 
 it then take day for an answer to come which state 
 minister meet regularly with external stakeholder on a variety of topic include but not limit to pharmacy 
 may i ask your advice mr speaker what mechanism be in place to ensure that name day question be answer on time if they continue not to be answer on time how can i escalate the matter far 
 i be disappointed that question be not be answer but i be not responsible for ministerial answer i hope that those on the treasury bench include the secretary of state have take on board the importance of reply name day question be call that because they be mean to be answer on the day that be name i be very disappointed the department may be overwork if that be the case perhaps we ought to bring in staff from other departments to ensure that question be answer on time i know that the secretary of state will have immediately make a note to ensure that those question be answer 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement on asylum hotel and illegal immigrant cross the channel 
 as the right hon member be aware the home office discharge its statutory duty to provide accommodation and to support destitute asylum seeker through asylum accommodation and support service contract those contract be enter into by the previous government commence in and be split between provider clearsprings ready homes ltd serco ltd and mears ltd. 
 significant element of the behaviour and performance of of the sub contractor of clearsprings ready homes fall short of what we would expect from a government supplier that be why the home office have inform clearsprings ready homes that it must exit the arrangement with a subcontractor in its supply chain stay belvedere hotels we will not hesitate to take further action in respect of clearsprings and its wide supply chain if that prove necessary and we be conduct a full audit of our supply chain 
 we expect the high standard from those contract to provide essential service and this government will always hold they to account for delivery performance and value for money where there be concern about how contractor or their subcontractor be discharge their contractual obligation we will not hesitate to take swift and decisive action 
 the home office progress matter relate to these contract with its provider in commercial confidentiality i will not give a running commentary but i assure the house that whatever the position with any of its provider the home office remain focused on maintain continuity of service and ensure that our statutory obligation be meet at all time and have contingency plan in this regard none of that take away from our commitment to reduce the huge cost of asylum hotel which remain our priority 
 in relation to channel crossing this government have put forward a serious credible plan to restore order to our asylum system include tough enforcement power ramp up return to their high level for more than half a decade and a major crackdown on illegal working to end the false promise of job use by gang to sell space on boat increase law enforcement action and disruption be already show some indication of pressure on the business model of the gang and we be introduce new power for law enforcement to use against the vile trade in people smuggle and trafficking 
 last summer the government be elect on a promise to end the use of asylum hotel well it have now be month so let we see how they be get on the use of asylum hotel have go up by since the general election it have not go down it have go up some mainly illegal immigrant be now in those hotel cost hard work taxpayer around £ a year it be completely unacceptable that taxpayer be ask to foot a bill that size the   people live in those hotel break our law by come here from france which be a manifestly safe country that nobody need to leave i have a very simple question for the minister when will the government end the use of asylum hotel 
 during the election campaign last summer and subsequently the government also promise to smash the gang but that promise now lie in tatter in the month since the election people nearly people have illegally cross the english channel which be a increase on the same period month before in fact be even bad since   january more people have cross the english channel illegally than in any year in history this be the bad year it be bad than the previous bad year so thing be get bad not well they have not smash the gang but capitulate to they 
 the hon lady mention return most of those return do not relate to people who arrive by small boat in fact those people be return who come by small boat amount to only about of small boat arrival i do not know how let of people who arrive by small boat stay here be a deterrent 
 at the weekend we see briefing to the press and not to parliament mr speaker that the government be now consider some kind of offshore removal scheme that sound vaguely familiar at last they have realise that some kind of removal deterrent be need will the minister now apologise for cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start and as a consequence lose control of our border 
 i will not take any lesson from the shadow minister in his last month as immigration minister nearly people cross the channel in small boat but he be complain about half that level of crossing happen in the past month neither will i take any lesson from someone who serve in a government who preside over a situation where at its height there be people in more than hotel we be get a grip on the problem by start up asylum processing once more but we inherit a huge backlog there be a fall in asylum processing in the run up to the general election with more than people stick without be process in the asylum system we be get a grip of that but by definition the backlog and chaos that the conservatives leave we be take time 
 do the minister share my astonishment at the shadow home secretary ’s argument give that the conservatives waste ten of million of pound on accommodation that could not be use and billion on hotel the state of the asylum system that we inherit be unbelievable will the minister commit to reform that seriously dysfunctional system include scrutinise asylum contract with the provider when the break clause come up next year 
 we inherit a system in chaos and a series of asylum contract worth billion of pound that be year long with a break clause in so we be look seriously at what we can do to get well value for public money in those contract the action on stay belvedere hotels ltd be example of the work we be do to drive well value in the   contract that we inherit we will not tolerate the behaviour of subcontractor or contractor who do not provide good value for money which be why we have insist that clearsprings ready home remove stay belvedere hotels ltd from its supply chain 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be a pleasure to be back in the chamber to hear the shadow home secretary ’s great hit of conservative failure from the last parliament whether it be cut to neighbourhood policing or the woeful handling of the asylum system under the previous government in which he be a home office minister of course the home office should ensure that all asylum accommodation provider deliver value for money safety and security but tinker with contract will not change the fact that asylum hotel be a lose lose they eat up taxpayer money and leave local council and community to sort out the mess 
 to pick date at random the share of asylum application that receive an initial decision within month fall from in the quarter of to just towards the end of the last government ’s time in office when do the minister think that the processing of application will speed up so that the backlog will come down community such as mine will get the use of their hotel back and those grant refugee status can integrate and contribute to our economy 
 i certainly agree with the hon lady that the shadow home secretary sound like a broken record we be well used to he run that argument in this place i also agree that the key to deal with hotel be to get the system back up and run from the chaos that it be in i can tell the hon lady that asylum processing at decision have ramp up considerably and we be get through the backlog we inherit but there be also a huge backlog by definition in the appeal system partly cause by the legacy appeal the dash to end the legacy system ahead of the fantasy rwanda scheme beginning which have lead to a big backlog in appeal we be look to see what we can do about that because it be important that we get a fast and fair system from end to end and that include appeal 
 because the previous government lose complete control of our border the leyland hotel in my constituency of south ribble be close down year ago yes year ago and use for asylum seeker there be a chronic undersupply of hotel in south ribble chorley preston and central lancashire can ministers provide any indication at all of when the hotel will cease to be use as an asylum hotel i be ask that question every single week 
 i want to get out of hotel as quickly as be feasible i will not name particular date because that be a pointless thing to do we have to get through the appeal system and the asylum processing system so that we can move people through the system much more quickly we also need to continue our work on ramp up return which have see a huge increase the high figure for the last year and we intend to continue with that process 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 the medium be report that the early the contract can be break be september next year can the minister confirm whether that be the case what liability do the taxpayer have for a contract end today that we can not get out of until september next year 
 the right hon lady be talk about the prime contractor which in this case be clearsprings ready home as with the other contractor the break clause be with it we have approval or not of sub prime contractor stay belvedere hotels ltd be a sub prime contractor and as the home office we have withdraw our approval for it to be in the supply chain 
 the shadow home secretary have a nerve to come to this house and make that argument when we in the community see the damage that the contract he manage do to the public purse shall we revisit some of those great hit his contract put council and clearsprings against each other push up price and make it impossible for local community to help those house there he cause absolute chaos 
 i have in my hand of the letter that the hon gentleman ’s government be present to people who be refugee give they less than day notice of where they be be move mean that school place have to be hastily reorganise and child have to be hastily re clothed because of the decision he make on public fund absolutely no saving be make in the way in which he manage the contract 
 will my hon friend make a commitment and a pledge to all of we who have have to deal with clearsprings and its chaotic management that when she have the opportunity to renegotiate the contract or possibly even break it for good she will put public value for money and not repeat the chaos of the shadow home secretary 
 we be do all that we can with the exist contract to drive value for money and we be also look to pilot some other potential alternative to supply 
 i call the father of the house 
 under the refugee convention we can automatically deport illegal migrant who come here but under the european convention on human right we can not i have a probe new clause move on my behalf in committee on this subject and with your permission mr speaker i hope to move it again on report i know that the minister can not answer absolutely now but will she look at that new clause in a constructive spirit surely we can all agree that we do not want criminal enter this country illegally 
 i certainly agree with the father of the house on that subject we have a small but perfectly form debate albeit in his absence on his new clause and i look forward to debate it with he on report of the border security asylum and immigration bill 
 i think i still have the large number of asylum seeker in hotel in the country with more than and i have experience of clearsprings and stay belvedere it would be really helpful if the new contractual arrangement involve full consultation with some of the organisation work at the frontline of support asylum seeker so that some of the lesson can be learn about past performance to improve future performance 
 i be more than happy to meet with the right hon gentleman to talk about his experience on the ground with respect to both stay belvedere hotels ltd and clearsprings ready homes 
 i hope i be not the only person here who be utterly depressed by the complete lack of compassion show by the shadow home secretary and the lack of recognition that the people we be talk about have story of their own and have experience horror that we can barely even imagine be it not right that we look at this in a more thoughtful way to reduce cost to the taxpayer and help those who will be successful asylum seeker to integrate would it not be wise to allow people who be asylum seeker to work after be here for month 
 those asylum seeker who have not have their claim process within a year through no fault of their own be allow access to work i be unconvinced that allow access to work early would do anything other than create more demand for people to come here 
 it be widely accept across the whole country include in my constituency that the conservatives leave we with open border with people cross on their watch and the opening of asylum hotel cost our taxpayer £ per day this government have already establish border security command and have deport people that be record number up from what the opposition could achieve we be also bring in counter terror power to take on the smuggling gang do the minister agree that the opposition need to get behind our bill so that those counter terror power can empower the national crime agency to take out the smuggling gang 
 my hon friend be correct that the border security asylum and immigration bill which have be through committee and be await its report stage will create counter terror style power that will help we prevent some of these crossing and disrupt the sophisticated criminal smuggling gang that be allow to take hold across the channel unabate by the conservative party it will enable we to tackle this problem at source by work across border with colleague in other country tackle the people smuggle route as well as the gang 
 when in opposition the labour party talk tough about what it would do when it enter government as my right hon friend the shadow home secretary have say though small boat arrival and hotel use be both up and asylum seeker be be wave through the system just to make the minister ’s number look good this all   reek of arrogance and complacency and we be now see the real world impact for example wethersfield in my constituency have see the number of asylum seeker user go up while labour talk tough before the election it take thing off the statute book before it replace they with anything else so when will the minister actually come to the house with serious proposal to reduce the number of small boat arrival which have go up by over on her government ’s watch 
 the right hon gentleman say that wethersfield be now get more people but it be still not hold the number that his government plan for it to hold when it be open so that be rather an odd argument for he to make if he be serious about reduce the problem at our border i would have think that he would want to support the counter terrorism style power in the border security asylum and immigration bill but it seem that he be not 
 under this government illegal workplace raid and arrest be up by a while that be welcome we all know from our high street and constituency that there be still a way to go so can the minister confirm that we will continue at pace on this trajectory to send a clear message that the uk will not tolerate people abuse the asylum system or indeed illegal activity in any form 
 yes of course we have to crack down on abuse of our asylum system but also on the exploitation of vulnerable and desperate people by vicious criminal gang 
 during committee proceeding on the border security asylum and immigration bill i say to the minister that it would only be a matter of time before the government concoct some sort of rwanda style deportation scheme even i do not think that it would come so quickly if weekend press report be to be believe can the minister say that those report be totally not true and will she now rule out ever implement a country deportation scheme like the introduce by the conservatives 
 i be not go to comment on leak 
 i welcome the decision to close napier barrack in my constituency where there have be long stand concern about condition among other issue what assurance can the minister give my constituent as well as those be hold there that this site will be operate properly until it close in september 
 if my hon and learn friend want to talk to i about any of the detail i would be happy to listen but of course we want to operate that site properly and appropriately until we hand it back to the ministry of defence in september 
 give that the government do not believe in send illegal immigrant to country such as rwanda can the minister explain how they plan to deport people who have destroy   their document so that we do not know their country of origin or be the solution to keep those people here forever in hotel or in of the home that labour plan to build 
 mr deputy speaker sorry mr speaker i do not know why i be call you mr deputy speaker today i have go back a very long time to when you be but that be so long ago that i can scarcely remember it my apology mr speaker 
 the right hon lady should remember that the rwanda scheme be about deport people for good not deal with their asylum claim that be not in any way what this government would ever consider do which be why that scheme be cancel 
 the shadow home secretary can complain all he want but while he be in the home office people cross the channel with thousand house in hundred of hotel across the country a fail rwanda scheme and a complete freeze on asylum decision making be the reason that the cost of hotel rise to £ a day everything stop just to send volunteer to rwanda and the shadow home secretary be responsible for the chaos do my hon friend agree that the only party in this house that vote for the border security asylum and immigration bill will be the party that sort this chaos out 
 i agree with my hon friend 
 we all want to stop the perilous channel crossing that be cost vulnerable people their life so what step be the government now take to boost further co operation with europol so that we can smash the gang that be profit from misfortune 
 we have put more resource into europol to co operate with european partner across border operationally we be work across europe we have a new agreement with the german government and an agreement on sanction and illicit finance with the italian government and the calais group have meet in london we be do a lot of work with source area and country such as vietnam not only on return but on counter some of the advert that tell lie about the kind of life that await those who get on perilous small boat we be work with our international colleague across the piece both diplomatically and operationally to try to put pressure on the international criminal gang and begin to close down this evil trade 
 under the conservative party the asylum budget balloon to over £ take of our overseas development assistance for in country refugee cost mainly hotel against an oecd average of make we a big outlier internationally i welcome the commitment to speed up processing and reduce hotel use but with the aid budget be reduce to from can the minister reassure i that an ever increase chunk of a small aid budget will not be spend in country instead of on support vital poverty alleviation work internationally 
 it be clearly important that overseas development money be use to try to prevent the flow of people that have be the result of collapse in various country we in the home office will do all we can to minimise the spend that we currently take from the overseas development aid budget 
 mr speaker you will know that most of the illegal cross channel migrant who come to this country come through my constituency at the processing centre in manston as such i have take a particular interest in this subject what i have to say be certainly not go to be popular either among conservative members or among labour members but neither be it go to be populist the home secretary and i not together both visit the calais area recently we see there hundred if not thousand of very determined very desperate people who be go to risk their life to cross the channel the conservatives rwanda scheme and this government ’s much vaunted smashing of the gang will not solve that problem there be no quick fix and the only solution will be long term and international in that context do the minister believe that cut overseas aid be go to do anything other than worsen the problem 
 i suggest that the right hon gentleman raise that issue with the chancellor 
 it beggar belief that the conservatives have the gall to question the action we have take as a government in clear up the mess they leave behind because they simply stop do anything other than waste £ of taxpayer money we have return people with no right to be here we have increase border force and we have increase work with our european ally and our intelligence service but there be more to do it be a mess and people in our country feel let down and a deep mistrust of politician that be cause division and rumour mill to develop and fester in our community can the minister tell i what we be do as a government to rebuild public trust and community cohesion do she agree that that should start right here in this house 
 i believe that people need to think about the language they use and the impression of human being they give when they talk about this very emotive issue it raise huge concern i know as a government we have certainly get to do all we can to try to reassure people that we can get this system back under control after find a chaotic mess when we come into government 
 i recently write to the minister to request the estimate saving the government expect from the closure of asylum seeker hotel in response i be inform that while the home office publish datum on the number of people house in hotel it do not report on the number of room occupy a hotel accommodate people in share room incur significantly different cost from where individual occupy separate room yet that critical distinction be overlook give that effective policy decision must be base on clear evidence will   the minister commit to publishing room occupancy datum to ensure accountability and informed decision making 
 i will write to the hon gentleman 
 i can assure asylum seeker that they will be treat with kindness and compassion in my human right city of york however tragically a mother at full term lose her baby at a hotel will the minister give a guarantee that pregnant woman will not be move from hotel to hotel so that they can have continuity of service and a safe pregnancy 
 that certainly should not be happen if my hon friend want to talk to i about it i will try to see what happen in that instance 
 a directive from the treasury report in the times appear to suggest that house building by the government will help with the backlog of asylum seeker stay in hotel do the minister believe that individual who have arrive in the uk illegally should be give access to social housing ahead of british citizen 
 no 
 back in the conservatives when in government tell the town of blackpool that they would use the metropole hotel as an asylum hotel for month they lose control of the border and drive the asylum system into chaos and we be still pay the price now in of the most deprived community in the country do the minister agree that we need to close these hotel as soon as possible and give back that prime real estate especially in coastal community such as blackpool to help the tourism industry thrive 
 we do not believe that it be sustainable to keep hotel use indefinitely and we be work to close hotel 
 small boat crossing be up since the general election the number of illegal asylum seeker in the asylum hotel in my constituency of broxbourne be also up illegal asylum seeker be be prioritise for gp appointment and school place which be outrageous to i and my hard work constituent can the minister tell the house when she will meet her manifesto commitment of close the asylum hotel in my constituency of broxbourne 
 our aim be to close asylum hotel and get out of what we feel be an unsustainable situation as quickly as practicable 
 i be sure that the minister agree that of the root cause of this crisis be the last government ’s politically motivated action slow down and then freeze the processing of asylum application i have asylum seeker wait or more year for a decision the british public want to see a contribution by asylum seeker to the system reduce the public burden on   taxpayer so have the minister consider lift the ban on work so that people wait more than month for a decision can contribute to our tax system until a decision be make 
 asylum seeker who wait long than a year be allow to work so long as that wait have not be cause by they that is a wait through no fault of their own we have that system now and i be not consider shorten the length of time that must elapse before work be allow 
 rise 
 order question be get considerably long can we keep they on point 
 like   the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale i have visit calais on a number of occasion and i have meet people there who be desperate they be victim of war human right abuse environmental degradation and sheer poverty and desperation they do not cross the channel without a reason to do it what conversation be the minister have with those in european country north africa and the middle east about the root cause of the huge number of people globally who be seek asylum at the present time inhumanity and deportation will not work 
 i do not apologise for deport people who have no right to be here or who have be through the system and be discover neither to be asylum seeker nor to have any right to stay in the country i accept the right hon gentleman ’s point about the desperate situation that people be in they could claim asylum in the country they be in and we need to work with our counterpart in the european union and along all the route to see what we can do to divert those people who be seek a well life in our country and see if we can look after they close to home 
 under this labour government illegal work raid and arrest be up by a do the minister agree that that send a clear message that the uk will not and should not tolerate those who abuse our immigration system and that we will crack down on illegal activity in all its form
