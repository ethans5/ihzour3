on friday the bbc interview an egyptian economic migrant in calais who say that he have try and fail time to cross the channel but since the prime minister ’s agreement with president macron he be give up 
 i do not want to go to britain any more because they be make it much hard for we every time we try they deflate our boat and remove the engine if they make it even hard i ’ll stop try 
 do that not prove that this new deal to send migrant back to france can be a genuine deterrent unlike the last government ’s pathetic attempt to claim credit 
 i be grateful to have secure today ’s adjournment debate on an issue that affect community across the country the condition of our road although i will focus on the situation in cheshire and in my constituency of chester south and eddisbury and on what i believe be a failure by local authority to get to grip with the issue i will begin by set the context and reflect on the broad systemic problem with how we repair and maintain our road network 
 the public accounts committee recently publish a report on the condition and maintenance of local road in england it show that this problem be widespread that the department for transport do not have a good grasp of the real condition of local road in england and that fund arrangement to local authority be likely to be push they to focus spending on short term reactive work in my view this reactive rather than proactive approach to road maintenance in cheshire urgently need to change instead of neglect route be identify and tackle particularly in rural area we see a pattern of piecemeal catch up on individual pothole rather than long term cost effective repair that offer real value for money 
 at fletton quays in my constituency manage by gateway properties leasehold resident be report that service charge have increase by as much as in the last year flat be under warranty and fault should be fix by western homes which build the property but instead be be fix by gateway which have increase the service charge and i understand have even be send separate bill on top i know that the government have be keen to address issue relate to high service charge and the need for financial transparency for leaseholder can the secretary of state provide an update on that work 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she be take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she be take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she be take to reform the leasehold system 
 may i start by send my thought and prayer to everyone involve in yesterday ’s incident at southend airport 
 we remain committed to give leaseholder great right power and protection in respect of their home and bring the feudal leasehold system to an end we have make significant progress implement the leasehold and freehold reform act and this month launch a consultation to strengthen leaseholder protection when it come to charge and service we be deliver but we will go far we will publish a draft leasehold and commonhold bill later this year this week the high court will hear challenge to some of the enfranchisement reform in the act we will defend those challenge robustly and will await the court ’s judgment 
 i have be contact by more than resident in peterborough about problem relate to firstport ’s leasehold and management service charge they face unfair charge a lack of transparency bad communication and poor service resident in for example hammonds drive and manor drive be feed up with get a class service what be my right hon friend do to help resident in place like peterborough get the peace of mind and justice that they so deserve 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue many member from across the house have find that too many leaseholder suffer as a result of poor quality service from manage agent we be consult on proposal to strengthen the regulation of manage agent include a proposal to make minimum professional qualification mandatory 
 my constituent ed a leaseholder in monument court stevenage have be trap for year in an unsellable flat after the building fail its ews1 assessment because higgins homes have not follow its own architectural plan he have face uncapped and unregulated service charge and utility billing and the threat of disconnection while see the saleable value of his property decrease by more than £ will the secretary of state consider introduce a statutory route through which people like ed can pursue legal action against a developer without bear the full cost burden 
 i be very sorry to hear about ed ’s situation the building safety act protect qualify leaseholder from uncapped cost relate to non cladding remediation when remediation be not progress leaseholder can apply to the tribunal for remediation order which can compel relevant landlord to fix relevant defect in their building as well as for remediation contribution order which require developer to pay towards the cost of the remediation 
 at fletton quays in my constituency manage by gateway properties leasehold resident be report that service charge have increase by as much as in the last year flat be under warranty and fault should be fix by weston homes which build the property but instead be be fix by gateway which have increase the service charge and i understand have even be send separate bill on top i know that the government have be keen to address issue relate to high service charge and the need for financial transparency for leaseholder can the secretary of state provide an update on that work 
 unjustified service charge be wholly unacceptable and i strongly recommend that the homeowner obtain legal advice the leasehold advisory service for instance give free legal advice to leaseholder developer be typically responsible for rectify defect within the year of the warranty period even if no warranty claim be make developer be still liable and should not pass charge on to leaseholder unreasonable service charge may be challenge at the tier tribunal 
 through the government ’s landmark renters rights bill we be do much to address the inequity of the rental sector for constituent in bracknell and across the country for instance we be extend the right to request a pet now the government be turn our attention to reform leasehold my right hon friend will know that many leaseholder be also block from have a pet by a clause in their head lease what can we do to deal with that 
 i know that my hon friend have already speak to the minister for housing and planning about this issue and that those discussion will continue as you well know mr speaker pet bring joy happiness and comfort to their owner while also support their mental and physical wellbeing we have strengthen the right of private tenant to keep pet in the renters rights bill and we will of course keep the position of leaseholder with pet under review 
 leasehold resident of marlborough house in maidenhead find that their developer have enter liquidation leave £ in section payment outstanding as well as massive defect in the development leaseholder fear that the authority will ask they for the section money and that the cost of finish the development will fall on their shoulder give that some developer have poor track record with dozen of company go into liquidation how can we strengthen leasehold legislation to ensure that future leaseholder do not have the same problem as those in marlborough house 
 it be frustrating when we hear of situation like this which be why it be our intention to publish the draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill in the half of this year i hope the hon member will contribute his view on it so that we can build on the proposal that the previous government bring forward they need extra work as i mention in my opening answer but hopefully we can start to deal with this issue so that leaseholder get the protection that they deserve 
 at a recent surgery a constituent bring to i the leasehold problem that she be experience with her housing association despite pay a considerable amount in service charge leaseholder have be whack with a £ bill for improvement to the property ’s roof with the expectation that they will pay within day of completion there be limited consultation and leaseholder have no choice in who carry out the work what do the secretary of state advise my constituent to do 
 again the consultation exercise that we be undertake be about how we deal with such matter i hope the hon member will work with we during the consultation period so that we can bring forward the draft legislation and get this matter right we hear these story time and again and we need to fix this problem and protect leaseholder 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer the issue with the leasehold system and the need for legal protection for everyone have be set out in debate in westminster hall and this chamber and i very much welcome the government ’s commitment to change the leasehold system here be slightly different from that in northern ireland but the legal protection need to be the same i have a very simple question for the secretary of state will she have discussion with the relevant minister in northern ireland to ensure that what happen here can happen for we in northern ireland and that we will be give the same protection 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right we do work with the devolved nation not just to show they what we be do but to learn from they we have see that the housing situation be not an england only situation the issue affect the whole of the uk and we all need to learn from each other hopefully the reform that we be bring through will be inform by the devolved nation but we will also have some learning for they we need to work together in lockstep to protect people wherever they be in the united kingdom 
 what step her department be take to help support housing association in the timely remediation of unsafe property 
 in june we announce over £ of investment to accelerate clad remediation by give social landlord the same access to government remediation scheme as   that afford to private building owner we will shortly publish revised guideline on how to access the funding and a joint plan with social landlord and regulator in order to accelerate remediation and improve resident experience 
 may i thank the minister and his department for push forward awaab ’s law it can not come soon enough especially the hour deadline for deal with mould and damp and especially for my constituent yasmin who have be live in an unacceptable situation with very young child for year however i have real concern about how ready housing association be to implement the regulation which be come in very soon in october i have raise this issue with the national housing federation but what assessment have the minister make of housing association ability to fully comply with all the regulation under awaab ’s law by october so that we can ensure that all my constituent can live in a safe and healthy environment 
 of all may i say how sorry i be to hear that my hon friend ’s constituent yasmin have be live in those condition for so long we have publish draft guidance for social landlord to make sure that they understand the requirement under awaab ’s law as my hon friend would expect we be work very closely with they to support their operational readiness we take a phased approach but we be encourage social landlord to act now they should raise any concern with we now so that we can consider how to well support they in the meantime they must meet their exist legal obligation 
 on the importance of enforce awaab ’s law there be home in my constituency that be damp mouldy and publicly own but not by housing association they be own by the hospital trust and include accommodation for nurse and their family can the minister clarify the remit of this law and the extent of his power and control in this area will he urge all public sector landlord to make sure that they comply with awaab ’s law so that our nurse can bring up their family in place that be safe clean and decent 
 i do not think it be any secret that i the deputy prime minister and the housing minister be very hard on all our partner include the public sector in order to make sure that they do their job the hon gentleman raise a very important concern and the housing minister will write to he on it 
 what step her department be take to increase housing delivery 
 the government ’s plan for change include a hugely ambitious target of build new home in england in this parliament in the month we have be in office we have take decisive step to boost housing supply include overhaul the national planning policy framework and introduce the planning and infrastructure bill which will far streamline the delivery of new home as well as critical infrastructure 
 it be welcome to once again have a government who believe in house building i thank the minister for his comment when i speak to house builder of the issue they raise with i be the performance of the building safety regulator shovel ready project that have planning permission be delay at gateway and check that should take a matter of week be take month if not year what be the department do to manage the performance of the regulator ensure it have the resource it need and hold it to account so that we get spade in the ground as soon as possible 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the operation of the building safety regulator which while essential to uphold building safety standard be cause delay in handle application for building project and be have an impact on new supply in london i hope he will take comfort not only from the £ the government allocate to the bsr in february but from the target package of reform we announce last month include the establishment of a new fast track process to reduce delay and strengthen leadership and governance 
 the government promise to increase housing delivery through grey belt not green belt development grey belt be describe as 
 poor quality land car park and wasteland 
 however since the new guidance be publish hertsmere have be inundate with application that simply seek to rebrand green belt as grey belt the lack of clarity and the inconsistent application of the rule mean that such application be hard to resist will the minister provide great clarity and tighten the rule before large swathe of radlett bushey shenley potters bar and borehamwood succumb to urban sprawl 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that question he cite the planning practice guidance we have issue which have a very clear definition of the grey belt and the rule for it when it come to plan making local authority must take a sequential approach on decision making for application outside of local plan he will know that we have impose very strict law to ensure viability assessment be not use on those site where development come forward and be judge to be appropriate by decision maker and by the planning inspectorate in appeal those golden rule will also ensure high level of affordable housing infrastructure and access to green space 
 i welcome the government ’s bold and ambitious plan to deliver more housing especially affordable and social home in wandsworth the council be already deliver home but of the home in its plan only be accessible for wheelchair how will the government deliver more accessible home and will the minister agree to raise the default standard to the m4(2 standard of accessibility and adaptation so that everybody have the opportunity to live in a safe and accessible home 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point i have a vague memory of certain parliamentary question ask much the same and i refer she to those   answer we want to ensure that all people have accessible home we be consider the m4(2 standard and we will make announcement in due course about the accessibility of new home in general 
 when the minister have meet major house builder what have they tell he about the chance of hit the government ’s target of build new house in this parliament 
 those house builder have express their confidence and their gratitude for the reform that the government have carry out it be slightly peevish of the right hon lady who stand for election on a manifesto that commit her party to home to say that our home target be unachievable we quite regularly hear from conservative members that we be concrete over every inch of england but at the same time that we can not meet our target we will meet that target of home 
 i call the shadow minister 
 lord know who the housing minister be talk to because time and again developer have say that he can not achieve his target of home as he know i have severe doubt about his ability to meet such unrealistic housing target and i suspect the opposition will be prove right however if he do succeed the quality of new home must be maintain will he do what the new homes quality board be call for and ensure mandatory board membership for developer of all shape and size and an empower ombudsman so that home occupier be protect 
 i thank the shadow minister for that question he be absolutely right that our target of new home which be extremely stretch we have never say anything other than that do not entail unit at any cost the design and quality of new home and new place be incredibly important he rightly cite the new home code of practice and we be give consideration in the round to whether that can be strengthen for example whether it need to be put on a statutory footing in general we want to drive up the quality of new home in the place and community we be create 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the competition and markets authority recently find that major house builder be prevent and distort competition include by match price and incentive to buyer that further damage public confidence in house buying and will have push home ownership out of the reach of many people house builder have agree to pay £ towards affordable housing scheme but what redress be available for homeowner who have be mislead how will the government achieve oversight of that funding to ensure that builder be hold accountable the additional home be deliver and there be effective disincentive to stop this happen again 
 the hon lady draw the attention of the house to an incredibly important point the government be clear that the house building sector can thrive only when there be fair and open competition where that be find not to be the case it be right that the cma act decisively as it have do in this instance by extract £ for social and affordable housing from the house builder investigate we be take action to fix our break housing system as i have say by overhaul the planning system address our dysfunctional land market and end our over reliance on a speculative model of development that produce sub optimal outcome and constrain housing supply if she have evidence of any individual be directly affect in the purchase of their home i would be very grateful if she could bring it to my attention 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of reduction in council tax revenue from student house in multiple occupation on local authority 
 the government believe it be right that student be disregard for council tax if the only resident of a household be full time student the dwelling will be exempt in the recently publish fair funding review the government propose to fully account for the impact of student exemption in the distribution of the settlement 
 in my bath council receive £ through the revenue support grant this year it be just around £ student who be exempt from council tax be not be count will the minister ensure that through the fair funding review the issue be urgently address and that council such as bath and north east somerset be not miss out entirely on central government support 
 the fair funding review will do what it say on the tin it will make sure that for the time ever all component pressure that council face in deliver public service and in raise money locally be take into account it be wrong that while this parliament can decide on national exemption that council have to apply which limit their ability to raise council tax locally we do not account for that in the distribution of funding that follow for the time we will do that 
 liverpool be a university city and i have university in my constituency liverpool city council be estimate to lose £ in council tax revenue each year due to student exemption will the minister explain when and how those anomaly will be deal with so that the council do not lose that amount of funding every year 
 the fair funding review be out to consultation we welcome contribution to the consultation from member local authority and other at heart we want to fully account for the ability of an area to raise income locally nationally there be student exempt dwelling and hall of residence it be quite right that we take that into account when we assess how much council tax can be raise locally in some city and town that will make quite a material difference 
 what step her department be take to increase funding for homelessness prevention service 
 what step her department be take with local council to prevent homelessness 
 the government have increase funding for homelessness service by £ bring the total to nearly £ the spending review protect that level of investment until and provide £ of additional funding from the transformation fund 
 the number of people in the uk who have no recourse to public fund have increase significantly in recent year lot of those people end up fall through the crack in the system some of they perhaps end up rough sleeping and some engage in antisocial behaviour but the thing they all have in common be that they do not have the support need to regularise their lifestyle and there be not the enforcement that be need to remove they from their situation will the minister outline the step be take to ensure that people with no recourse to public fund be not leave in a bureaucratic limbo which help nobody 
 it be important that migrant come to the uk should be able to maintain and accommodate themselves without recourse to public fund we encourage council to exhaust all option when work with people with restricted eligibility for public fund the funding for the rough sleeping prevention and recovery grant can be use to help anyone provide action be within the law 
 london borough now spend £ a day on temporary accommodation while cost and rough sleeping have soar central government subsidy have be freeze for year push council to the brink of bankruptcy do my hon friend on the front bench agree that it be time to lift the tory cap so that london council can get the support they need to make homelessness history 
 the department for work and pensions keep the level of housing benefit subsidy for temporary accommodation under review and any future decision will be inform by the government ’s wide housing ambition include tackle homelessness and the broad fiscal context our fair funding review consultation set out our proposal to target money where it be most need and will account for temporary accommodation cost 
 homelessness be a huge issue in my constituency where housing cost be among the high in the country and people can not find social and affordable housing the business rate reset propose under the fair funding review would potentially lead to a decrease in the net resource available to the council can the minister   assure those live in the cherwell district council area that the fair funding review will include protect support for tackle homelessness 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that we inherit a homelessness crisis with record level of people in temporary accommodation rough sleeping have go up by since the previous labour government cut homelessness and rough sleeping dramatically we be invest to tackle the root cause of homelessness and i look forward to work with the hon gentleman on those issue 
 i call the shadow minister 
 recent figure provide by chain report a record people sleep rough in london a increase in the year since this government take office and a increase since sadiq khan take office as mayor of london what conversation have the minister have with the mayor of london to tackle this failure in leadership and will she commit to eliminate rough sleeping by the end of this parliament after a year of this government it have go up 
 i gently remind the shadow minister that rough sleeping have go up by since and that it be cut by third by the previous labour government 
 what about this 
 why do the hon gentleman not apologise for his party ’s record of year of failure we be take action to tackle the root cause of rough sleeping and homelessness he should apologise for the failure of his government 
 what step she plan to take to help to increase participation in uk election 
 this government be commit to increase participation in our democracy we will give and year old the right to vote in all election give they a say in shape their future where we find barrier to participation we will work with the electoral sector and other stakeholder to tackle they 
 i recently have the pleasure of get a robust grilling from some and year old from aquinas form college in my constituency which leave i fill with optimism and a real sense that our democracy be in good hand my worry though be that these former and young people like they might lose their enthusiasm for our democracy and for voting because they feel that our past the post voting system lead to politician take a majority of power on a minority of vote with more than of mp elect with under of the vote cast in their constituency do the minister agree with her own government ’s statement on why they be scrap past the post for mayoral and police and crime commissioner election and should we expect a different voting system when the aquinas former vote at the next general election 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question her party have the opportunity when in government to introduce electoral reform this government be focus on ensure that young people be enfranchised i look forward to work with she to deliver vote at for young people in our country 
 i recently visit some wonderfully politically engage former at sir frederick gibberd college in harlow include luka and finlay who shadow some of my office staff last week do the minister agree that give and year old the vote will help to build a lifelong habit of democratic engagement and participation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the evidence show that when young people participate in politic it positively affect they through their lifetime and increase participation young people can pay tax and join the army at so it be right that they should have a say in how our country be govern 
 what step her department be take to ensure that area with high level of deprivation receive adequate funding 
 what step her department be take to ensure that area with high level of deprivation receive adequate funding 
 we be committed to improve how we assess need to ensure that central government funding be distribute fairly to the place that need it most we begin at the last settlement with the £ recovery grant and subject to the fair funding review consultation our propose reform mean that the most relatively deprive place will see large increase in income than the least deprived place 
 newcastle under lyme be at the heart of our industrial heartland in community such as silverdale knutton and cross heath we see high level of health inequality and low level of life expectancy than in many wealthy area these community be let down by those who go before we and be leave behind will the minister meet i to discuss how good to support industrial community like mine in newcastle under lyme so that we can finally tackle this entrenched inequality 
 my hon friend make a very fair point there be aspect to this we must make sure that place get the investment they need to realise their full potential we be work on that with our plan for community which the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris   be engage in but that have to be build on fair funding at the base of what the local authority do there be nothing fair at all about the   previous government impoverish council in the most deprived community send many to the wire we be put that right 
 i be grateful to the minister who have name barnsley ’s local authority in the £ plan for neighbourhood the spending review have confirm neighbourhood level investment for deprive community however chapeltown and high green in my constituency have community in the bottom nationally in the index of multiple deprivation while dodworth have a community within the bottom nationally these area would benefit significantly from neighbourhood level investment to build a sense of pride in place for my constituent will the minister consider include these community among the area that be yet to be announce 
 i be sure that the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend the member for nottingham north and kimberley have hear those diligent representation it be true that many part of our country have talent and potential that be not be meet by opportunity this fund be about make sure that every area have seed investment to begin to rebuild support by fair funding for the local authority we can not underestimate the effect of the year of constant hit and attack from the previous government there be a reason why many community have the resilience to stand up for themselves regardless of all that the power of their unity finally they now have a government on their side 
 it be often hard to see because it be more sparsely spread across large rural area but i remind the minister of what i know he know deprivation exist in our rural area can i urge he to ensure that this do not become an issue of north versus south or urban versus rural but that the government use taxis to address deprivation wherever and whenever it arise include in my constituency 
 i thank the former minister for those representation on the point about fair funding and unpicking where money be need there be a lot of commonality on this issue in the chamber we absolutely accept that in rural area the cost of service delivery be high in some case such as for refuse collection and adult social care it be common sense that if people have to travel far to pick up bin or make a home care visit it will cost more money as a result 
 however that be not the only thing we need to take into account we must take into account deprivation and the ability of a council to raise money at a local level daytime visitor number be also a factor where a council be not get a tax take from those visitor but there be a public service take on the other side importantly we must consider the ability of a local authority to raise tax at a local level to meet the demand it be the government ’s job to act as an equaliser in the system 
 it be absolutely right that funding follow need but may i gently urge the minister to look at how the propose new funding formula for local authority affect borough across london give that it do not consider housing cost which we know be the big driver of poverty and deprivation in london 
 we be in a consultation now so we be willing and ready to hear representation but many people i be not accuse the hon member of this have jump to conclusion base on headline that be not support by the evidence when we track where money ultimately go all the matter that she rightly say need to be take into account be take into account in the consultation we have include the cost of temporary accommodation in the base formula for the time ever so she will find that outer london borough in particular will benefit from that so far they have be underappreciated for the cost of that pressure 
 what plan she have to increase community involvement in the planning process 
 what plan she have to increase community involvement in the planning process 
 the government strongly encourage broad community engagement in the planning process and we want to see great public participation in the development of local plan in particular we be currently explore new way to increase and enhance community engagement in the planning process include by improve access to planning datum through its digitisation 
 i be sure the minister agree it be vital that local resident concern be properly listen to especially on major planning decision have listen to many constituent in place such as new deer kintore and rothienorman who be face huge amount of energy infrastructure i table an amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill that would have create a statutory duty of consultation for infrastructure in scotland in committee the minister argue against it and say that the scottish government ’s discretionary power be satisfactory will he please explain why the government believe that a discretionary power which my constituent fear will simply be ignore provide meaningful engagement while the statutory right that i propose would not 
 i can do no well than to draw the hon lady ’s attention to the extensive remark that i make in the bill committee 
 in towcester when the dhl development be go through planning more than resident submit objection to the council thousand sign petition i speak on their behalf as their mp against the plan and locally elect councillor vote to against it at the strategic planning committee meeting but it be ultimately approve on appeal resident naturally be lose faith in engage in the system the minister refer in a write question to there be a more democratic plan lead system take in large number of voice in our case how many more resident would need to be involve to have an impact 
 i think that the hon lady if i follow her argument be speak about objection lodge to an individual planning application we be make no change to that process resident all over   the country will still be able to object to any planning application that come forward we be make sensible change to improve the certainty and speed at which planning decision will be take with a tier approach a consultation be live at the moment to which she can offer input but when it come to local plan which be a slightly separate issue we be look to encourage great participation upstream local plan be the good mean by which local community can shape the development come forward in their area 
 in hartlepool the tees valley mayor ’s development corporation have remove planning power for large swathe of the town from all democratic control in turn much of the planning function have be outsource to a private company with no connection to hartlepool which be rule out any community involvement will the minister look at curb the power of development corporation so that planning remain in the hand of democratically elect politician 
 i note my hon friend ’s concern in relation to the tees valley in general we be look to streamline the power give to development corporation we take measure in the planning and infrastructure bill to allow they for example to shape transport in area but if he want to write to i or ministers to raise more of the specific of that case we would be more than happy to take a look 
 i call the shadow minister 
 community support be always vital for development and with of planning application already decide by official under delegate power it be clear that that democratic voice can be miss can the minister tell the house why take that in tandem with the devolution white paper which envisage abolish around of councillor who represent their local resident on plan committee in england local community do not deserve more of a say rather than less in the planning process 
 we do want local community to have more of a say particularly when it come to the development of local plan which be as i have say the good mean for local community to shape development in their area when it come to the national scheme of delegation which be the point the hon gentleman be really drive at he know that as thing stand every local authority across the country have its own scheme of delegation there be a huge amount of variation there there be good practice and bad practice and as we debate at great length in the bill committee we think there be a strong case for a national scheme of delegation to improve certainty and the speed of planning decision he be more than welcome to respond to the consultation that be live at present 
 what discussion she have have with local authority in scotland on community regeneration funding 
 we be commit to invest across all nation and be deliver regeneration funding to many community across scotland include the hon gentleman ’s i have meet representative of the convention of scottish local authorities which speak for scottish authority on a couple of occasion and i really value its partnership and insight 
 the £ community regeneration partnership with comhairle nan eilean siar the western isles council will help develop the marine economy of vatersay and barra the cultural heritage of eriskay and north uist and the spinal route through the island it put islander in the drive seat use the muscle of the uk government do the minister agree that this be a template for other uk government departments and their relationship with scottish council and do it not stand in contrast with the game of throne be play by the scottish national party government who hoard decision making and money in edinburgh 
 i note the passion with which my hon friend speak about this his leadership be go to be crucial to the success of this project it speak exactly to why we have take the approach we be take we need local community in charge they be the expert on their life and on what they need and they should be in the driving seat that be why we will work with they on this project and through our plan set out in the spending review we will put that at the heart of everything we do 
 what step she be take to support high street 
 we be commit to rejuvenate our high street and town centre that include tackle empty shop through high street rental auction and legislate for a community right to buy to protect precious asset that be set out in the spending review provide funding to up to place to help community drive forward the change they want to see in their area 
 i hear what the minister be say but our high street be under enormous pressure because of labour ’s job tax and cut to business rate relief as good tax pay shop shut down they be be replace by dodgy front business to fight that in my constituency havering trading standard last week seize £ worth of illicit good from shop in upminster through a collaboration between the council the public the police and i as the mp this vital work be at risk because the government be plan to shift council grant money away from the capital and up to place in the north of england can the minister assure i that labour be not in the mayor of london ’s word plan to level down the capital by threaten resource for council here 
 i can not accept the hon lady ’s characterisation if we look at the history of the to government we can see that the pressure on local authority which we have hear about from across the house be so great that we see trading standard wither on the vine across the country in many place they be down to single individual never mind number in single figure we be clear that we be rebuild local government and hopefully we will see lot more brilliant enforcement like we have see in havering 
 not far from here on whitehall and on oxford street we have see the proliferation of harry potter shop these be not welcome for our tourist and we do not believe that they be trade fairly will the minister support i in encourage his majesty ’s revenue and customs to work with westminster city council which be do great work in shut these shop down to ensure that we create space for thrive high street business 
 i entirely share my hon friend ’s view we want to see thrive high street we want to see full shop but we want to see they trade fairly properly and in a quality way work well with their staff and be a good part of the community when that be not happen it be really important that action be take she raise some high profile example and we of course stand ready to support local authority in whatever way we can 
 what step she be take to build more social and affordable home 
 we announce a record £ investment into the new social and affordable home programme at the spending review which will create around new home over year early this month we publish a step plan that set out how we will deliver the big increase in social housing in a generation to transform the safety and quality of social housing my priority as deputy prime minister be to get more social rent home build and that be what this labour government be deliver 
 planning authority such as rugby borough council be work hard to ensure that new housing development contain as much affordable and social housing as possible they work in partnership with housing developer government body such as homes england and other to that end though it be not always an easy process and it often take far too long will my right hon friend outline how the planning and infrastructure bill will enhance their work so that we can build as many high quality affordable and social home as possible and ensure that more people particularly young people get the home they deserve 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that the planning and infrastructure bill will unlock a new scale of housing and infrastructure delivery across all tenure to help build home in this parliament we be also take action in the bill to improve local decision making by modernise planning   committee and ensure that planning department be well resource by allow local planning authority to set their own planning fee 
 will the deputy prime minister please explain why her government will not set a target for the provision of social housing while i welcome the investment in the social and affordable home programme that she set out the reality be that it will meet only of the total number of new home anticipate and only of the current demand for social housing if she believe that set national target like the home target be important to drive change why will she not set a target for social housing 
 the government have not set an affordable housing target to date but we continue to keep the matter under review accurately try to forecast long term delivery be inherently challenging but we believe that our new social and affordable home programme could deliver around social and affordable home over its lifetime with around for social rent the measure we have take alongside the commitment for rent so that there be this long term programme will hopefully help with the supply and i have make it categorically clear to the sector that we want more social rent housing 
 i call the shadow minister 
 there have be a reduction in new affordable housing start in london under mayor khan and i note that hillingdon labour vigorously oppose the conservative council ’s plan for a new affordable housing site at otterfield road in yiewsley will the secretary of state condemn the failing of these labour politician on housing and will she acknowledge that whether someone be a homeless person a rough sleeper or an aspirational time buyer this government be fail those in housing need 
 i find that absolutely astonishing when the conservatives fail to meet their housing target year after year the mayor of london have welcome the money through the affordable home programme there be the amount of money we have give and we be permit to increase rent by cpi plus we be consult on rent conversion when the conservatives prevent social landlord from be able to raise the money to provide the social housing that we desperately need we be make the change to get social housing where they fail miserably 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of allow local authority to end the right to buy in their area 
 the government do not intend to abolish the right to buy either nationally or by give local area discretion to do so we want to ensure that council tenant who have live in and pay rent on their social   home for many year can retain the opportunity to own their home we be however progress fundamental reform of the scheme to well protect much need social housing stock boost council capacity and ensure that more social home be build than lose 
 my somerset councillor colleague have for decade steadfastly protect and manage our stock of council house which have decline through right to buy from ten of thousand a number of year ago to only now while i welcome the recent attention to this issue by the deputy prime minister and the minister be it not time that community decide for themselves whether to sell off council house at all 
 although i respect the hon gentleman and his view we have a principled difference of opinion on this matter as i have make clear the government ’s consider view be that long stand council tenant should be able to buy the home that they have live in for many year i hope however that the right to buy reform that we have make and announce today reduce maximum cash discount allow council to retain of receipt and exempt newly build social home from the right to buy for year will create a fair and more sustainable scheme 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be pleased that the english devolution and community empowerment bill have its reading last thursday that landmark bill will bring a radical reset to local government deliver on our manifesto commitment to decentralise power ignite regional growth with streamlined power for mayor and speed up new home and infrastructure it will empower community to take back control of their beloved pub and shop help local leader to deliver a decade of national renewal as promise in the plan for change 
 i and my liberal democrat colleague welcome the provision in the english devolution and community empowerment bill which recognise that past the post be an unrepresentative electoral system that be a welcome step although we would prefer alternative voting for mayoral election but if the government admit that past the post be not suitable for mayoral election why do they maintain that it be suitable for general election 
 let i cover that point mayor serve many million of people and manage multimillion pound budget yet can be elect by just a fraction of the vote under the previous government ’s change despite the fact that the supplementary vote system have work effectively for over a decade give that the large population that mayor and police and crime commissioner represent far exceed those represent by parliamentarian we think that this be the right approach 
 despite decade of hard work not least by the birnbeck regeneration trust the restoration of weston super mare ’s nationally important birnbeck pier be now at risk after the royal national lifeboat institution pull out leave a £ shortfall will the minister outline how the government might support the project and will he meet i urgently to discuss next step to restore that vital part of my town ’s soul 
 i recognise the effort of the birnbeck regeneration trust my hon friend be a doughty campaigner for his community we announce support for community at the spending review and further detail will follow but i would be delighted to meet he to speak about birnbeck in particular 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the chair of the work group on anti muslin hatred islamophobia dominic grieve who be appoint by the secretary of state have previously state a preference for a definition of islamophobia that would shut down talk of religion in case like the grooming gang scandal all other member of that committee again appoint by the secretary of state be adherent of the muslim faith do the secretary of state not share our concern that their report and recommendation will be see as predetermine and bias 
 no i do not there be no blasphemy law in this country because the previous labour government get rid of it whereas the conservative party have keep it on the statute book for year we will always protect free speech include the right to criticise religion that kind of incendiary language be beneath the shadow secretary of state 
 incendiary language i be merely state the fact that be the reality the right hon lady be right in regard freedom of speech be on the line the current position be that the report will be for government eye only and that the decision on a definition will be take in private will she at least commit to make the full report publicly available so that it can be scrutinise in the house and elsewhere before a decision be take 
 as set out in the term of reference the independent working group will submit its finding to ministers we will then consider its recommendation and set out the next step i urge member to let the independent group get on with its work if the shadow secretary of state have view he should feed they in as part of the call for evidence 
 resident in part of east cleveland be rightly sick of unscrupulous landlord dump individual with serious criminal history in our village will the department support my call for the council to introduce selective licensing in the area and what further support can the secretary of state offer to help we take back control of our village 
 the government support selective licensing as a tool to tackle the impact of poor housing management on local community the general approval that we grant in december give council full power to introduce scheme regardless of their size my hon friend ’s own authority will have hear loud and clear his call for it to consider do so 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson

 it be incumbent on all of we to park with a degree of responsibility particularly at peak time i think parking relate issue be the no feature of my mailbag our consultation on private parking open last friday i be interested in work with the hon lady and all member to ensure that we get the balance right 
 many people from the women and equalities committee to the miscarriage association and myleene klass have fight for miscarriage bereavement leave similarly can n’t buy my silence and my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh call for a ban on non disclosure agreement thank to the deputy prime minister ’s cross departmental role these protection will be deliver by labour how and when will they come into force 
 i be incredibly proud that the government be introduce life change measure that will make a real difference when people be at their most vulnerable i personally thank my hon friend for courageously tell her own story and i thank my right hon friend   the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh   for her incredible and tenacious campaigning their work will change the life of so many we want to bring the benefit of these vital measure to people as soon as possible we will be consult on they in the come month prior to commencement 
 home ownership feel increasingly out of reach for many time buyer particularly for young family who want to remain in the beautiful scottish borders what can the government do to ensure that house builder deliver more affordable family sized home in all part of the united kingdom so that local people have the chance to own their home in the community where they be bring up 
 the hon gentleman will know that housing be a devolved matter when it come to affordability we be take step not only to boost   housing supply significantly as i have set out but to ensure that more time buyer can get access not least through the permanent mortgage guarantee scheme on which the chancellor will add more detail in her mansion house speech this week 
 the   late evidence show that the gap between average wage and rent in my constituency of poole be of the wide in the country can the minister explain how we will ensure that the new home that we build will be truly affordable and not subject to excessive rent increase 
 my hon friend will have note the £ allocate at the spending review to our new year social and affordable home programme which as the deputy prime minister have make clear we think will deliver about affordable home over its lifetime with about for social rent he will also know that our renters rights bill include provision that will empower tenant to challenge unreasonable rent increase

 a yes will do 
 if the hon lady write to i about the issue i will certainly respond to she 
 resident in heather gardens and kett ’s meadow in hethersett have see a hike in fee from the residential management group supposedly for playground that be fence off and just dust what action will the government be take to stop these rip off practice and support my resident in south norfolk 
 my hon friend raise a matter that i know be of concern to hon member across the house it be precisely to protect residential freeholder in hethersett and other freehold estate across the country from unfair charge that we will consult in the near future on how we implement the consumer protection provision in the leasehold and freehold reform act relate to the payment of estate management charge 
 on that note many of my constituent live on new freehold development such as mortimer park in driffield would like to see resident be give the power to strip those unaccountable estate management firm of their responsibility for share space and let the local authority adopt that land be it the government ’s intention to legislate to make that possible 
 the hon gentleman draw the house ’s attention to an important point about freehold estate and i direct his attention to the report by the competition and markets authority on the matter if he want to read far there be a problem here too many amenity and infrastructure be not be deliver to common adoptable standard and therefore many local authority rightly say that they do not expect to pick up the tab for bring those amenity up to the relevant standard and then maintain they we have get to tackle both issue as we look to end the prevalence of these freehold estate arrangement go forward 
 in suffolk coastal the housing crisis be no less severe than in other rural area across the country and my constituent be keen that future development build in for nature will the minister comment on what plan the government have to ensure that we build in for nature and specifically on the prospect of and appetite for support for swift brick 
 although swift brick coverage be increase we want to drive up swift brick installation as i make clear on report of the planning and infrastructure bill we be consider use a new sweep of national policy for decision making to require swift brick to be incorporate into new building unless there be compelling reason that preclude their use or would make they ineffective 
 will the minister outline what new planning power could be provide to local council to ensure that my local community in broxbourne can say no to house in multiple occupation hmos where they be not want 
 the hon gentleman who i have great affection for as we go through our tenure be a highly experienced former councillor and he will know that local authority already have article power if he have evidence that those power be not prove effective i would really like to have more information 
 in the light of the government ’s determination to bring prosperity to coalfield community like doncaster do the minister share my desire for the fast delivery of the coalfields regeneration trust industrial project it be also important to transfer any potential fund directly to the crt so as not to delay any delivery with bureaucratic process and bidding 
 the government be commit to invest in coalfield community and i be pleased to meet my hon friend and mayor ros jones to talk about their exciting plan in doncaster which we be invest in we be look very closely at what the coalfields regeneration trust have send we the trust be of course a great legacy of the previous labour government and we be commit to work with it 
 my constituent ryan from carpenders park write i with concern about the lack of community space especially alongside the government ’s housing target   will the minister reassure the house that the government will ensure there be community space to support any new housing development 
 i say thing to the hon gentleman he will forgive i if he know this already but we do strengthen the provision for infrastructure in our recent change to the national planning policy framework beyond that we want to strengthen the exist system for developer contribution where infrastructure and affordable housing come through planning agreement so that local authority can extract more public gain from that process 
 cayton a village in my constituency could now become home to new home through the government ’s new home accelerator to ensure the success of that project it be essential that we deliver the appropriate infrastructure such as gp service proper drainage and road all of which have not accompany previous development what step be the minister take to develop a coastal strategy to ensure that new development for coastal village like cayton be deliver alongside infrastructure 
 the government take a similar interest in coastal community as local growth minister i work closely with coastal authority and have a significant eye on coastal community we want to strengthen the system of developer contribution to make sure that the new development provide that infrastructure with further detail to come the change in the national planning policy framework mention by the minister for housing and planning will support increase provision and modernisation of infrastructure with regard to the south of cayton the new home accelerator be support the delivery of home

 the hon gentleman will know that it be labour council that be lead the charge at a local level to regenerate local community and invest in local business the evidence be there they be support by the plan for community and the community right to buy there be a real effort in this area he do not give prior notice of his intention to raise the particular issue that he mention but if he want to follow up in writing we will certainly look into it 
 i call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee 
 this afternoon i visit centrepoint where i speak to young people live in self contain flat   and meet the staff who be work to support those young people the secretary of state will be aware that a coalition of charity support young people be call for a specific youth focus section in the end homelessness strategy estimate show that would save £ a year do the minister agree that it be not only morally right but economically smart to have a youth specific chapter in that new strategy 
 i commend my hon friend for her work on this really important agenda i meet representative from the youth homelessness sector at a recent roundtable we be determined to ensure that the concern and interest of young people experience homelessness be integrate into our report on end homelessness and we be work with the sector to tackle the root cause of youth homelessness 
 eastbourne ’s street be be blight by severely overgrow grass verge that attract litter antisocial behaviour and crime will the minister join i in urge conservative run east sussex county council to urgently get a grip on verge maintenance in eastbourne in order to help make our grass great again 
 the real issue for most council be that the liberal democrats do not make hay when the sun be shin in their coalition year let nobody in local government forget that the seed of the erosion of local neighbourhood service start in those coalition year when the liberal democrats more than ably abet the conservative government at the time 
 i call perran moon 
 meur ra mr speaker cornwall be desperate to access the high level of devolution but because of our national minority status cornwall can not and will not join a mayoral combine authority before this house be ask to vote on a devolution bill that discriminate against the people of cornwall will the secretary of state meet i and colleague to discuss a cornwall only devolution deal 
 my hon friend will know that for the right reason we have put a significant amount of energy and time into meet parliamentarian from across the house to discuss those local issue absolutely we will meet that will probably be the meeting that we have have with cornish mps on this issue we understand respect and be invest in the cornish identity but we also need to ensure that the devolution agenda move on at pace and that every part of england can realise its full potential i be more than happy to meet on that basis 
 a new report by crisis show that only of rental property in my area of leicester south be affordable to those on local housing allowance that be a real term cut as rent soar because the government have freeze housing benefit until will the secretary of state explain how that freeze align with the government ’s aim of   reduce homelessness and will the government urgently review the cap so that people can afford to keep a roof over their head 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my early answer this government have invest nearly £ to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping as the secretary of state have point out we be deal with the root cause of homelessness that mean invest billion of pound to ensure that some social and affordable home be create over the decade so that we can get people into the housing that be urgently need 
 last week nearly people across stafford borough be tell at short notice that homes plus of our housing association be effectively scrap the current housing waiting list it also say that nearly people no long have a housing need but it have not explain how it have come to that conclusion people be confused angry and scared do the minister agree that this be unacceptable and will he meet i to help i find a way forward for those who have be leave in limbo 
 i will happily meet my hon friend about that concern development if she could write to i with the detail in advance that would be extremely useful 
 it be my understanding that south hams district council be in an arguably more sound fiscal position than the neighbour plymouth city council what can the secretary of state say to reassure i that local government reorganisation will not mimic either a forced marriage or a bad marriage where the fiscally prudent bail out the other 
 we be now in a statutory process for local government reorganisation and devon will submit its final proposal to we by the end of november we do not want to pre empt those or say anything that will direct they but i assure the hon member that there will be a consultation on the proposal that meet the threshold and we will hear from that what local people say 
 i know that reduce deprivation be a cause close to the heart of all ministers what view do they have on the extent to which high housing cost contribute to deprivation and should be take into account when we consider fund for our local council 
 we be in the consultation period for the fair funding review until   august the issue of housing cost be take into account when we judge deprivation have be raise by member previously but i encourage all member of the house and people beyond it to submit their response to the consultation 
 can the deputy prime minister guarantee that no muslim brotherhood affiliate will participate in the consultation on the definition of islamophobia 
 we have the term of reference and we have the consultation that be go on at the moment i be not go to provide a running commentary on the work of the independent group the government have a non engagement policy with the mcb and that position have not change 
 city of york council be the lowest fund unitary authority but under the fair funding review we do not fare any well can the minister extend the consultation guideline these be complex issue will he meet our council to look at the impact of the review 
 i thank my hon friend for the work she have do to champion fair funding across local government particularly for york i absolutely understand the issue the fair funding review be mean to do thing it take into account the need the cost pressure drive local authority set against the resource which be how much local authority can raise in council tax at a local level it be the government ’s role to be the equaliser to ensure that every local authority can afford decent local service but i absolutely take into account her representation 
 in reply to an early question the planning minister say that he want to increase the number of people who engage in the preparation of local plan he will know that even if that number be double it would still be a small proportion of the local community when application be be consider local community want they to be decide and determine by local authority with minimal central input will the minister guarantee that local authority will continue to have that power 
 under our proposal in the planning and infrastructure bill for a national scheme of delegation it will still be local planning authority that make recommendation and decision as the hon gentleman will know if he look at the consultation all we propose be a tier system in which a set of minor application go to expert local planning officer a separate tier can go to a planning committee where the chair of planning and the chief planning officer decide that that be the case again i encourage the hon gentleman to respond to the consultation 
 we be see massive investment in the regeneration of derby city centre include the opening of a new entertainment venue and the reopening of our market hall which be burst with small and independent business regeneration also mean ensure that our city feel safe welcoming and inclusive will the minister tell we how the department be work with the home office to ensure that our city and town be thrive and safe 
 my hon friend be tempt a member of parliament for nottingham to say something nice about derby which be slightly challenging for my prospect when i go home on thursday i do recognise the characterisation of the exciting plan ahead for derby   and i share exactly her point on police we can have the most vibrant community possible but people will not participate unless they feel safe we be talk with the home office and i would tell my hon friend to watch this space 
 last week hurstpierpoint ’s former methodist church receive permission to be convert into flat despite the parish council register it as an asset of community value and express its sincere wish to purchase it do the minister think that the regulation for asset of community value be fit for purpose how can they be improve 
 no we do not think that the regulation be fit for purpose which be why we be plan to amend they through the bill that we publish last week 
 the new life for city building project in truro be breathe new life into empty high street building and redevelop they i would love for the minister to be able to see this for himself so will he consider come to truro and attend our growth summit on   september 
 i do not have my diary for   september   in front of i but i do owe my hon friend a visit and i will definitely make such a visit 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement about the climate and nature crisis 
 on the day that the met office publish its state of the uk climate report for the environment secretary and i want to share with the british people what we know about the scale of the crisis and explain the action that we be take in response we intend this to become an annual statement to parliament 
 let i start by set out what we know from the science accord to the world meteorological organisation the past decade have see the warm year on record globally it say that long term global warming assess by a range of method be estimate to be between ° c and ° c above pre industrial level and last year be the time we see an individual year above ° c 
 today ’s met office report show that in line with what be happen globally the uk ’s climate be get hotter and wetter with more extreme event the central england temperature series show that recent warmth have far exceed any temperature observe in at least year over the past year the number of day above ° c have double and the number of day above ° c have treble this spring be the uk ’s warm on record beat the record break last year meanwhile warm ocean and melt ice sheet have contribute to sea level around the uk rise by cm over the past decade and this be accelerate the science be unequivocal about why this be happen as the met office say this morning 
 this be not a natural variation in our climate human emission of greenhouse gas be warm the atmosphere and change the weather we experience 
 we know that climate change and nature loss be fundamentally link and contribute to each other globally we be lose specie at a much fast rate than at any other time in human history here in britain a quarter of our mammal and nearly half of our bird specie be currently at risk of extinction with bird such as starling turtle dove and grey partridge under threat the abundance of specie in england have fall by an estimate since and britain have become of the most nature deplete country in the world 
 the impact of extreme weather and nature loss be not simply a future threat to our country they be already here and have impact on our way of life we know that heavy rainfall make last year ’s harvest the bad in at least decade cost farmer hundred of million of pound accord to the environment agency more than half of our good agricultural land and over property in england be already at risk of flooding accord to the uk health security agency there be more than excess deaths—10,000 people lose their life during english heatwave between and 
 as we know from recent event rise temperature place pressure on every aspect of our national life we have see this again over the past few day with incident of wildfire from surrey to scotland disruption due to train overheating and hosepipe ban announce in yorkshire kent and sussex the climate crisis be also a   massive threat to our economy the office for budget responsibility ’s fiscal risk and sustainability report publish last week say that the damage cause by climate impact in a near-3 ° c world be forecast to cut our gdp by by the early 2070s base on current gdp that will be roughly £ 
 these be uncomfortable sobering fact and we should make no mistake we must act on the climate and nature crisis to protect our british way of life because no sector or part of our society be immune from those risk unfortunately all the evidence suggest that this be just the start of the threat we face 
 i want to acknowledge in particular the anxiety that many young people feel about these issue my candid message to they be this yes there be real reason to worry about the world they will inherit but we can do something about it every fraction of a degree of warming that we prevent and every step we take to preserve nature help to limit the severity of impact and protect our country from irreparable harm it be our generation today who have a unique opportunity to act because unlike previous generation we can see the evidence of the climate and nature crisis all around we yet we still have time to limit the bad effect the only answer be to reduce emission protect and restore nature and adapt to the impact that be now inevitable let i take those in turn 
 to those who doubt whether britain can have any impact on the pathway of global emission the lesson of history be that we can before the paris climate agreement be negotiate year ago the world be on course for 4ºc of global warming now national commitment imply 2.6ºc of global warming or below 2ºc if country meet their full climate target we remain way off track from where we need to be as a world but we in this country have help make a difference across party 
 in this house come together to pass the world ’s climate change act that be under a labour government support by lord cameron the conservative party and party across the house now thank to the power of our example nearly country have similar legislation in under baroness may the uk become the major economy to legislate for net by support by the labour party and party across this house now in part thank to the action at cop26 in glasgow include the leadership of lord sharma as cop president some of global gdp be cover by net commitment in england become the country to introduce a legal duty to halt specie decline by lead by boris johnson and support by party across the house now country be sign up to the global biodiversity framework to halt and reverse nature loss 
 the lesson be clear the choice we make as a country influence the course of global action and in do so reduce the impact of the climate and nature crisis on future generation in britain to those who say that britain can not make a difference i say you be wrong stop talk our country down british leadership matter 
 we also know that climate and nature action have huge potential upside and not just for future generation it have the potential for well life today in energy security low bill clean air good job well health and wellbeing and improve access to nature this government believe in stick to our tradition as a country of   climate and nature leadership indeed turn away now at this moment of all moment when the threat and opportunity be clear than ever would be the great dereliction of duty and betrayal of future generation 
 that be why of the government ’s mission be to achieve clean power by and to accelerate to net across the economy it be why at cop29 we announce a 1.5ºc align target for base on legislation pass under the last conservative government it be why we be drive forward on our commitment to protect of our land and sea for nature and to halt specie loss by the end of the decade it be why we make the most significant investment in clean energy climate and nature in the uk ’s history at the spending review which will drive job across the country 
 because the action we need be not just about government we be also determined to help community take climate and nature action in their own area whether that be drive the expansion of local and community own clean energy project through great british energy or support mayor and local government to accelerate action at cop30 and beyond we be determined once again to use the power of our example to work with other to uphold the objective of the paris agreement include with ambitious climate target action to accelerate the clean energy revolution and the protection of nature and forest 
 as i have say action on emission be not enough on its own we must also protect the british people from the impact that we already see and sadly the great impact that we be likely to see in the future this work lead by my right hon friend the environment secretary require action across society from home and building to critical infrastructure and our natural environment we be now deliver britain ’s large ever flood defence programme invest £ over the next decade in flood barrier and nature base solution such as wetland restoration that come alongside pioneer local nature recovery strategy with measure such as tree planting and peat restoration which deliver adaptation and nature recovery together in my department as we drive forward our plan to upgrade million of home we have consult on expand the boiler upgrade scheme to include air to air heat pump which can offer cooling as well as heating 
 however i must be candid with the house we know that this be just the beginning of the reckoning that we need on how our country need to adapt across all part of society in the year to come and this government be determined to put climate resilience at the heart of our decision making 
 we have be at our good in the house when we have work across party on these issue i want to thank   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   for introduce the climate and nature bill and my hon friend the members for sheffield hallam olivia blake and for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for our discussion early this year in the run up to that bill as well as the other co sponsor who highlight the need for today ’s statement let i also take this opportunity to pay tribute to current and former member across the house for their tireless advocacy on climate and nature 
 the safety of our citizen our natural world and the country that we pass on be not a labour cause a conservative cause or the cause of any other party it be a british cause a cause of we all and a cause that require all of we to consider our responsibility to the generation of today and the generation to come i commend this statement to the house 
 it be a rare pleasure to see the secretary of state at the dispatch box today give that he turn down the opportunity to defend his plan for clean power by or the report from the national energy system operator that be publish early in the year perhaps that be why we be be give a slightly long statement than usual make up for miss opportunity however we welcome the met office ’s report which make for interesting reading i think we can all attest to the fact that britain today be warm than it be before 
 we all agree that the challenge of the change climate be vast and it be of many challenge face the united kingdom today but i must tell the house and the right hon gentleman that ridiculous statement such as that make this morning by the environment secretary label opponent of net unpatriotic be as offensive as it be risible and do nothing to advance the cause i must also express my grow sense of unease and that of many other about the language emanating from those surround this secretary of state accuse anyone who dare to question the policy or plan be work on by his department of be denier or be supportive of an end to our british way of life we need to bring back a sense of rationality or proportion to this debate because out there language such as this be alienate more and more people from the important cause of ensure that the planet we pass on to our child and their child be in a well state than the we have inherit 
 the secretary of state call this radical truth telling but i be afraid that he be not be honest with the british people about the impact of the government ’s plan on the climate bill and job or about the sacrifice it demand the leader of the opposition have be very clear chase net by be unachievable without make the country bad off that be the truth global warming be a global issue which we can not face alone the global climate challenge will not be solve by the uk alone and it can not be solve on the back of british worker or british bill payer 
 order we need to be careful about what we say i think that the hon gentleman have suggest that the secretary of state be not honest and i think we be all honest member here 
 i completely agree mr speaker and i apologise if i insinuate the opposite in any way 
 the uk account for less than of global emission that be also the truth in fact now that i come to think of it it be rather shameful that the secretary of state should be use this report from the met office as cover while ratchet up the language and increase the shrill criticism of all who question the department and its policy all to distract from the fact that the plan mean that britain will be poor and that no   look at how we be decarbonise could ever claim that this be a model to follow we be proud to have be a world leader 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 member do not give way when make or respond to a statement 
 we be proud to have be a world leader but it be not a race if no else be run if we be lead the way we need to make sure that it be a path that other will follow we must decarbonise in a way that create energy security and prosperity rather than force industry abroad and impoverish british people why be that so hard for the labour party to understand 
 we see in the met office ’s report that the demand for cooling have approximately double a strong case for introduce more air conditioning into home which would improve comfort and reduce the burden on the health system during heatwave although i welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to expand the boiler upgrade scheme to include air to air heat pump which as he say offer cooling as well as heating may i urge he to speak to the mayor of london and get the ridiculous restriction on air conditioning unit in newbuild in london remove we must move away from this poverty mindset on reduce energy usage pay for solar panel to be switch off while refuse to absorb the excess demand to cool home be truly ridiculous 
 it be time to take the global scale and nature of this challenge seriously offshore manufacturing like ceramic do not solve global warming but it do make britain poor and brit unemployed to build this government ’s new home we will use more brick that at any time since the world war but thank to this government few than ever before will be make here in britain while the secretary of state admire the fast pace build out of new renewable generation new nuclear and low carbon energy on an unseen scale on his recent visit to the people ’s republic of china perhaps he be able to reflect on the factor enable that the opening of new coal fire power station every week and the cost of industrial energy in china be less than a of our domestic cost we can not innovate manufacture and create growth and prosperity while our energy cost be kill manufacturing i be afraid that this government ’s plan will drive up the underlie cost of energy for industry and britain will pay the price 
 only a year ago labour candidate be trot out line on how they would cut bill by £ since then network charge which account for of an energy bill have rise by over £ as a result of the rush to build out the grid for new renewable cornwall insights an independent energy analyst have call for the secretary of state to be 
 transparent about what the money be be spend on 
 its principal consultant have urge the secretary of state to be honest with the public about the impact of net policy cost on bill 
 of course a clean secure and reliable power source exist in the form of nuclear we welcome the announcement of the commitment to sizewell c and the small modular reactor programme but the lack of ambition the refusal to commit to a gigawatt scale reactor preferably   on anglesey the decision to decommission the uk ’s stockpile of plutonium the selection of only small modular reactor technology and the refusal to repeat the gw ambition that we set out for the nuclear industry be frustrating we could do so much more will the secretary of state commit to protect wylfa for a new gigawatt scale reactor in the future 
 it be indeed time for a policy of radical honesty global warming be a global challenge and i be afraid the secretary of state ’s plan will have a negligible or even negative impact on global emission sadly he be drive by ideology not by the practicality of face this challenge while grow the economy we be tell the difficult truth the government be run from reality 
 i will be honest mr speaker i just feel incredibly sad when i listen to the hon gentleman and not in a good way the trouble be that we be now in a situation in which the shadow secretary of state go into hiding when there be a statement about the climate crisis because it be just too embarrassing to try to articulate the opposition ’s position 
 the central chasm at the heart of the hon gentleman ’s response be that he and his colleague have take the decision to abandon year of bipartisanship on climate theresa may ’s promise to deliver net by be of the great stride forward but he be now trash that and say it be a disaster let we be honest it be grossly irresponsible we be expect to believe that the conservatives oppose net because they know year in advance of the target that it can not be achieve but they can not possibly know that indeed the climate change committee say exactly the opposite in its late report the hon gentleman say he be worried about cost but all the evidence suggest that delay action cost more not less the ccc say net will cut energy bill and the cost of motoring 
 we do not even know whether the conservatives want a net target at all or no net target ever the hon gentleman say something the other week i read his interview with care in my spare time about reach net by not be base on the science but he be absolutely wrong the intergovernmental panel on climate change say 
 in model pathway with no or limited overshoot of ° c global net anthropogenic co2 emission decline by about from level by reach net around 
 the point be that net be a target that theresa may adopt drive by the science 
 what be the conservatives they be anti science anti job anti energy security and anti future generation i have to say that i can not put it well than theresa may—[interruption   the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy   should be quiet because he use to work for she this be what theresa may the conservative prime minister just or so year ago have say 
 those of we who advocate accelerate our progress towards net emission be label fanatic and zealot ironically the name call often emanate from ideologue at the political extreme or from populist who offer only easy answer to complex question 
 i could not put it well myself 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 select committees look at the evidence follow the evidence and make recommendation on the basis of the evidence today we have hear from the secretary of state the evidence from the met office about the seriousness of the threat the reality of the nature of the crisis and the fact that that will only grow the shadow minister miss something because he need to acknowledge not just the cost of take action but the cost of not do so the secretary of state read out those cost £ or of gdp if we get ° of warm accord to the obr 
 those oppose climate action in this place can also see the evidence that cheap driving and home heating be already available to many people and we should be make they available to as many people as possible they also know that switch to low carbon electricity as much and as fast as we can will make this country safe by get control of our energy generation and supply do the secretary of state agree that the patriotic approach be to work together to cut emission for financial security nature and climate reason
