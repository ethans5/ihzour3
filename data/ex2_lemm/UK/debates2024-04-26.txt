 i thank the formidable team at the foreign commonwealth and development office and my noble friend lord ahmad the minister responsible for the   commonwealth and the deputy foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell who be not on the front bench today he be detain elsewhere but have be ably replace by the minister of state ministry of justice my right hon friend   the member for charnwood edward argar throughout those ministers have understand why the commonwealth parliamentary association status need to change why this be an important bill and why the work of the commonwealth parliamentary association be essential in support the strengthening of democracy around the world i thank they all and their team of official 
 at this stage of proceeding it be also important to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the clerks of the house and to thank they their guidance and recognition of the bill ’s importance combine with the support from the government have help get the bill to where it be today in particular i say a huge thank you to ms anne marie griffiths the clerk who have be advise we for her assistance in get the bill to this stage i hope you will forgive i mr speaker for thank you too you have a very special place in the heart of the cpa as do the lord speaker you be our joint president and in your work you support we enormously 
 organisation be support by this bill i thank the international committee of the red cross for its incredibly important work and for support i in the preparation of the bill i know how much time and consideration its london delegation have put in and eve la haye in the icrc legal team in geneva have also be heavily involve i thank all of they 
 the unique international humanitarian mandate and mission of the international committee of the red cross have be formally recognise by state in the geneva convention and additional protocol the bill will accord it a status or treatment in the uk equivalent to that of an international organisation with the relevant privilege and immunity to date more than state have accord the icrc those relevant privilege and immunity include all other permanent member of the united nations security council the content of the bill and the conferral of relevant privilege and immunity to the icrc in the uk be critical to enable it to continue to operate in the uk in accordance with its international mandate maintain its strict adherence to the principle of neutrality impartiality and independence and its working method of confidentiality 
 for more than year there have be intense work to get to this stage it have be describe as a labour of love none of it could have be accomplish without the esteemed individual and organisation that i mention the perseverance from everyone be start to be reward now but there be much more to do i welcome the fact that the bill and the amendment debate and agree to in committee have receive cross party support again demonstrate the high regard and esteem in which both the cpa and icrc be hold not only in this place but throughout the country and internationally 
 member of a number of overseas parliaments in particular have reiterate how important the bill be we have listen and learn and go forward with this historic legislation which be now well on its way to put in place such a fundamental change 
 the bill be integral to the cpa and the icrc as it provide the necessary power for both organisation to be treat in a manner comparable with an international organisation of which the united kingdom or his majesty ’s government in the united kingdom be a member each organisation have its own role and constitutional arrangement that have to be and be reflect in the bill under certain clause secondary legislation can put in place the privilege and immunity that each organisation will need 
 the commonwealth parliamentary association element of the bill will be widely and warmly welcome by our fellow parliamentarian throughout the commonwealth i recall that on my recent visit to kenya the speaker of that parliament remind i how vital it be to the african region of the cpa to achieve this new status for the organisation parliamentarian from africa have long champion the need for this legislation and make the point that they want to continue to be part of the cpa because of the important work that it do but they increasingly struggle to justify spend their taxpayer money with the cpa configure as a uk charity a status that i believe we have long outgrow concern about the cpa ’s status date back more than decade if that can now be resolve i believe that will serve to strengthen and renew the cpa ’s mission unity and sense of purpose 
 i attend the commonwealth parliamentary conference in ghana last october where i see once again the strength of feeling across the cpa membership about the status of our organisation mr speaker last month you host speakers and presiding officer from the commonwealth in london for commonwealth day where you ensure that they be brief about the progress that we be make on the bill the response be extremely warm and positive a collective sigh of relief that this issue might be reach a solution 
 i be mindful however that the bill will need to pass through the other place to become an act so may i say once again that without this legislation there be a strong possibility that the commonwealth parliamentary association would relocate its headquarters outside the uk by enact the bill the uk can not only keep the cpa here but demonstrate our commitment to the commonwealth itself in this its year 
 i be delighted that key amendment be pass in committee the of which recognise the unique and sensitive role of the icrc include visit prisoner all around the world to help ensure their safety it allow for protect icrc information to be exempt from disclosure requirement impose by an order of court or tribunal proceeding other than criminal proceeding the amendment be design to protect information that the icrc provide in confidence to his majesty ’s government from be use in uk civil proceeding that be necessary as the withholding of confidential information from public disclosure can not otherwise be assure that reflect the icrc ’s standard working method of confidentiality which be design to protect not only its staff but its operation in active conflict zone that principle also underpin the icrc ’s ability to operate in dangerous location on sensitive issue engage with both state and non state actor disclosure of confidential icrc information could   damage its ability to perform its sensitive function when negotiate with conflict party and it could put its staff and operation at risk there be a real risk and concern about icrc information be use in legal proceeding over the past year the icrc ’s confidentiality have be challenge some time in the uk 
 i table in committee a probe amendment on the involvement of individual in draw up secondary legislation i do not press it to a vote and i thank the minister in committee   the hon member for aldershot leo docherty for his extremely reassuring response to the debate on it the amendment seek to lay down a formal requirement on the foreign secretary to consult the chair of the uk branch and secretary general of the cpa and the president and director general of the icrc respectively before finalise secondary legislation 
 the minister be able to confirm that the foreign commonwealth and development office will consult all those party ahead of secondary legislation be lay before the house and will work closely with they to agree arrangement for the appropriate privilege and immunity for each organisation separately that ensure that the bill work exactly in the way that the relevant organisation need it to and that the right individual be consult before secondary legislation be lay before the house and implement 
 the bill demonstrate that the house of commons value the commonwealth value the work of the commonwealth parliamentary association respect the importance of the icrc and recognise that these organisation need to be recognise as international organisation i thank colleague for their support and i wish my bill well as it continue its journey to the other place take forward ably by my noble friend baroness d’souza 
 i thank dame maria miller for everything she have do to ensure a solid future for the cpa it be much welcome and appreciate by all side of this house 
 i do not intend to detain the house for long but i will start by pay warm tribute to   the right hon member for basingstoke dame maria miller since become chair of the cpa uk branch she have spearhead and force this issue with ministers in the strong possible term include or i can not quite remember foreign secretary she have be at the forefront of this work key reason why that work have be so important the right hon lady have speak at length on that as you just do mr. speaker be that it send a message to the commonwealth parliamentary association that the uk government and this parliament be listen to what member state be tell we 
 i be privileged to serve as of representative from the cpa british islands and mediterranean region on the international committee of the cpa there have be some very difficult conversation over the past year i have serve on that body include in this be not some travel guide mr speaker but it do come up frequently when you be travel with the cpa gibraltar canada and at our most recent cpa conference last   year ghana where i and the force that be   the hon member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger   be quite rightly cross examine by nearly all member state of the cpa international about when the bill will move forward i be delighted and slightly relieved that the various commitment that the hon gentleman the right hon member for basingstoke and i have be give to that body for the past year be now at least at the halfway mark 
 and a half year ago we feel like we be nowhere so in that context the speed of the last few month have be wonderfully refreshing i pay tribute to the previous foreign secretary   the right hon member for braintree james cleverly and the current foreign secretary and the minister in the lords for their genuine engagement with the process key element have be the ability of my own front bench and the government to work cross party on set the standard support the commonwealth family and listen to the commonwealth family of nation 
 the bill be about set the cpa and the international committee of the red cross on an equal footing with many other international organisation we be in essence simply catch up but nevertheless it be crucial to how we as a parliament uk government and official opposition work with commonwealth nation when do those cros examination i will put it like that from member state the key theme throughout have be that they would like the cpa international to remain in the uk there have be no animosity about its remain in london but what they want be the status issue resolve i recall an excellent conversation here with an australian delegation who talk about how they could help and work with the government to try to ensure it be make very clear that member state across the world want the cpa international to remain in the uk 
 this be a warmly welcome bill it send the right message which be genuinely very important when we head to sydney later this year for the cpa international we will now be able to say all be well in the other place of course and i look forward to the minister ’s remark that we have deliver i do think that be genuinely important finally i pay tribute to you mr speaker because as the right hon lady say i feel that you have personally move mountain on a lot of this work it have be truly welcome and value by all of we in the cpa uk and by the cpa staff both internationally and in the uk i always warmly welcome your support 
 i thank   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   for his speech and i thank you mr speaker for the work you have do i congratulate my right hon friend   the member for basingstoke dame maria miller   on bring forward this important bill i welcome the support it have receive from both side of the house and i be pleased to offer my own support 
 the bill be quite technical in nature it make provision for specific organisation to be grant international status which owe to their unique constitution could not be include under exist legislation however the wording of the legislation should not distract we from   the organisation cite in it moreover we should not overlook the primary purpose of these organisation which be to strengthen parliamentary democracy and provide humanitarian assistance in a world where we frequently witness the devastation cause by violence and war and the grow threat to democracy the importance of those cause and the organisation that pursue they can not be understate i therefore welcome the bill which grant international organisation status to both the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross the new status will ensure that those organisation can continue to perform their vital work fully and without restriction 
 the commonwealth parliamentary association seek to promote the value of parliamentary democracy and good governance it facilitate dialogue between parliaments and draw on our collective knowledge to improve our procedure and address the wide range challenge that we as parliamentarian may face its effort have include the development of recommend benchmark for legislature and for a code of conduct for member its effort have include the development of recommend benchmark for legislature and for a code of conduct for member it have also provide guidance on specific and pertinent issue such as improve mental health provision the challenge of climate change and the growth of ai 
 i welcome the government ’s unwavere support for the commonwealth and its ideal article of the commonwealth charter outline our responsibility 
 for uphold and promote democratic culture and practice 
 i would therefore ask what support the government and parliament have provide to the cpa to strengthen democracy across the commonwealth 
 the fundamental mission of the international committee of the red cross be to protect victim of conflict and violence through the provision of humanitarian assistance its work often in the most difficult and perilous environment encompass everything from mine clearance and provide healthcare and sanitation to combat sexual violence improve respect for international humanitarian law and establish economic stability i be very proud of the united kingdom ’s record in provide humanitarian aid across the world to afghanistan to south sudan to ukraine and right now to gaza however what support have the government provide to the icrc and what can we as members of parliament do to support the red cross 
 ultimately if we be to grant international status to these organisation let we also ensure that we fully support they in their operation and in their aim strengthen democracy and humanitarian aid 
 i commend my right hon friend   the member for basingstoke dame maria miller   for make progress with this important bill which will recognise both the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross as international organisation these be important change give that neither be recognise as such under uk law current law can not apply as neither be an intergovernmental organisation so a new enable power be necessary 
 the cpa do vital work in promote parliamentary democracy throughout the commonwealth but its current set up as a uk charity be a cause for concern among some member and be somewhat restrictive the bill seek to address that the commonwealth be a unique club of nation unite by our share historical and economic tie alongside a share belief in the value of democracy and the rule of law in an increasingly hostile world where the rule of ruthless autocrat be on the rise and democratic right be under threat advance those basic value and support the flourishing of parliamentary democracy throughout the commonwealth remain as important now as it be when the cpa be found in that be why the bill be so important to ensure the cpa remain relevant and well place to promote parliamentary democracy throughout the commonwealth that will allow the cpa to participate more fully internationally than it do today remove some of the restriction on it 
 more than country and jurisdiction participate in the cpa as well as more than legislator it help to increase the participation of under represent group in commonwealth parliaments include woman disabled people and young people the organisation also do vital work to help develop share learning throughout parliamentary democracy across the commonwealth facilitate knowledge sharing and help to strengthen our democratic system 
 the organisation that the bill focus on the international committee of the red cross do hugely important humanitarian work to protect victim of conflict and violence around the world this week the prime minister announce the government ’s commitment to increase spending on defence to which be incredibly welcome particularly as it will be fund through much need efficiency saving in whitehall rather than tax rise it reflect the increase threat we face from our adversary globally in an increasingly insecure world 
 the work of the international red cross and red crescent movement be more important than ever conflict have ignite around the world whether follow putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine or the horrific turmoil in the middle east in gaza and israel in addition to ukraine israel and the occupied palestinian territories the icrc have key operation in afghanistan the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia the sahel sudan syria and yemen in all such conflict innocent civilian be catch up in the violence and harm by the result of war and that be why the bill be so essential 
 alongside the cpa the bill also seek to recognise the icrc properly as an international organisation under international law through the geneva convention the icrc already have a specific and unique humanitarian mandate to act in time of international conflict and it have be give wide recognition internationally through the right of a humanitarian initiative more than state around the world have already recognise the icrc and give it equivalent status to an international organisation so it be only right that the uk follow suit that be particularly important as it would allow the icrc to operate in the uk while preserve its core principle of neutrality and independence 
 a number of amendment agree in committee far improve the quality of the bill particularly those on the importance of the confidentiality of the information that the icrc provide to the government and during legal proceeding as my right hon friend the member for basingstoke say confidentiality be critical and remain a fundamental principle of the icrc those change be eminently sensible give the sensitivity of the information that will often be deal with in such circumstance that be particularly important in protect victim during conflict and bring justice through criminal prosecution to those who commit such crime 
 i again congratulate my right hon friend and thank she for bring forward the bill i wish it well on its continued passage through the other place 
 i be delighted to see you in the chair mr speaker long may you reign 
 it be a privilege to speak in favour of the bill introduce by my right hon friend   the member for basingstoke dame maria miller i pay huge tribute to she as she have be the flag bearer for the commonwealth parliamentary association for the whole time i have be in this house and a half year of the conversation we ever have be about how important it be particularly for a new member of parliament to be part of the cpa i take she at her word and i have be delighted to be involve in that brilliant association 
 can we also pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for basingstoke for the work she do with new parliamentarian when we come into the house she specifically promote woman in this parliament in order to reach 50:50 status this be about not just the work she have do for the cpa but what she have do for woman in this place 
 absolutely i will not spare my right hon friend ’s blush she be not only a brilliant parliamentarian but she support new members of parliament and i have be the beneficiary of her advice 
 i have be the supporter of the incredible work of the commonwealth parliamentary association for many year and this bill will cement in law the difference it have make across our beloved commonwealth over the past year i also welcome the bill as it recognise the work the icrc do to support region in crisis from australia to anguilla from botswana to the british virgin islands the cpa be crucial in keep all parliamentarian connect across the globe share good practice help we to learn from each other and foster friendly positive and long last friendship across the parliaments and legislature that make up the commonwealth family 
 as my hon friend be make her remark about how we learn from other parliaments i recall sit in the new zealand parliament for question morning where the speaker take an interesting role if the speaker be not satisfied with an answer the minister give he ask for the question to be answer again do she think we should consider do that here as well 
 i can always do that if you want laughter 
 my right hon friend make a good point and i be sure those on the front bench would be delighted to comment on it in their speech 
 the icrc be an essential partner for achieve the core objective of the uk ’s humanitarian framework which be 
 prioritise humanitarian assistance to people in great need and provide they with what they need the most to recover from crisis protect the people most at risk include from conflict relate sexual violence and barrier to humanitarian assistance prevent and anticipate future shock and build resilience in long run crisis by tackle the underlie driver of crisis instability and extreme food insecurity 
 nobody could ever argue with any of that 
 the icrc be much respect not only in this country but abroad it carry with it an unparalleled ability to engage with all party engage in a conflict and it support innocent civilian catch up in the crossfire the amendment table by my right hon friend in committee be crucial to the successful operation of the icrc amendment and be design to protect information that the icrc provide in confidence to the government from be use in uk civil court proceeding icrc information be use in legal proceeding be a real risk and concern i be surprised to learn that in the past year the icrc ’s confidentiality have be challenge some time in the uk be it in respect of disclose information regard its work with british force abroad or of its dialogue with a variety of actor on the global stage 
 today i will be focus my comment on the cpa as i have be fortunate to work closely with it during my time in this place 
 before my hon friend leave the subject of the icrc let i take the opportunity again to highlight the importance of the amendment introduce in committee she reiterate the number of time the icrc have be threaten with have to divulge very confidential information do she like i hope that that be take into consideration when the bill go to the other place obviously provide that confidentiality and the need not to divulge such information except in criminal case be an important step do she agree that we need to make sure those provision be in place for civil case as soon as possible i hope that no debate in the lords will delay their come into effect 
 i thank my right hon friend for her intervention she make a serious point if organisation such as the international committee of the red cross be to succeed in their objective they have to be trust in the region and country they serve they have to deal with people who we may not wish to deal with ourselves to bring an end to conflict or even to safeguard civilian life and prevent sexual violence in conflict i hope the other place which tend to be clear when scrutinise bills will see her point and will accept those amendment and not change the bill 
 as i say i would like to move on and concentrate my remark on the commonwealth parliamentary association because of the work that i have be delighted to undertake with that brilliant organisation as a term mp i can confirm that i will be a term mp because i be stand down at the next election and as the mp for cities of london and westminster at this   point i have be proud to support the commonwealth parliamentary association in fact only this week i be honour to speak to a delegation from the malaysian parliament include his excellency johari abdul speaker of the house of representatives as well as member of the house of representatives special select committees and several parliamentary official it be fascinating as usual to learn how similar our parliamentary procedure be such as timetabling where our model very much mirror theirs that be bar the malaysian parliament ’s provision in the procedure you may be interested to learn this mr speaker for the head of state to make a statement every morning it could be interesting to introduce that practice here in the commons i be not sure whether his majesty would like to come every day to make a speech i personally 
 order also his majesty be not allow into the house of commons 
 i have forget that small point maybe we should just move on 
 the malaysian version of the procedure committee i be proud to sit on the uk ’s procedure committee be call the standing order committee i be ask to speak to the malaysian delegation about the procedure of the house of commons how business be table the standing orders and my experience on the procedure committee what a week to be discuss the procedure of parliament it be fortunate that i be able to use a certain act the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act which we see this week with its extend ping pong to demonstrate how the uk parliament work in practice 
 do my hon friend recognise not only that the work she do on the procedure committee help shape this parliament but the importance of people visit parliament and see the procedure when we talk about the life of an mp when we go to local school they always ask we what ’ a typical day in parliament it be so difficult to explain that because there be no typical day in parliament some day we can finish at o’clock some day we can be sit here at midnight the work we do to teach other about the way this parliament work and about our job on a day to day basis be so important 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and it be fascinating this week for the malaysian delegation to sit in on deputy prime minister ’s question it be quite a raucous episode this week particularly give the question i do not see the delegation afterwards but i would have be interested to hear their view on our procedure for dpmq 
 in i be delighted to address delegate from the isle of man when i represent cpa uk i be able to discuss my experience of manage parliamentary responsibility include committee work attendance in the chamber constituency work and personal commitment that go back to the point my hon friend just make there be never a typical day in the life of an mp i can come into this place with my meeting for the day in my diary and then all of a sudden there be an urgent question or a statement that i want to be part of and then my diary be completely change it be a   fascinating job to do and i be sure it be the same everywhere from the conversation i have have with parliamentarian across the globe parliamentary procedure be never size fit all 
 i personally find meet those delegation whether in this country or abroad very enlightening i encourage all member of the house to work with the commonwealth parliamentary association to meet learn from and share insight with other parliamentarian from across the commonwealth although there will be many mp who will not be come back to this place because of retirement or whatever 
 on the point about member engagement the hon lady will know that i be privileged to be the treasurer of the cpa branch the right hon member for basingstoke dame maria miller   be the chair and we spend a lot of time try to encourage both long serve and new member not to be afraid of the cpa but to come and take part in inward delegation and ideally engage in our work abroad my hope be that this bill and this debate on the floor of the house highlight again the successful work of the cpa that the hon lady be canter through which hopefully mean that member now and member after a general election will be encourage to work with it do she agree 
 i absolutely agree with the hon member it be very important that any candidate who be seek to become a parliamentarian and be successful whenever a general election may be do get involve in the cpa once they arrive here it be an enlightening experience and it help we as parliamentarian to be learn from other not just in the united kingdom but across the globe 
 it do feel as though my hon friend and i have be here for a lifetime but when we enter as new parliamentarian of the fear over engage with the like of the cpa be the public ’s reflection on the travel and so on it be vital that we highlight in this chamber how important it be for parliamentarian to be able to witness how parliament work in other part of the world do she agree that it be important that through these debate we continue to highlight the importance of the cpa so that member do not avoid engage with the like of the cpa through fear 
 i completely agree although this be the mother of all parliaments it have be here for a year or more we really should be able to learn from other 
 i thank my hon friend for give way my other hon friend   the member for hyndburn sara britcliffe be right to point out the need for we to explain the benefit of the cpa because much of our day to day work as members be connect to the grassroot of what we do in our constituency but the role of a parliamentarian be so much great than that i will give an example my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   be talk about her meeting with the malaysian parliament early this week i have the great pleasure of meet the hon rodiyah binti sapiee who be a member of the malaysian parliament and be a new regional representative for the commonwealth women parliamentarians network we   have not touch upon that organisation much in this debate so far but it be there to support elect member very much in the way that my hon friend the member for hyndburn speak about support new member to do their job as well as they can and hopefully retain they work in parliament for long the malaysian parliament have female member just of their parliamentarian and we discuss way to increase the number of woman parliamentarian do my hon friend agree that we can learn from each other about these question in our parliaments throughout the commonwealth because we have such similar set up 
 order i be be very generous in allow the scope to be broaden somewhat i now look forward to hear more from nickie aiken 
 thank you mr speaker i agree with my right hon friend about woman support woman we do a great job of support woman in this parliament and i be delighted to be part of her cross party woman in parliament group we have to have strength in number and we have to encourage more woman to stand whether in cpa country or our own because we have to hear woman ’s voice in politic 
 do my hon friend agree this be not just about encourage woman but i consider myself to be a relatively young person it be also about include more young people into parliamentary democracy across the commonwealth 
 i thank my hon friend for his point and i believe the cpa can be a force for good in share good practice for encourage people from all walk of life to enter politic i be about to go on to talk about my experience with the cpa in grenada where there be many young people who have be elect for the time it strengthen all democracy if they represent the people they be there to serve 
 as i be the young on our benches i be not yet thankfully may i ask my hon friend to explain how grenada manage to get young people into its parliament and also how they can feel they can stay in the job of the problem young people and all member of parliament face be the rise in abuse on social medium which can strongly put people off enter this place people enter this place to do good thing for their constituent and that be not always reflect through our medium and social medium how be other parliaments across the commonwealth tackling that 
 order this debate be about the movement and transfer of the cpa i have get to be a little bit careful because other people may want to stretch the scope of other bills when we do not want they stretch this be an important subject and the house be very supportive but we must ensure that we stick within the term of the bill 
 i just reiterate that i support the point my hon friend have just make because it be important that we make sure that the cpa be a force for good 
 in the cities of london and westminster the commonwealth be right at home we be fortunate to host the international headquarters of the commonwealth secretariat and the commonwealth foundation in   marlborough house and of course the commonwealth parliamentary association for the united kingdom operate from here in the mother of all parliaments 
 my hon friend be right to bring up the importance of the international secretariat be here right in the heart of westminster and that have enable we to work with it as cpa uk and as the uk parliament around international women ’s day for example we work with it to deal with online abuse which have just be raise we set up as we can now with the advent of the widespread use of teams and other facility for online meeting online training for woman parliamentarian across the commonwealth do my hon friend agree that that be just example of how we can work as a team with the cpa and how have it so close to we here in parliament help we effectively support its work in this way 
 i absolutely agree that go to the heart of the bill the status of the cpa and whether we can consolidate it we be just across the road from the foreign office and this be about work together for the soft power element that the government be focus on 
 the commonwealth parliamentary association work as many here will know to promote parliamentary democracy and good governance it be completely non partisan i have thoroughly enjoy meeting and get to know parliamentarian from a wide range of country and political party back in march last year i be fortunate enough to be invite to be a member of the cpa uk delegation to the stunning island of grenada in the caribbean where i be honour to meet prime minister dickon mitchell that be my trip for the cpa and what a fascinating it be i pay tribute to the cpa officer martin vickery who be outstanding on the trip and i know that the clerk at the table who be also there will always remember it it be my experience of the cpa in action 
 grenada have have the same government and prime minister for of the previous year but dickon mitchell defeat the incumbent keith mitchell who be seek his term in the election i wonder whether a prime minister have ever before succeed another with the same surname the incumbent new national party have have all seat in the grenadian parliament but after the election it be suddenly in opposition as dickon mitchell ’s national democratic congress take of the available seat the election bring about certain new challenge for the parliament of grenada for the national democratic congress which have no experience in government and for the new national party which have not be in opposition for decade 
 that go back to the point make by my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent south jack brereton   about have new and young parliamentarian none of the mp elect for the national democratic congress have ever be elect or even be in politic before the prime minister dickon mitchell have be a solicitor so it be fascinating for the cpa uk to be invite over to undertake a series of workshop on how to be scrutinise and equally importantly on how to scrutinise 
 i be join on the trip by   the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy and by my hon friend   the member for east kilbride strathaven and lesmahagow   dr cameron who be then a member of the scottish national party at the time but have since defect to the conservative party although i would not take any credit for persuade she on the trip that she be a conservative in grenada i also work very closely with leo cato the speaker of the house of representatives of grenada and with dessima williams the president of the senate of grenada 
 dessima williams be a former communist who be very much part of the revolution in grenada in the early 80 we woman politician from completely different side of the political divide bond so incredibly well and that underline how important it be that the bill secure the cpa ’s status ms williams say to i as i leave only the cpa could bring a communist and a conservative together i think that be a clear example of how parliamentarian no matter their political persuasion can put their political party aside and work together for the great good that be the extraordinary power that the cpa provide 
 during my trip i also meet woman ’s right campaigner people work to improve disability right and service and very importantly the youth parliament and climate change campaigner this go back to what my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south say early we meet the youth parliament and they be outstanding young people who want to make a difference for their country as a woman ’s right campaigner i find it fascinating to talk to other campaigner who be work very hard to tackle violence against woman and girl our trip coincide with international women ’s day and i be privileged to be invite to make a speech at the prime minister ’s event to over grenadian schoolgirl although i do not expect it to be air live on grenadian tv which be an experience 
 i be then delighted to welcome speaker cato and the president of the senate dr williams to my constituency only a few week ago during the anniversary of the commonwealth of nations celebration which be preside over by mr speaker my brilliant constituency team thoroughly enjoy discuss with they the day to day work of an mp ’s office and hear how this differ from their experience in some way but also mirror they in other we be also join by chantelle de jonge a member of the legislative assembly of alberta in canada that be a clear example of how the cpa bring parliamentarian from across different country together 
 my hon friend be talk eloquently and with a great deal of passion about her visit to grenada her visit be just of a number of different delegation that the cpa uk send out thank to the financial support of this place and the other place to ensure that members of parliament can carry out the work and relationship development she mention do she agree that it be very important that parliament continue to reiterate its support for cpa uk give the good store that members of parliament set by it they feel very strongly about the work of the cpa it be a real priority for parliamentarian the cpa must therefore continue to be a financial priority for parliament 
 i completely agree which be why i be fully supportive of the objective of the bill 
 i also agree with   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse   when she say in committee that 
 this bill create equal partner in the commonwealth rather than the more outdated model where the uk take the leadership”.––[official report commonwealth parliamentary association and international committee of the red cross status public bill committee   march c. 
 the bill provide the necessary delegate legislation make power for the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross to be treat in a manner comparable to an international organisation of which the uk be a member due to the power under the international development act and the international organisations act which be even old than i be the government have not be able to treat the commonwealth parliamentary association or the international committee of the red cross as international organisation to which they be party because neither organisation be an intergovernmental organisation instead both have their own unique constitutional arrangement reflect their specific international priority 
 therefore it be absolutely necessary to establish special power to enable the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross to operate in the united kingdom it be welcome that the bill be support by party from across the house it will provide the international committee of the red cross with more protection for its work the bill will ensure that the commonwealth parliamentary association can continue to strengthen democracy and encourage cross party work i look forward to support the bill through its stage and once again congratulate my right hon friend the member for basingstoke on her outstanding work to get we where we be today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i pay tribute to   the right hon member for basingstoke dame maria miller whose dedication and commitment to this matter have be a labour of love over the past year and the reason we be all here today i also pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for ogmore chris elmore whose work on the cpa both here in the uk and internationally have be critical in help we get to where we be now i thank the hon member for hyndburn sara britcliffe for stoke on trent south jack brereton and for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for their support and for their eloquent speech today 
 the cpa be a highly value organisation many of we on both side of the house have benefit from its work and will continue to do so for year to come so i be pleased to support the bill today on behalf of the opposition it could not be well time we celebrate the anniversary of the commonwealth early this month with a day conference here in westminster host by mr speaker i thank he for do so and for his work in pull the issue together and ensure that they remain prominent 
 the commonwealth have grow from a group of country in to a diverse body of nation with a population of today its member range from large develop country to those that be emerge and develop include some of the small nation on earth i be recently fortunate enough to travel with a cpa delegation to belize and it be great to be there as part of my brief in the shadow foreign commonwealth and development office team meet member of its parliament and learn how it work and meeting official committee member member of the belize government and the speaker the visit allow we to build critical relationship and an understanding of the challenge that the country face as we have hear from other member on both side of the house these relationship be crucial throughout the commonwealth and i think we can all agree that today we should celebrate it for the modern institution that it be of which we can be proud 
 i also want to put on the record that labour be keen to ensure that the cpa headquarters stay right here in westminster in london as the bill intend labour be very proud of the cpa ’s ongoing role in bring together and liaise between the parliaments in the commonwealth family from the very building that inspire the way in which most of the commonwealth be govern today it be important for the cpa to be grant privilege and immunity similar to those enjoy by comparable organisation such as the commonwealth foundation and the commonwealth of learning that enhanced status will strengthen the influence of commonwealth parliamentarian and give the cpa a more authoritative presence internationally and i know that parliaments and parliamentarian across the commonwealth will welcome it because it will have a positive impact on the wide commonwealth and help to maintain unity and stability in time when the international order parliamentary democracy and human right face huge and serious challenge 
 the hon lady have touch on the importance of the privilege and immunity afford by the bill not only to the cpa but to the icrc do she agree that it be important that the government have give undertaking that those immunity when they be set out in secondary legislation will be discuss in detail beforehand with the necessary party in both organisation to ensure that the bill work in the way that be intend 
 i absolutely agree with the right hon lady and i will ask that of the government i thank she for point it out 
 i be pleased that the bill seek to grant the cpa a bespoke legal status like that enjoy by the inter parliamentary union in swiss law and by the assemblée parlementaire de la francophonie our french equivalent in french law hold a legal status akin to our parliamentary strengthening counterpart should enhance the organisation ’s standing if the cpa be not grant this legal status there be a real risk of inter parliamentary division and fragmentation which could have broad ramification for the unity of the commonwealth 
 the international committee of the red cross be a neutral independent and impartial humanitarian organisation mandate by the international community   to protect and assist victim of armed conflict and other situation of violence the icrc have be grant privilege and immunity by state and the uk be not of they that absence have result in significant operational challenge and the granting of privilege and immunity have become a matter of urgency obtain privilege and immunity in the uk would facilitate the icrc ’s operational capacity to fulfil its mandate and manage its resource in a manner most beneficial to all affected and impact people it would also protect the icrc ’s ability to act as and to be perceive as a neutral independent and impartial humanitarian actor and it would protect the confidential nature of the icrc ’s work 
 it be essential that the icrc remain neutral and independent as it be only through strict adherence to these principle that it can obtain the trust of party to and victim of armed conflict as well as actor in other situation of violence this trust be crucial in secure humanitarian access to some of the most contested conflict zone 
 this bill go a long way in address the above and provide the mean for the icrc to obtain only the privilege and immunity strictly necessary for its functioning this include immunity from legal process for the icrc and its staff the inviolability of its property and the protection of confidential icrc information hold by the uk government from disclosure in legal proceeding 
 i ask the minister to reaffirm his assurance in committee that the require secondary legislation will be bring forward as soon as possible will he commit to consult both the icrc and the cpa ahead of that secondary legislation to ensure the appropriate privilege and immunity for each organisation 
 i be pleased to support this bill on behalf of the opposition and i commend the work that have go into it right across the house and particularly from the right hon member for basingstoke if we fail to get this right it would deal a real blow to the role of this house and the government on the world stage it would be see as a symbol of our lack of commitment and it would damage the potential of the cpa a grow and unique global organisation at a time when we should be redouble our effort to engage with our commonwealth partner and seek to expand the commonwealth i be confident there be a will on all side to ensure that the bill succeed 
 it be a genuine pleasure to speak at the dispatch box on behalf of my right hon friend the deputy foreign secretary and it be a pleasure for various reason i suspect this will be of my least challenging appearance at the dispatch box because my right hon friend   the member for basingstoke dame maria miller   have garner so much support for these measure across the house and in government 
 it be a pleasure to appear opposite and respond to once again the shadow minister   the hon member for cardiff north anna mcmorrin who shadow i in my role before she be move to a different team it be also important to put on record our gratitude as my right hon friend   the member for basingstoke dame   maria miller   do we be grateful to she to my hon friend   the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger   for his work to stephen twigg and his staff to mr speaker and indeed to the comptroller of his majesty ’s household my hon friend   the member for castle point rebecca harris who with the bill as with many other have do so much as the whip to ensure that it have progress smoothly and be hopefully within touching distance of become law 
 i will pay my own tribute to the comptroller of his majesty ’s household later when we come to my bill on private member bills this show the house at its good i think these measure have be debate in a minute rule bill and a previous private member ’s bill and i infer from   the right hon member for basingstoke dame maria miller   that this be a presentation bill that show the importance of the work of the house on a sitting friday to push through to the other place such legislation which be so important internationally to so many of our commonwealth partner as well as obviously the red cross 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right i often say when i be talk to school or more broadly in my constituency i suspect he do so in his that if our electorate want to see the house at its good they should watch the chamber on a sitting friday when we be debate private member bills there be often much cross party co operation and enlightening debate go away not only have hopefully move thing forward and achieve something but have learn something 
 before i turn to the substance of the bill i have a couple of other point to make i turn briefly to the suggestion make by my right hon friend the member for basingstoke and my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   about i think the canadian parliament 
 new zealand 
 i be sorry the new zealand parliament which give the power to the speaker or the chair that if a minister have not be deem by the chair to have give a sufficiently accurate or appropriate answer to a question they could have the question re put to the minister i gently say to my right hon friend that while that be an interesting suggestion it would be entirely redundant in this place give how ministers always answer directly the question pose to they as fully and helpfully as they can 
 the other reason it be a genuine pleasure to be here be that the bill have be bring forward by my right hon friend   the member for basingstoke the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   highlight that she have be forcefully push this issue to a conclusion i must say that have have the pleasure of work with she on various amendment to legislation in the past i have always find it wise to agree with she i be therefore pleased to confirm the government ’s support for the bill it be wise to agree with she not least because generally she be right in the point she be make as i know from experience so it be a genuine pleasure to speak on her bill on this occasion i recognise in do   so her work as chair of the cpa as well as her work with the westminster foundation for democracy and the huge value that that add 
 this be a hugely important bill reflect on important organisation in what can appear to be a fractured and increasingly dangerous world it be important that we remember and reinforce the role of democracy as a bulwark against authoritarianism and totalitarianism and indeed the conflict that can often flow from those 
 in respect of the cpa my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent south jack brereton   set out clearly the importance of its work to promote parliamentary democracy and good government through a range of activity and in a range of forum it be open and wide range in its promotion of democracy within the commonwealth context it be non partisan and non prescriptive it do a huge amount of work to capture the good of parliamentary democracy across the commonwealth propagate it and reinforce it 
 it be also important as the shadow minister do to recognise the importance of the commonwealth in that context she rightly highlight its anniversary it be an institution of endure success and endure value we can genuinely characterise it as the commonwealth family of nation because we do view all the other member of the commonwealth as family as i hope they would view we 
 the icrc be found year ago it be 
 an impartial neutral and independent organisation whose exclusively humanitarian mission be to protect the life and dignity of victim of armed conflict and other situation of violence and to provide they with assistance 
 that be from the icrc mandate its unique international humanitarian mandate and mission have be formally recognise as the shadow minister the hon member for cardiff north highlight by state in the geneva convention and their additional protocol this organisation have unique legitimacy to engage all party to conflict and have unparallele access to vulnerable group in conflict situation it be frequently the only agency operate at scale in many conflict as we look around the world at the conflict rag its work have never be more important 
 it be a pleasure to confirm the government ’s full support for the bill and to thank those member who have contribute today as set out by my right hon friend the member for basingstoke the bill will enable the government to treat the cpa and icrc in a manner genuinely comparable to that of an international organisation of which the uk or his majesty ’s government in the united kingdom be a member 
 the uk have as i have highlight a huge and long stand partnership with the cpa and we recognise the work it do the uk also view the icrc as an essential partner for achieve our global humanitarian objective with the organisation have unique legitimacy to engage all party to conflict and unparalleled access it also operate in some of the most challenging situation that anyone could face its specialised role in engage with all arm bearer include the grow number of non state armed group be couple with its direct delivery of a comprehensive range of integrated humanitarian assistance and protection programme 
 treatment as an international organisation will allow both the cpa and the icrc to deliver their objective while operate in the uk in the case of the cpa it will facilitate the organisation to operate fully across the commonwealth and international fora include in area where it be currently restrict by its charitable status while it be not possible under the international organisations act as be highlight by my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster to accord it the privilege and status it need this legislation fill that gap 
 for the icrc treatment as an international organisation will critically enable it to operate in the uk in accordance with its international mandate maintain its strict adherence to the principle of neutrality impartiality and independence and its standard working method of confidentiality which be design to protect its staff and operation in active conflict zone the public disclosure of information that the icrc obtain from confidential dialogue with conflict party be likely to put that at risk it be also a principle that underpin its ability to operate in dangerous location on sensitive issue engage with state and non state actor the bill have therefore be amend to include a provision for the protection of certain information relate to the icrc ’s sensitive work that it have provide in confidence to his majesty ’s government to stop it be use in court proceeding except for criminal proceeding the government consider this provision necessary but proportionate 
 treatment as an international organisation include the provision of privilege and immunity necessary to meet the functional need of the cpa and icrc in the uk in provide these privilege and immunity we will strengthen our partnership with both the cpa and icrc respectively it will enable these key partner to well deliver their objective 
 the list of privilege and immunity that might be confer on the cpa and icrc have be inform by the act that will allow the government to agree a framework that be unique and appropriate to each organisation ’s unique mandate the actual suite of privilege and immunity to be accord include relevant exception and limitation will be determine base on the functional need of each organisation and will be specify in secondary legislation and order in council for example the arrangement will make it clear as be standard practice that there will be no immunity from legal suit in the case of a motor traffic offence or damage cause by a motor vehicle 
 the financial implication of the bill be minimal and there will be little or no loss of revenue as a result of the fiscal exemption or relief which again will be grant by delegate legislation through the provision in the bill as be standard practice for international organisation certain taxis will be refund in accordance with the separate arrangement between the government and the cpa and icrc respectively in response to a point make by my right hon friend the member for basingstoke the shadow minister kindly give i advance warning that she would also raise it in her speech i be happy to reconfirm that the specific arrangement will be draw up in active consultation with the cpa and with the icrc respectively 
 i realise that the minister be make a reading speech so it be important not to go into detail but this element be introduce in   committee and we do not have the advantage of a report stage i would like to press the government on this particular point because the privilege and immunity section of the bill be clearly set out but it be important that those affect by the bill understand that those privilege and immunity be yet to be agree with the government it be important that they be agree well in advance of be lay before parliament so that everybody can be sight on what they mean in practice 
 as ever my right hon friend be right therefore subject to the passage of this legislation and prior to those regulation be introduce until they come into force they do not come into force we will work closely with those organisation so that when those regulation be lay and approve hopefully there will be no surprise in they because they will have work collaboratively with we to draw they up 
 the arrangement will detail the day to day management of the privilege and immunity grant to both organisation on a functional need basis and other facility furthermore administration of the arrangement will be resource from the exist resource responsible for manage privilege and immunity with international organisation in the uk 
 the bill strengthen our commitment to the work of the commonwealth and our support of democratic legislator through our work with the cpa it will also support the fcdo ’s global humanitarian objective ensure that the uk remain at the heart of an unrivalled global network for economic diplomatic and security partnership through our work with the icrc 
 hon member raise a couple of point which i will turn to before conclude i be grateful to my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   for a wide ranging informative and typically well inform contribution crave your indulgence madam deputy speaker may i take just a minute as i be conscious that my hon friend have announce that she will not seek re election at the next general election and who know whether i will get another opportunity at the dispatch box let i put on record my gratitude to she for everything she have do she and i serve together as fellow ward councillor on westminster city council before i be elect to this place and she be subsequently elect she be a fierce champion for what she believe to be right for her constituent and her community and she have demonstrate that as a councillor and leader of the council and now as a member of parliament she will be hugely miss by her constituent and by this house 
 my hon friend   the member for hyndburn sara britcliffe   ask what support his majesty ’s government will give beyond this legislation to both the organisation   that we be debate his majesty ’s government give the icrc £ of core funding annually and up to £ in bilateral donation we have a long stand and robust relationship with the icrc and a track record of support it my understanding be that we fund cpa international to the tune of £ and we give cpa uk £ we support they through not only this legislation and what we say in this house but tangible financial support 
 in an ever more challenging global context his majesty ’s government and my right hon friend the foreign commonwealth and development secretary remain committed to work with and support the work of the cpa and the icrc this bill give both organisation the status in legislation that they need and deserve to continue their international operation without impediment it reflect our commitment i once again congratulate my right hon friend the member for basingstoke the government continue to support the bill and i commend it to the house 
 with the leave of the house i call dame maria miller to wind up the debate 
 i thank the minister for his comment i be grateful to everybody who take part in the debate include my hon friend the members for hyndburn sara britcliffe for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken and for stoke on trent south jack brereton   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore i give he a special call out as he be the treasurer of the cpa and   the hon member for cardiff north anna mcmorrin i thank they for their fulsome support for this bill 
 i particularly thank the minister for set out so clearly how he will treat the secondary legislation that be require to make this bill work i join he in thank the comptroller of his majesty ’s household my hon friend   the member for castle point rebecca harris whom i do not thank early we be never quite sure how to thank whip in this place but i thank she very much for her incredible support she be involve in all thing to do with the fcdo 
 i thank everybody in the house of commons for their great support in recognise the icrc and the cpa as international organisation this bill will help both organisation to do their job even well i thank the minister and his colleague at the fcdo for their unstinting support which i hope continue as the bill pass to the other place 
 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read the time and pass 
 bill as amend in the public bill committee consider 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 i be delighted to be able to express thank to colleague from across the house for their support for this important bill i be grateful to the minister and his official for their highly constructive engagement at every stage it have be enormously helpful to draw on the department ’s formidable professionalism and expertise i thank the whips office and particularly the comptroller of his majesty ’s household my hon friend   the member for castle point rebecca harris for all her support i thank the house staff in the public bill office for their support i also thank the many organisation and individual who have help to inform this bill through conversation i have have with they and report i have read over many year i have manage to bring they together thank to the private member ’s bill ballot 
 i be a passionate believer in local government my experience at stoke on trent city council as a cabinet member for regeneration transport and heritage inform much of my keen interest in high street and how to deliver the mechanism that will co ordinate preserve and enhance they from my most recent engagement i particularly thank the royal institution of chartered surveyors the british property federation power to change the british retail consortium and the local government association for add greatly to my thinking and my determination to secure a bill with cross party support many conversation with local body individual and business over the year have inform the bill and i place on record my thank to they all most recently i meet representative of the stoke on trent business improvement district and i be delighted that they support my bill 
 no bill be without critic but where i have encounter they they have be good natured and constructive for the most part we have resolve our difference through clarification and amendment in committee it be a necessary debate and it have be conduct well i seem to have strike a chord with member across the house in argue that local authority should be guide towards well co ordination in ensure that they understand the dynamic of local high street in our constituency and should work in concert with local community property owner and high street business to preserve and enhance those treasured place in a way that serve and grow our local economy 
 our high street be the beat heart of our community which be again evident at the vibrant longton carnival and pig walk parade in my constituency last weekend it be incredible to see thousand of people flock to the town centre huge thank go to all the volunteer particularly those in urban wilderness and longton exchange shopping centre who help organise the event it be also fantastic to see the expansion of the number of retailer that be set up and the business that be open in longton we have see a reduce number of empty space particularly in the longton exchange shopping centre with new independent retailer   set up they include keep it local and so very dog and also across the road from my office the oatcake shop linny ’s kitchen which i occasionally like to pop into for my lunch 
 i also detect a strong belief that we as member should be active participant in agree local designation contribute to review and compile or comment on improvement plan for our area   the hon member for birmingham erdington mrs hamilton   make an excellent and passionate speech in committee in support of the principle of the bill and how determined she be to see improvement in erdington that she have be push for as a result of it i know our high street be close to her heart and i thank she for that powerful contribution 
 under the bill it will be for the secretary of state to draw up the guidance as he be an assiduous constituency mp i be confident that he will have read the mood of the house that members should be include as consultee that be important because it be also implicit in the bill that local authority will occasionally designate high street that include property that belong to body that be formally accountable to this house rather than to local government network rail be an obvious example indeed in committee the minister reveal that his own local high street area in redcar include station road which i believe end in redcar central station but i will leave the local knowledge to he it be important to leave as much of the process as we can as local as possible 
 i stress that in committee follow the passing of the money resolution on   march the minister explicitly promise money on the table for draw up review of up to high street area per local authority this money for up to designate high street improvement plan will be on top of that from the various grant maker with pot of national money body that be scrutinise by this house to which any designated high street might appeal to realise improvement and in particular to preserve the important heritage and iconic character of many of our high street it be right that member should be closely involve in help to deliver on improvement plan develop place partnership that enjoy local support leverage both local and/or national funding and optimise the co ordination of exist funding towards a compelling sense of direction for our high street 
 on reading i tell the house about the aim i have for the bill the house kindly indulge my half hour speech cover the issue and member across the house offer various constructive comment that have lead to further improvement and clarification through amendment that i be able to secure in committee i be not intend to speak for quite as long today but i think the whip be encourage i to do so so i will indulge the house a little long 
 we enjoy a comprehensive and informed debate on reading thank to suggestion from that debate specifically from my hon friend   the member for bury north james daly   and   the hon member for reading east matt rodda the bill be amend in committee and now explicitly state that a high street can be designate to cover not just road but a collection of adjoining street that be consider locally to be a high street area by virtue of the cluster of high street purpose serve by those street 
 it be an important improvement to the bill that it now specifically confirm that flexibility which have only weakly be implicit in the right to vary designation and not explicit in make they in the place my aim have always be that the bill should be demand but not onerous it seek to co ordinate exist workstream well rather than add to net burden and its provision be deliberately as flexible as possible it be vital for local community to celebrate and preserve their local point of difference all those thing that make their particular high street a special place to be for resident and visitor alike 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech on an excellent bill do he agree that the history and heritage of our town centre can be what really mark they out as different basingstoke be often see as a new town which could not be further from the truth it have a year old market and be the birthplace of jane austen the world ’s great novelist do he agree that we should be make more of that history in our town centre 
 i thank my right hon friend for that excellent point and i entirely agree that heritage that historical character of our high street in particular in many of our town and city right across the country be so important and we need to make more of that heritage particularly when think about attract new us to our high street many of those heritage property can be convert into excellent space for a whole range of new us attract footfall and new business to the high street 
 as i be say the bill be also about ensure that local authority conform to a national requirement and that they undertake the process of designation review and improvement in accordance with their local circumstance with assistance from national dataset and good practice analysis that already exist and can be signpost through the secretary of state ’s guidance get the balance right between local difference and national requirement be a concern it be clear from colleague that the original bill which specify that the local authority should designate no more than high street be not get the balance right and that the maximum number of high street designate in each area should be a decision for each local authority that change be secure in committee if local authority wish to fund designation and review in addition to the that will be fund by government they now can do so 
 of course there will be numerous disagreement around which area to designate as high street and when my own area be a city make up of town and there be many other high street right across north staffordshire there may well be spirited debate locally about how to improve they there will even be disagreement i be sure about what the secretary of state ’s guidance should include and what central funding if any should be available this bill set out a supportive and predictable framework in which such debate can and must take place bring the focus and direction that our high street desperately need 
 the bill directly address a problem highlight in december by the levelling up housing and communities committee in its excellent report support our high street after covid-19 namely the absence of a plan for ensure that local authority have a capacity   to develop effective place partnership and place leadership the bill introduce the mechanism of designation and review under guidance and this be support with national funding for up to improvement plan that will be develop in partnership locally lead by local authority 
 i completely understand the reaction that local government often have when it feel as though it be be tell it need to do more my background be at the coalface of local government policymake that be why i stress that the bill seek to get local government not so much to do more as to co ordinate what it do well with wide input and agreement and a wide contribution of effort in implementation and delivery from a range of interested partner in our high street range from community group to our high street business i be enthuse by those authority that can already see the benefit of have an improvement plan and i be pleased that the money resolution mean that the authority that have be hold back by the cost of formulate a plan will have that barrier remove 
 the bill provide the policymake structure for motivate action in the use of the many power that already exist and be at the disposal of local authority and in give well accountability as to their use the bill ensure that our community and high street business be empower to call for the improvement that should be outline in each plan 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech on a brilliant bill that will make such a huge difference do he agree that the bill will also give more power to local people who will be able to hold their local council its cabinet and their local leader to account if they be not do exactly what the bill ’s objective set out people can vote they out and bring in a new council that will ensure that its local high street be manage properly and people be give the power they need to grow the local economy 
 i thank my hon friend for those kind word of support she rightly say that this be about accountability and ensure that the people in our local community be in charge of their high street and can ensure that those authority which have the power to bring about change be hold to account for that and for their decision 
 section enforcement notice and other enforcement mechanism will certainly be part of that mix unfortunately section power which be about enforcement where property be in a bad condition and owner be not take responsibility for their building have not be use in our area i make a freedom of information request recently about that and we find out that stoke on trent city council have not use those power once in the past month that be shocking give the blatant need for a carrot and stick approach to address some of the concern about our high street 
 change of use will also be another aspect of this and have furth review every year ensure that improvement plan be live nimble and able to respond to change view and circumstance nor should we presume that a plan could consider every eventuality so although it will be important to give consideration to improvement plan as part of local planning policy   they should not restrict and prevent positive development that may not have be envisage when a plan be formulate 
 additionally review can happen more frequently than every year if necessary again that be far clarify through amendment in committee importantly the bill do not prescribe that improvement plan must be fully implement complete and whole within year i want to clear up any confusion that there may still be about that rather the bill provide for plan to be more of a moveable feast subject to periodic review to check on the progress towards delivery of what might be call an ideal model envisage that mean that improvement plan can include long term ambition guide principle and characteristic for high street well into the decade ahead with the ability to finesse those at least every year 
 of course there be the duty not to leave the plan cover dust on a shelf have a long term vision that be deliver incrementally with maintain local support be the right thing to do we can all think of example of fund pot become available for so call shovel ready scheme and many of we will have be frustrate when it turn out that nothing remotely shovel ready be on the book 
 of the great lesson of the high street taskforce which have be usefully embrace by a number of local authority include longton be the importance of get a number of quick win and a number of deliverable scheme within the short term and have a long term vision and series of project the high street taskforce have be an important and productive initiative for local council of all colour and i hope that its legacy finding and good practice will live on through the bill it be work that deserve to be celebrate and continue and we should all be grateful for the wealth of knowledge that the taskforce have contribute the bill be necessary to institutionalise that legacy far develop it across local government and local community have an improvement plan will help provide the basis for help secure future funding provide a more cohesive plan to help justify investment decision and will mean that certain scheme can be on the book whenever the funding be available it also mean that other project that crop up can be knit into the fabric to align well with the long term strategic vision and priority for an area 
 without a clear vision of what a preserved and enhance high street area would look like i suggest that the spending would not be as optimal as it could or should be and the funding may not even be win at all much of the focus for government investment would be well inform and would deliver well value for money through high street improvement plan indeed local authority and place partnership will be able to engage with national body to push for certain optimal scheme or the refinement of they to help deliver great benefit for our high street within the spending envelope that could mean infrastructure project such as with organisation like network rail and national highways environmental enhancement from organisation like the environment agency or major housing delivery on some of our brownfield through organisation like homes england it be important that we improve the linkage of national organisation to well understand   the need of our local community and high street improvement plan can help do that through well co ordination and clarity of direction 
 high street improvement plan may also be important for historic england in identify area in need of a partnership scheme in conservation area know as psica the review of high street will in some case draw on conservation area appraisal as well in some of those case that will expose the absence of appraisal and will help fill the gap particularly where condition of those area be poor it have be exciting to work with historic england in longton to help save building on market street and the heritage action zone funding we have secure have help deliver on some of those building however it have not deliver on all those building and we actually have a number of building that be still in a poor state we have amass knowledge and datum about the ownership and condition of some of those building and we need to move on to the next stage i hope we will secure some additional funding for longton through the heritage lottery fund to help improve and continue some of the good work already start through the psica scheme 
 there be much more work to do especially in ensure that the traffic flow and public realm be optimise for footfall and dwell time in longton town centre i hope the use of some of the levelling up partnership funding for the town centre will help also some of the other plan that we have be develop particularly around thing like crime and antisocial behaviour be important for many of our high street and town centre longton have recently see a spate of absolutely mindless crime and antisocial behaviour target a number of retailer in the next few week i will be meet a number of they alongside staffordshire police to discuss some of the issue 
 i have be absolutely delighted to help secure more funding to address some of those issue work with our fantastic police fire and crime commissioner ben adams we manage to secure extra safer streets funding for longton and for other part of staffordshire and stoke on trent to help deliver the improvement and create the secure high street we need to see in our case they include additional cctv throughout the town centre and gate off some of the alleyway that have attract crime and antisocial behaviour those measure will help to ensure that people feel safe to visit and encourage more people to dwell and shop on our high street 
 only a comprehensive improvement plan can pull together the many factor and aspect that need proper co ordination for a compelling high street experience all that can be address in the guidance from the secretary of state i hope there will be a role for the office for place now base in stoke on trent in optimise the guidance and it will be guidance not prescription i stress here that the bill do not remove the power of article direction that local authority already enjoy to remove permit development right if they see fit that be a decision for they and it will no doubt be part of the designation process to consider any pdr issue around a high street in many area permit development right will actually be key to the enterprise spirit need to revive high street forward thinking council know full well that they can not succeed in their regeneration ambition if they allow themselves to have a reputation among developer of council say no 
 the improvement plan process will ensure that authority be comfortable as enablers of preservation and enhancement we be bless in staffordshire like in many part of the country and particularly in north staffordshire to have many iconic high street whether in the more rural market town of stone and cheadle or in the pottery town of fenton and longton that make up part of the city of stoke on trent but nearly all of they across the country have face multiple challenge from online out of town and of course covid-19 
 to conclude we must act to address that decline build on the work already be do by the government through measure such as those set out in the levelling up and regeneration act and ensure the power in place have a high likelihood of be utilise it have be a pleasure to bring the bill forward and to work with colleague across all party to discuss it review it and improve it on its passage through the house we all want to see our high street review and improve we want they to be preserve and enhance to celebrate their local character we want great footfall drive by high street that be safe and pleasant place to be the bill ensure that local authority work with property owner local community and many other to realise that aim accord to their own local circumstance it be muscular localism and i commend it to the house 
 i congratulate   the hon member for stoke on trent south jack brereton   on bring forward such an important bill i think every member of this house will have a problem high street that they feel frustrated about and can not get any work do on i hope he will allow i to talk about the success in my constituency which i think echo the sentiment of the bill and show what can be do when some of the thing he want to see in the bill be achieve 
 i want to talk about my hometown of north shields north shields be probably well know for the fish quay the fish quay be a shadow of its former self in way but because of a lot of work that have be do on development it be now thrive it be full of restaurant and shop and we have the fantastic north shields fishermen ’s heritage project which have do a lot to highlight and record the history of our town next year north shields will be celebrate its anniversary i live in north shields from when i be bear until i be we live in an upstairs tyneside flat and then when i be my family be thrill to move to another great area of north tyneside wallsend into a brand new council house when we still have council house be build on a grand scale that be so we can work out my age 
 north shields have high street the that run parallel to the river east west be saville street the that run north south be bedford street as in many other town centre there have be so much decline over the year various scheme have try to bring the town centre back to life but there have always be reason why it have not really thrive town centre and high street be so important because they bring community together with friend and family shopping and meeting in the same area when i be young we go shop on a saturday and we would not get very far along the   high street before our mother see a relative or friend and there would be little group of people chat and go in and out of the shop our high street be great community space go to high street now be very sad however because there be no life in they people be just go into the shop or might gather to speak to each other but that buzz have definitely go 
 however north tyneside council develop a masterplan for the north shields area do exactly what the hon member for stoke on trent south mention bring community together to talk about what they want what have help with that be that there have be fund north shields have nearly £ for a transport hub and a new town square to transform the town make it attractive and family friendly again with a vibrant high quality high street feel 
 the transport hub open last september and i be pleased to be there to see that happen it be amazing the money that help transform it the hon member for stoke on trent south will be able to mention this as an example come from the transform cities fund which come via transport north east with help from the north of tyne combined authority and north tyneside council as a proud former council member i will never fail to sing the praise of the great labour north tyneside council 
 the transport hub be a major part of north tyneside ’s ambitious plan to improve north shields what be really fantastic about the hub be the public toilet which be a vital part of any town centre and high street in the past because of antisocial behaviour a lot of public toilet be closed and shop do not always have toilet that people can use some people with medical condition really need to know that there will be a toilet in the vicinity when they go out i know someone with prostate cancer this example be from my family experience who carry a card that they can show to access a toilet if no public toilet be available but people do not want to have to do that they want a bit more dignity and not to have to search around for a toilet 
 the new bus station ’s toilet facility be fantastic there be individual cubicle each with their own toilet and sink everything be self contain i take the bus from wallsend to north shields and so far the facility be be well maintain we might worry about what happen to such facility in the town centre but people be show pride and that be the key thing the difference be that there be now pride in the town centre
