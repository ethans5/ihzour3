it be clear that we be today debate methodology rather than value certainly i do not dispute the minister ’s value at all we all want to see the grow need meet and the environment protect the question that we be debate today be the good methodology for achieve those outcome i have submit a number of amendment cover area which i will rattle through as quickly as i can all of which support the theme that my hon friend   the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos   advance today and indeed that he have pursue in committee in previous week 
 amendment relate to housing target it propose allow local authority to adopt target that reduce housing need rather than simply target to build home house building target be in many area part of the problem rather than the solution to housing need for example since the 1960 cornwall ’s housing stock have be among the fast growing in the united kingdom it have almost treble yet housing problem for local people have get significantly bad over that time 
 simply set house building target result in massive hope value be attach to every single community around cornwall have work as a chief executive of a charity that try to build affordable home i can say that establish house building target make it more difficult to address the housing need of local people target that be about reduce need would change the dynamic of the planning system in place that face these problem 
 unfortunately the approach to house building target that have be adopt by party over the previous decade be build on the delusion that private developer will collude with government to drive down the price of their finished product we can no long carry on in that delusion we can not and should not pursue counterproductive methodology amendment and new clause be consequential on the fundamental change propose in amendment 
 my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington have speak about introduce a new class order to address the prevalence of non permanent occupancy in some area the previous government be look at bring in a new class order for holiday let but that should be extend to home and all home of non permanent occupancy new clause which be consequential on new clause propose introduce a sunset clause for planning permission to ensure that   there be not a perverse incentive for people to apply to change a property ’s use in order to enhance the value of their property when they sell it this be not about the politic of envy but the politic of social justice i think those who represent area or constituency with large number of home properly understand how these thing operate 
 finally i table a number of amendment relate to affordability include new clause on affordable development and new clause new clause would prohibit cross subsidy or at least open market development on rural exception site those site should not be call rural exception site they should be call rural norm site that should be the methodology for deliver affordable home in rural area it should be drive by want to have affordable home in such location 
 i be pleased to support this important bill and the government amendment to it which will deliver the housing infrastructure and environmental protection that my constituent need 
 i welcome the government ’s enhancement to the environmental delivery plan they provide great clarity legal safeguard and appropriate flexibility to ensure that the plan restore and enhance our precious natural habitat the current piecemeal approach to offset environmental harm be not work the government ’s sensible approach maintain exist protection for nature and add to they with the ability to fund high impact strategic nature recovery project i be very lucky that   there be several significant nature recovery project in my constituency such as sulham wood and meadow which i have the pleasure of visit last week this project be maximise biodiversity on hectare of marginal arable land and be plant tree km of new hedgerow and a new walnut orchard we need more big project like this 
 i would like to highlight the opportunity the bill present for our country ’s chalk stream i be proud to represent a constituency that boast many wonderful waterway include the entire length of the river pang a beautiful wind chalk stream that be a point of local pride it be say to be the inspiration for the wind in the willow and it be love by family dog walker and angler alike but the precious pang be in crisis in just a few short year the water quality have plummet to poor citizen scientist and angler test the river such as professor mike wilson and pete devery consistently report sample with completely unacceptable level of phosphate and e. coli the phosphate pollution from thames water sewage work be so bad that luminous green from the resultant algae can be see in satellite image 
 i thank all the campaigner citizen scientist and volunteer with whom i have be work throughout my campaign to restore the pang i also thank the arc project the rivers trust the angling trust pang valley flood forum and berks bucks and oxon wildlife trust as well as all member of the pang flagship chalk stream partnership which support a range of initiative to restore the pang they be all dedicated advocate whose restoration effort be make a real difference chalk stream be rare and valuable habitat their mineral rich stable water be home to a plethora of specie 
 i almost always agree with my hon friend so the answer be yes he also provide i with an opportunity to clarify a point that have not be cover in the last hour or so the payment will continue not to be exportable for those not resident in the uk 
 the vice chamberlain of the household report to the house that his majesty have be attend with its address of july be pleased to receive the same very graciously and give the follow answer 
 i have receive with great satisfaction the dutiful and loyal expression of your thank for the speech with which i open the present session of parliament 
 i have receive your humble address pray that i should re appoint john pullinger cb as the chair of the electoral commission with effect from   may   for the period end on   april i will comply with your request 
 i have receive your humble address pray that i should appoint paula sussex cbe to the office of parliamentary commissioner for administration and health service commissioner for england i will comply with your request 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to help prevent new unitary authority from require exceptional financial support 
 local government reorganisation will lead to well outcome for resident and save a significant amount of money that can be reinveste in public service and improve accountability it be for council to develop robust financially sustainable proposal that be in the good interest of their whole area 
 the rushed local government reorganisation mean that waverley borough in my area will be force to join other authority that be debt ride such as woking what will the secretary of state do to ensure that resident in my area do not pay a financial price for the woe of other authority 
 as set out in the invitation letter and as with previous restructure there be no proposal for council debt to be address centrally or write off as part of reorganisation but the government accept that woking and thurrock council hold significant unsupported debt that can not be manage locally in its entirety we have commit to provide an initial amount of debt repayment support for these council in ahead of the reorganisation this be unprecedented government support 
 i have be contact by constituent who be concern by medium comment over the last week that suggest that the planning and infrastructure bill may render site of special scientific interest protection meaningless will the secretary of state clarify the bill ’s position on this and outline what protection there will be for sssi like lodge hill in my constituency with its important nightingale population 
 i be sure that those on the conservative benches have an interest in area of natural beauty as well and i be sure that the minister for housing and planning will address this point when we discuss the planning and infrastructure bill later today we take natural beauty and history seriously and we think that the bill will be able to do nature recovery and enable we to build the house that we desperately need 
 order i remind member to look at the question on the order paper and make sure that their supplementary question be relate to it 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 the government continue to progress the implementation of the reform to the leasehold system that be already in statute while at the same time undertake the work require to bring forward the wide set of reform necessary to end the feudal leasehold system for good we remain on track to deliver our ambitious leasehold and commonhold reform agenda as set out in the write ministerial statement that i make on   november   last year 
 i thank the minister for his positive engagement with i on the issue of a safe crossing at road on the wynyard and queensgate estate in my constituency but can i also bring to his attention the issue of service charge at the willow sage court estate   do he agree that our leasehold reform must ensure fair service charge i can send he further information about this case if he wish 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point and i would like further information on that case the government recognise the considerable financial strain that rise service charge place on leaseholder and tenant overcharge through service charge be completely unacceptable we intend to consult in the very near future on the measure in the leasehold and freehold reform act design to drive up the transparency of service charge to make they more easily challengeable if leaseholder consider they to be unreasonable 
 i congratulate the government on the bold action they be take to end the feudal leasehold system for good which will ensure that future flat owner will never again be treat as class homeowner but as the minister be well aware there be million of exist leaseholder include thousand in my constituency of hendon will he update the house on the work the department be do build on the path forward outline in the commonhold white paper to strengthen protection for exist leaseholder include on the conversion of leasehold ground rent and right to manage 
 the government remain committed to provide exist leaseholder with great right power and protection over their home we commence the right to manage measure contain in the leasehold and freehold reform act on   march we remain firmly committed to tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent and we will deliver that in legislation we will set out further detail on our propose approach to enable the conversion of exist leasehold to commonhold in our draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill later this year 
 inflation bust estate management fee for little or no service plague resident across the country include those of the brackenleigh greymoor meadows and denton mill estate in my carlisle constituency what assurance can the minister give my constituent and those of other hon member that the government ’s action will curb those atrocious practice by estate management company 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point i recognise that many hon member across the house be affect by this issue the government remain committed to protect residential freeholder on private and mixed tenure housing estate from unfair charge we will consult this year on implement the leasehold and freehold reform act ’s new consumer protection provision for the million of home subject to the charge affect my hon friend ’s constituent and we will bring measure into force as quickly as possible thereafter 
 i be glad to see the government start to tackle some of these issue will the minister assure i that people on freehold housing estate with covenant issue in place like basildon and billericay will also be include   in any legislation they often face service charge increase of ten of per cent every single year and they need that same assurance be provide to leaseholder that the government will think about that and take action 
 i assure the right hon gentleman that the government be think about the plight of residential freeholder alongside leaseholder as i just say we will consult this year on implement the provision in the act which provide those residential freeholder with new consumer protection provision they will have that immediate safety to come in as we look at how we reduce the prevalence of such arrangement in the long term 
 leaseholder at south view on upperton road in eastbourne face an extortionate bill of up to £ each to repair unsafe balcony the communication from morgans and stredder pearce who be both responsible for fix that have be woeful and delay be lead to cost spiral far will the minister urge those organisation to improve the speed and responsiveness of their communication to protect south view ’s leaseholder from further cost 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that case i recognise the problem that he allude to we want to bring in as soon as possible measure to standardise service charge in particular and make they more transparent i wonder if he might write to i and the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris who be responsible for build safety with detail of that case so that we can look into it far 
 developer be now create facility and management company with new homeowner and tenant find themselves as shareholder without their consent will the minister look at that issue across the country to protect those homeowner 
 if i have understand the hon gentleman correctly he point to how a variety of arrangement can be put in place under freehold estate we need to capture that variety across the country that be of the challenge in look at what measure we might bring forward to reduce the prevalence of such arrangement and we certainly intend to do that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the last government pass the leasehold and freehold reform act support by the then opposition labour say in the king ’s speech that it would go far with reform and quickly then the minister say that would take the whole of this parliament now the secondary legislation need as well as the consultation pende mean that leaseholder be unlikely to see any reform quickly last week the government say that primary legislation may now be need without implement the law already pass be that not just another example of the government promise thing but now flail around delay and break key promise they make while leaseholder across the country suffer 
 i must say that the shadow minister be develop a bit of a habit here he seem to have conflate a number of separate issue the government have a very clear commitment to end the feudal leasehold system within this parliament that require a wide set of reform than switch on the power that be already on the statute book via the act though we be go to do that and be do so at pace if he care to look at the write ministerial statement where i set all this out in a lot of detail he would see that we remain on track with implement our reform agenda 
 if she will make an assessment of the adequacy of the funding model for the repair of council housing stock 
 the government recognise the strain place on housing revenue account as a result of change in rent policy inflationary pressure and increase cost associate with invest in exist stock the principle of self financing remain the right but we be commit to work with council to overcome the pressure on their hra so that they can invest in new and exist stock 
 will the minister join i in praise swindon borough council for its fantastic vision in invest in fix our council stock something the previous conservative administration fail to do for year 
 i certainly will my hon friend be a fantastic champion for council housing and highlight that swindon borough council be put significant investment into its housing stock over the next year the government recognise that council like other register provider need support to build their capacity that be why we consult last year on a new year social housing rent settlement and have allow council to keep of the receipt generate by right to buy sale we will set out detail of further investment in the forthcoming spending review 
 in kendal on friday afternoon i come across a constituent in a home housing property who have be the victim of a house fire several month ago although they be still live in the property it have not be fully restore or fix i be on the matter personally and deal with the casework issue if i share the detail of this case with the minister will he take a personal interest in it and do he agree that it be outrageous for someone to have to live in a fire damage property for month without it be properly restore 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that case it do sound outrageous if he write to i i will certainly look into the matter far 
 what step she be take to support high street 
 what step she be take to support high street 
 what step she be take to support high street 
 the government be commit to rejuvenate high street by empower local community through the £ plan for neighbourhood we be provide flexible funding to support our most challenge community we be also tackle vacancy with high street rental auction and legislate for a new community right to buy to support community ownership 
 heswall in my wirral west constituency be a brilliant place to live and deserve a thriving high street but unfortunately for too many year now beloved shop have close and decline have feel inevitable the people of heswall deserve well i appreciate the minister ’s answer but will he go far in explain exactly how my constituent can take back control of their high street so that it can thrive once again and deliver growth and opportunity for they 
 this government understand the unique challenge that heswall face include as a coastal community that be why we be drive power and funding out of westminster to ensure that no community be leave behind just last week my right hon friend the chancellor announce £ in funding for the liverpool city region include £ to upgrade the bus network which be vital for connectivity to my hon friend ’s community i understand that those upgrade will begin in the wirral next year and i encourage wirral council as i do all local authority to take advantage of the new power the government have introduce to reoccupy the empty shop that be such a blight on our high street 
 i be elect to this place on the back of a pledge to revitalise the town in my constituency with the high street in st austell in a sorry state i be delighted to have be able to take the step towards revitalise it by end the impasse at the site of the now derelict general wolfe pub and move my constituency office back into town at the other end of the street however the fact remain that the high street be on its knee and many resident feel that our once great town could do much well what step be the minister take to ensure that significant resource be available beyond just the plan for neighbourhood to revitalise town in constituency like mine 
 i can say to my hon friend ’s constituent that he be make good on that election commitment because we have have this conversation on multiple occasion like all future funding the government will set out their long term vision for local growth at the multi year spending review but in this year the recently communicate uk share prosperity fund announcement include more than £ for cornwall and the isles of scilly a mixture of revenue and capital funding to ensure that place can get go and kick start economic growth locally bring town such as his into play 
 in my sherwood forest constituency high street be the beat heart of town such as ollerton and hucknall ollerton be set to receive record funding from this labour government and i thank the minister for that however hucknall be badly let down by the previous government with false promise of funding that quite simply do not exist will he meet i to discuss how this labour government can support the future of hucknall enable it to be the glorious high street it once be 
 i fully share my hon friend ’s anger about the unfunded commitment to hucknall from the previous government i know how disappointing that have be locally i be pleased we have be able to reprioritise some funding within extremely tight budget to give the support that she talk about as she know i live only tram stop from hucknall and of course i would be keen to pop on the tram and see she and if we meet in the plough i would be doubly keen either way i will be make sure i get to see she 
 in i meet parent of child with severe disability in my constituency a lack of suitable toilet and change facility make it almost impossible for those family to enjoy a day out and i have be inspire to campaign for more change place toilet ever since i recently open a change place toilet just off leyburn high street which will improve accessibility across wensleydale will the minister join i in thank everyone involve and commit to support more change place toilet across the country so that family can have both the opportunity and the dignity that they deserve 
 i share the right hon gentleman ’s enthusiasm for change place toilet which have their root in nottingham frankly people will not be able to access the amenity on their high street if they do not feel they can leave their home without those facility i share his enthusiasm and commend he and his community he sell himself slightly short however because i recall that when he be a minister in this department he change the rule and building regulation to make it easy to develop such toilet and as chancellor he make funding available for more as well i would like to take this opportunity to recognise that and to praise he and the community of wensleydale 
 house in multiple occupation throughout broxbourne on our high street in particular be cause my constituent lot of issue what will the minister do to review the power that my local council of east herts and broxbourne have to stop hmo where we do not want they 
 this be a really important question the future mix of our high street will undoubtably include yes traditional retail but also leisure and accommodation that footfall can be a good thing but if this be not well planned or well organise and if community be not bring along it will not succeed i be conscious that we have the planning and infrastructure bill proceeding ahead of we today and i be sure the hon gentleman will find an opportunity to make that case to the minister for housing and planning 
 in surrey heath business will contribute more than £ in business rate to surrey borough council but because of central government tariffing only of those business rate will be retain locally there be a reasonable expectation that locally raise taxis should remain local so with local government reorganisation on its way could the secretary of state and the front bench team reassure surrey heath business that they might have a chance of retain more of those business rate that should be invest back into our high street 
 the hon gentleman will be aware of the change we have make to ensure that there be discount on business rate for certain business this year with further commitment to come at the budget he make the right point of course i can not announce that outside the budget but we will consider those point carefully 
 i call the shadow minister 
 our high street and small business have be hammer by this government with big increase in the cost of business rate and national insurance contribution can the minister tell the house what measure he and the team have put forward to the chancellor of the exchequer to help our small business and high street in the spending review 
 the hon gentleman offer i opportunity there we talk about challenge on the high street but i remind the house of the more than a decade of starve demand because the economic policy of the conservatives and all the impact that have follow by—[interruption the stag do on the opposition front bench be make their rattle as usual but they be all present during that disastrous fiscal event that lead to the increase cost that we be still cop with now the temptation the hon gentleman give i be the opportunity to resign by leak detail of the spending review here sadly i will give no succour there 
 every high street need a chorley market that be the answer 
 what step she be take to ensure that new home meet the minimum standard of   epc   c   rating 
 the december uplift to energy efficiency standard mean that most new build home already achieve epc rating of a or b. as recently announce the government intend to introduce future standard in the autumn that will set more ambitious energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement for new home to ensure that they be net ready 
 as well as energy water be an important utility in ely and east cambridgeshire we suffer drought and flood what be the minister do to encourage new build to have proper rainwater harvesting and dual piping so that we can use rainwater to flush our toilet and for other non drinking water us 
 we be look at how we might make household water use more efficient as well as a range of other intervention in my hon friend ’s part of the country to ensure that we make the good use of water and that the necessary infrastructure be put in place to accommodate housing growth 
 in hartlepool exist home have an energy performance certificate rating of d or below that mean too many home be too cold and have bill that be too high what can the minister do to accelerate the improvement of those home to ensure warm home for hartlepool constituent 
 my hon friend tempt i into the responsibility of another department but i will get the relevant minister from the department for energy security and net to write to he to set out what measure be be put in place as part of the warm home plan 
 in just of home have an epc c rating or above so those home be too cold and have bill that be too high it be by when we leave power will the minister share with the house the ambition and give we a number for the percentage of home that we should expect to have that basic epc c rating by the end of this term which i hope will be the only the minister have so he should make a difference while he can laughter 
 that ’ a bit harsh 
 the right hon gentleman be certainly not charitable as i make clear i recognise the december uplift in energy efficiency standard mean that most new build that come through achieve an epc rating of a or b. off the top of my head though i stand to be correct i think about of new home meet those standard but as i say we have announce that we want to introduce future standard this autumn which will drive even more ambitious energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement for new home 
 have long campaign on the need for much tough regulation for solar panel on new home i be delighted to hear the government announce last friday that we will bring forward requirement to do exactly that that will not just boost epc rating but save new homeowner thousand of pound in bill all while reduce energy usage how can we ensure that we move at speed so that as many of the new home we build over the course of this parliament as possible will benefit from our ambition here 
 my hon friend have be a champion of ensure that we get more solar panel on to new build home and other type of building as i say in answer to a previous question we want to move at pace to put future standard in place we be look at this autumn and that will ensure more of the new home come forward meet those more ambitious standard it will mean as he be aware that the vast majority of new build home have solar panel on they as standard 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of uk government regeneration funding on town in scotland 
 the government ’s define mission be deliver economic growth and drive up living standard that be why we be invest up to £ across scottish town over year to support regeneration tackle inequality and unleash their full potential that will empower local community improve public service and create new opportunity that be of course alongside the share prosperity fund which be invest £ in fife this year 
 many time i have raise with the minister as well as with business and treasury ministers the need for regeneration funding for kirkcaldy high street the brilliant people of our town deserve a modern town centre that make the most of our incredible seafront and all it have to offer ahead of the spending review this week can the minister assure i that my message have be hear will he also join i in congratulate davy russell labour ’s new msp and a strong campaigner for his high street the people of hamilton larkhall and stonehouse have choose well 
 i can assure the hon lady her constituent and the house that i do not think a week have go by without she push i on kirkcaldy town centre she know that i can not run ahead of any multi year spending review that may be upon we soon but the point she make and always make to i be a good i of course associate myself with her comment about davy 
 rise 
 order i will just say that supplementary question should aim to relate to the original question this be about funding in scotland so i be sure that the hon gentleman ’s question will be purely about that 
 the minister be right to point out the need for regeneration for town in scotland last week the government agree in this chamber to fund for england and wales that leave only part of the united kingdom leave out northern ireland laughter what will be do to ensure that northern ireland get the same as the other administration 
 just answer the scotland bit please minister 
 the hon gentleman know that i talk with my counterpart in all the devolved government include scotland and northern ireland and i will continue to do so the shared prosperity fund be a sign of our commitment in that direction we will i be sure see future plan shortly 
 whether her department be take step with independent training college to train construction sector specialist apprentice to support house building target 
 the government recognise the need to expand and upskill the construction workforce to meet our ambitious plan for change milestone of deliver safe and decent home in this parliament we be work closely with industry to provide high quality house building training opportunity and we welcome the £ industry investment late last year in pioneer new home building skill hub which will create up to more construction apprenticeship per year 
 the construction skill village in scarborough be an innovative real world training environment for the specialist trade that we desperately need to build home do the minister acknowledge the importance of independent training provider in our plan to build new home and will he meet i to discuss how we can ensure that itp which deliver the specialist skill that the construction industry be ask for be include in our plan to train new construction worker 
 the government be invest significant amount of money to train more construction worker we appreciate fully the importance of independent training provider in train the workforce need to deliver more home across england i suggest that my hon friend and i find time to meet baroness smith from the department for education to discuss matter relate to itp include the csv in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 i welcome the minister ’s commitment to support skill training in the construction sector do he agree that skill training need to be particularly focus on the sustainable skill and will he join i in congratulate the low carbon technology training centre in my constituency as well as the new university in hereford its cohort of engineer graduate just last month do he welcome such initiative and will the government put more funding into support the construction and engineering skill that our building sector will need 
 i hope that the hon lady recognise that we be put significant amount of investment into construction skill in the spring statement the government announce a £ investment that will recruit an additional construction worker by i be more than happy to recognise the contribution make by initiative of the sort that she mention in her constituency we absolutely need skill across the build environment to meet our target 
 if she will take step through the spending review to increase social housing supply 
 what step she be take to build more social and affordable home 
 in our month in office we have announce £ in new funding for the affordable home programme and £ as a down payment on future investment the previous government hand back precious cash for social and affordable home this government will get those home build the chancellor will set out detail of new investment at the spending review 
 i very much welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to social and affordable housing i know that she will be concern by the new analysis by the national housing federation which find that local authority in england with the most severe shortage of social housing now have waiting list exceed year for a family sized social home with nearly people on the waiting list in salford alone will she outline what support she will give local authority and the social housing sector to deliver desperately need social home 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we have a housing crisis in this country and it be feel particularly acutely by those who need social and council housing that be why we have be absolutely clear that we want to deliver the big increase to social and affordable housing in a generation we have already outline a number of measure include allow council to retain of right to buy receipt and make long term funding settlement for rent we have set out the investment that we have put into the sector but we will say more at the spending review 
 have access to a safe and secure home be a basic human need but the tories absolutely ignore this when they cut government funding by £ in just year and derby have suffer the consequence last year waiting list for social housing in our city reach record high what step be the secretary of state take to lift people stick on these waiting list out of limbo and into good social housing 
 my hon friend be a great champion for derby and many member across this house can understand the acute pressure he mention the fact be we have not be build enough home and we certainly have not be build enough social home therefore we have already set out some step as i mention briefly early around the right to buy receipt and we be consult on new long term rent settlement to give provider confidence to build and we will be invest billion of pound into social housing i can not pre empt the spending review this week but the chancellor will set out more then 
 when a developer pledge to build minimum of affordable housing and obtain outline planning permission on the basis of that pledge and then less than month later seek to reduce the to be that acceptable 
 i be not go to stray into individual case but what i will say be that since gain office this government have confirm the change to the national planning policy framework in particular around   section to ensure that when developer seek planning permission and pledge that they be go to do something they be keep to those pledge 
 my constituency be see approximately new home be build across the basildon and thurrock area basildon hospital be consistently run at capacity and a school i visit today which i be very proud to see in such a good state have roughly pupil application for available space each year along with housing my constituent be deeply concerned about the level of infrastructure be develop and the state of the exist infrastructure what reassurance can minister give they about those concern 
 come back to the point that we do need housing include social and council housing we have be clear in the change that we have be make include in the planning and infrastructure bill to ensure that that infrastructure be there because that be of the barrier lead to people reject some proposal because the transport connectivity and the facility be not available therefore this government be commit to ensure we get the right type of development that support local need and also importantly have the infrastructure alongside it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the deputy prime minister have repeatedly stick to her commitment that home include social home will be build over the lifetime of this parliament despite everybody know that she will not achieve it and today the late people to say she will not are savills who have forecast that the true number she will build over this parliament be just and that mean few social home too now that she have emerge from the dark room of the treasury to capitulate to the chancellor will the deputy prime minister confirm that more social home and new home will be build by the end of this parliament yes or no 
 the opposition can not have it both way way they be say we be fail to build the home and the other way they be say we be concrete over the green belt we say that planning reform alone will not deliver our ambition which be why we have commit to deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in a generation and i say to the hon member as i have say to many people in my life underestimate i at your peril 
 i call the liberal democrats spokesperson 
 jess in my constituency have all her possession and bag put on the pavement outside the hotel and be lock out of her bedroom with her baby by hotel management shock behaviour on their part with £ be spend by local authority on temporary accommodation would it not be well to have a national target for the number of social home that be go to be build what step will the government be take to set such a target 
 i be disgusted to hear about what happen to that young person and her baby that be absolutely terrible the number of people particularly child who be in temporary accommodation at the moment be shocking which be why this government be commit to the big wave of social and affordable housing in a generation we have not put a particular number on that not least because we do not have the spending review result they be come later this week but we be clear that we want that number to ramp up and we need that proportion to meet the target of new home so i ask the hon member to wait just a little bit long 
 what progress her department have make on provide adequate funding for local authority as part of the fair funding review 
 what step her department be take to help ensure that council be financially stable 
 what step her department be take to help ensure that council be financially stable 
 what step her department be take to ensure that council in area with high level of deprivation receive adequate funding 
 the government have deliver a settlement that begin to fix the foundation and make available over £ in in an improved approach will direct funding where it be need most and provide certainty through the multi year settlement in over a decade 
 leicestershire alongside other authority have be campaign for fair funding in recent year follow year of poor funding settlement by the last government mean cut to vital service a lack of fair funding also mean that school in north west leicestershire have some of the low level of funding per student in the country how will the minister approach a fair funding settlement that consider the unique challenge face by rural community 
 i thank my hon friend for her work in champion those issue we be fundamentally reform how we assess council relative need and resource to ensure that funding be distribute to where it be need most that include account for council ability to raise resource locally which the previous government promise to do but ultimately fail to do in balance the number target funding in that way will enable council that have have to scale back service the most to be able to catch up and to ensure that everybody across the whole of england be able to access decent public service 
 despite an increase in council tax of since £ in exceptional financial support this year and brutal cut to service croydon council ’s finance remain broken as an outer london borough with inner london problem croydon have historically not receive the funding it need to cover the cost for demand lead service like temporary accommodation so even if croydon ’s debt be wipe out it would still need exceptional financial support will the minister outline how council like croydon will get the resource they need to meet the complex challenge they face and provide the frontline service that our community deserve 
 the question that have be raise demonstrate why the fair funding review be need and why it have to take into account all the different factor that have an impact on whether council can provide good public service or not i appreciate understand and accept that pressure that be previously feel in inner london be now feel in outer london and in rural area too my hon friend will know that in february we provide £ in efs support for croydon council and we will continue to work with it we have meet and talk about the issue a number of time and i know that she understand that those be not small problem to deal with 
 the statutory override to special educational need and disability deficit come to an end in just month without a plan from the government for the end of the statutory override more than half of all local education authority face effective bankruptcy the need for a resolution to the issue be now long overdue when do the minister expect to be able to give local authority the certainty they need 
 we be lay the groundwork now ahead of the provisional settlement which will be the multi year settlement in over a decade and will deal with a lot of the structural issue if it be any help the government understand and accept that it be not right or acceptable for council that have do everything that have be ask of they and provide good public service particularly for young people to find themselves at the financial cliff edge as a result we have an absolute commitment to work through those issue 
 pocket of deprivation in many rural community like my south west norfolk constituency be often mask by more affluent surrounding will the minister reassure i that financial support from the government for local council in rural area reflect those concern about isolated deprivation 
 this month we be consult on an update assessment of need that we will implement from importantly that include the index of multiple deprivation a designate national statistic and it will drill down to deprivation level of between and household in each of those unit our intention be to address the issue find in the pocket of deprivation in every community include rural and coastal community where they be sometimes drown out because of the sea of affluence around they it be important that we get to deprivation wherever it exist 
 as an outer london borough havering have be hugely disadvantage by a funding formula base on outdated population figure we hear today that the mayor of london himself be concern that this labour government will level down london altogether will the minister confirm that the fair funding review will report by this summer i have be tell that previously by a minister and will specifically address the disparity between inner and outer london 
 i can absolutely assure the hon member that we be work through those issue and we will consult the sector on they give all the variation that we will take into account i hope member accept that we have listen we know that the funding formula be out of date and that for it to stand the test it must apply wherever member represent whether in coastal community rural community inner or outer london or anywhere else in between i assure the hon member that we be get on with that work 
 shropshire council ’s finance have be leave on the brink by year of conservative administration it be the large landlocked county in england and it be struggle with about of its budget be spend on social care when the minister do his fair funding review will he look at the difficulty and costliness of deliver service over such a wide rural area and ensure that council such as shropshire which have lose its rural service delivery grant will be able to sustain themselves in the future 
 we make available an additional £ as part of the settlement and £ of that be for social care we understand the pressure and we be direct money to address they but we know that this issue will take more than year to fix we be on with the fair funding review the multi year settlement in a decade to begin to fix the foundation we have definitely hear call from rural community and council to take into account the additional cost for rurality and remoteness and i assure the hon lady that those issue be be look at 
 way of ensure that new unitary authority such as those for leicestershire have adequate funding be to base that funding on robust business case give that the department be week late in provide feedback to the local authority will the minister commit to extend the deadline to ensure that those local authority have the time that they need to build up those plan 
 in all area there be more than adequate time to prepare final proposal council in the devolution priority programme have until september and all other the majority have until november that be more than adequate time for council to be able to marshal and get their plan together and make an assessment on that basis 
 it have be report that the birmingham bin strike may last until december how can this government claim to support worker when they refuse to fund birmingham city council properly this dispute boil down to cash yet the government be fail birmingham ’s bin worker   resident and business the government back our steelworker will they back the bin worker with extra funding 
 i hear what the hon gentleman say on the call that we have with mps when we update they on these issue his tone be quite different we need to separate the rhetoric from the reality the reality be that for the time we have £ in the recovery grant which be about those council suffer high deprivation and historically low tax basis birmingham be the big beneficiary of that receive nearly £ 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister know from his time at the local government association of the impact that asylum have on the budget of local authority with the home office ’s much vaunted increase in the grant rate for asylum claim the government be push thousand of household on to council waiting list and shunt million in cost on to council tax payer what additional funding and measure do he aim to secure to help to mitigate those cost which be affect so many of our local authority 
 quite frankly it be a bit rich for any shadow minister to critique the current system when the conservatives deliberately design it in their year in government the question be how we go about repair it thing must absolutely be put right the disjointed system in which different government departments work in silos can not carry on of the success of the leader council be that for the time ever local government leader be around the table with the government include in a meeting with the home office and our department to work through exactly those issue that be the change for the time those in local government be be treat as adult

 many of my constituent be concerned that too often new estate go up without the necessary infrastructure whether that be school gp surgery or   even playground do the secretary of state agree that it be vital to address that issue and can she elaborate on how we will do so after too many year of inaction 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend the government be commit to strengthen the system of developer contribution to ensure that new development provide the necessary infrastructure that community expect we will set out further detail in due course early i mention the change to the national planning policy framework that be announce in december and we will also support the increase provision and modernisation of various type of public infrastructure 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as the secretary of state have say saturday mark the anniversary of the grenfell tragedy as she know i can confirm to she that i will work constructively with she and her colleague to deliver remediation build safety and the good outcome for local community the previous government commit over £ for remediation will the secretary of state confirm that the spending review will continue to provide such financial support will she also confirm that she will meet the previous government ’s pledge to co fund with the royal borough of kensington and chelsea the renovation of the lancaster west estate and that the £ from central government need and promise to finish the work will be provide 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for the constructive way in which he have approach this issue we all remember what happen at grenfell and the work that the previous government do and we be continue that work as outline in phase of the recommendation the building minister my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris   have be meet as i have member of the community rbkc and other to make sure we continue on that journey i hesitate to say though that the previous government make a lot of promise that be challenge we will always put safety and we be work to ensure that we deliver on that 
 i know that the secretary of state have have some difficult negotiation this weekend with her colleague the chancellor the spending review be critical for the funding of the affordable home budget in the past the secretary of state have praise the chancellor ’s generosity as she put it not least for provide the extra £ for the affordable home budget but will she admit today that that budget be decrease from previous level under our government will she say even if it be after the spending review exactly how many affordable and social home she expect to deliver during this parliament 
 the shadow secretary of state have be call a bit later than   the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes for whom i outline the reason we have not put an exact figure on that and confirm that we will build the big increase in affordable and social housing in a generation i say gently to the shadow secretary of state that we be deliver for work people by ban no fault eviction and   introduce groundbreake protection for renter which the conservatives promise but do not deliver we be introduce major planning reform to build home they promise home but could not get anywhere we be also deliver the large ever single package of devolution measure push power out of westminster we be deliver where the conservatives fail 
 we be very good at grow thing in south norfolk include food business and thrive community however if we want our young people to share in that success we need to plant a new town in my constituency will the minister meet i to discuss how we will achieve that 
 i do not blame my hon friend for try but for good reason we establish an independent expert advisory panel the new town taskforce to make recommendation to ministers on the location and delivery of new town the taskforce will submit its final report to ministers in the come month 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 resident in wellington in castlemoat place in taunton and in agar grove homebuyer be just some of a sample who have come to i raise the scandal of house builder not properly finish the building they have create leave they unsafe what step will the minister take to bring forward measure to ensure that house builder repair and make safe their property urgently without people have to wait year 
 i be grateful for that question which raise something mirror in many part of this country the duty to make sure that home be safe be the responsibility of builder and owner where they fall short there be legal power for the local authority and for the fire and rescue service to compel they to change as with all hon and right hon colleague across the house i would be happy to help if i can with any specific example that the hon gentleman have 
 there be no doubt about it we face a climate emergency what plan do the government have to increase funding for the fire service to meet the increase and project increase in wildfire and flooding incident if funding be to be increase what will that mean for the scottish fire and rescue service 
 as my hon friend rightly identify fire be a devolved matter in england stand alone fire and rescue authority will see an increase in core spending power of nearly £ in those fire and rescue authority be require to plan for foreseeable risk in their area include wildfire and flooding and to decide where to direct resource on co operation i assure he as i do   the hon member for strangford jim shannon that i be talk to my counterpart in the devolved government to make sure that we be tackle common problem and share that insight 
 in the light of some worrying small site application on previously undeveloped green belt land in my constituency and of concern from the campaign to protect rural england will the minister undertake to monitor and assess the initial impact of the new grey belt provision and look at refine the wording to avoid salami slicing of the green belt 
 no we be confident that the protection in place for the green belt the test that have to be meet for grey belt release be robust it be ultimately for local planning authority to conduct green belt review and to bring forward those site as part of local plan 
 across london child be live in temporary accommodation deny the essential of a stable home which have terrible consequence for their physical and mental health and education this be a scandalous inheritance from the previous conservative government when do the secretary of state believe that we will begin to see those number drop substantially 
 we have invest almost £ in tackle homelessness and rough sleeping and we have recognise the scandal of temporary accommodation which we inherit we be take action to ensure that there be a cross government strategy to get we back on track to end homelessness 
 oxton in my constituency have a newly refurbish community shop and it exist thank to the hard work of local volunteer the plunkett impact report highlight how community own shop be at the centre of the local economy what be the government do to support the ownership of community shop 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the opportunity to talk about community ownership of those locally love asset we know such place endure during difficult time they provide good employment for local people and they normally employ a more diverse workforce base we be pleased in the previous round to get money out to a number of scheme through the community ownership fund we will legislate for an improved community right to buy too we be very much align in this space on the exceptional importance of community ownership 
 i thank the minister for his previous response and i be glad to see that cornwall ’s socioeconomic challenge be reflect in the fact that mission priority neighbourhood have be identify in mid cornwall alone we have talk about funding for mission critical neighbourhood but what step be be take to ensure that those mission priority neighbourhood deprive area that fall just short of that mission critical definition get adequate investment too 
 in addition to my previous answer my hon friend will have hear i talk about the importance of target resource at deprivation and need i think that be the right approach to funding it also go a bit beyond funding to power which all community can benefit from whether it be high street rental auction an enhanced community right to buy local planning process or local community take those opportunity to shape place local authority be important in that conversation i know my hon friend be push his in that regard 
 it have be estimate and report that billion worth of unspent community infrastructure levy may be available at local authority level for investment in critical infrastructure will the minister ensure that the money be invest in road and drainage so it can deliver the improvement that our resident deserve 
 there be legitimate reason why developer contribution can be hold by local authority for example so that they can complete phase development or bring forward other site over a period of time but we be aware that certain local authority hold in some case significant sum and we be give the matter some attention 
 the shared health foundation recently publish a vital report on child live in temporary accommodation which reveal the scandalous fact that all too often child live in such accommodation be not safe secure or able to thrive do the minister agree that it fall to this labour government to fix that wrong on which there have be silence for too long 
 my hon friend be right we have inherit record level of homelessness and rough sleeping but this government be determined to take action and address those challenge through the round of the local authority housing fund we be provide council with half a pound to house some of the most vulnerable people in the country and have announce an injection of £ to deliver up to new affordable social home 
 i be confident that the secretary of state love the pub as much as you and i do mr speaker but the job tax and the slashing of business rate relief have deliver a hammer blow to pub such as the barrel in walkington own by thwaites and to hospitality business such as the beverley arms hotel have the secretary of state make representation to the chancellor ahead of wednesday to ensure that more landlord be not force to call last order 
 i might like a pint and would not he like to know 
 people have live in earsdon view in my constituency for more than year but the estate remain unadopted due to an ongoing issue between the landowner northumberland estates and the developer bellway involve the securing of sewer adoption i continue   to press all party to resolve the problem but how can we ensure that people be not leave in this situation for decade often pay management fee on top of council tax and that developer deliver 
 my hon friend have be a doughty champion of leaseholder and residential freeholder in her constituency we must start to provide the consumer protection that be already on the statute book but as i have make clear we be determined to end the injustice of fleecehold entirely and will consult later this year on legislative and policy option to reduce the prevalence of private estate management arrangement 
 i broadly support unitarisation on a strategic scale but i be concerned about how historic debt will be treat in surrey especially those of woking and spelthorne council how will those debt be handle as our council come together and will the minister assure my constituent in virginia water and englefield green in the well run borough of runnymede that they will not foot the bill for this as part of the reorganisation 
 that be of the reason why the surrey arrangement be accelerate we recognise the lack of balance between the debt liability and the asset and income we also recognise that the unitarie would have to be financially viable and we be well on track to deliver that in partnership with the local council 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i welcome the enhanced protection for tenant in the renters rights bill but datum from the londoner show that for london tenant there be only enforcement officer per private rent home give the new enforcement burden that the bill place on council will the minister please ensure that they have the resource to protect private tenant 
 my hon friend will know that in the bill we have take a polluter pay approach local authority will be able to levy fine on landlord to raise revenue but my hon friend can check the transcript on this point we do commit ourselves to new burden funding as appropriate 
 give the environmental importance and scarcity of chalk stream may i urge the deputy prime minister and her team to support amendment to this afternoon ’s legislation that would protect those stream they be vital and they need as much protection as we can give they 
 as the hon gentleman will know chalk stream already have protection in national planning policy but i be sure that we will continue this discussion on report of the planning and infrastructure bill later today 
 will the minister meet i and resident of beech and willow rise in kirby where a combination of fail leasehold law previous corporate entity and inadequate regulation risk leave resident face unaffordable cost and eviction 
 i be always happy to meet my hon friend i know she have have constructive conversation with the minister with responsibility for building safety my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris but i be happy to meet she 
 social home be at risk in my chichester constituency despite have outline planning permission because developer be reject offer from register provider   will the minister commit to action to stop developer evade their obligation and will he meet i to help i protect the delivery of these social home 
 we recognise the challenge around uncontracted section unit a complex array of factor have lead we to this point but we be give serious consideration to how we unblock the problem and how we get those section home allocate and people live in they 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government what assessment she have make of the united states government ’s national security concern regard the propose chinese embassy development at royal mint court 
 this government be commit to the probity of the planning process at all level to ensure robust and evidence base decision making the process include a role for plan ministers in decide on call in planning application and recovered appeal so i hope that the house will appreciate why i can not comment in any detail on specific planning application at the dispatch box that say it may be helpful to member if i set out the process that these case follow 
 the application refer to by the right hon member be consider to meet the publish call in policy set out in the october write ministerial statement so it will be determine by minister the application be not yet with the department all decision that come before minister be subject to examination by an independent planning inspector usually through a public inquiry the planning inspector then provide an evidence base recommendation and set out their full reason for that recommendation the inspector ’s report consider the application against publish local regional and national planning policy which be likely to contain a wide variety of material planning consideration in this case those be likely to include safety and national security 
 a public inquiry be hold on this case between and   february at which interested party be able to put forward evidence and make representation should any further representation be make that raise material planning consideration before the decision be make they will also be take into account at all time the decision will be deal with in line with the publish propriety guidance on planning casework decision the right hon member will be aware that the home secretary and foreign secretary make a joint representation to the planning inspectorate ahead of the start of the inquiry that will be take into account alongside all other relevant matter once the planning inspector ’s report and recommendation be receive the case will be determine by a planning minister who will come to a decision base on material planning consideration 
 the us government and today the dutch parliament have express concern about sensitive cable under royal mint court beijing have a recent history of cut cable and confirm infrastructure hack include embed malware capable of disable all that infrastructure surprisingly the secretary of state for science innovation and technology say on television yesterday that this issue be in the planning process and could be manage will the minister correct the record the planning inquiry have conclude and no change at all can be make to the chinese planning application 
 i remind the minister that the application contain nothing about cable indeed the chinese have reject only request by the inquiry request to which he refer they be make by the government in the letter from the foreign and home secretary that be despite ministers regularly say that the letter should give those concern comfort reroute the cable would we know cost million if the government be even think about that so i ask the minister why do the government strongly deny rather than tell this house about the presence of the cable until the white house actually confirm it 
 chinese state medium have report that the uk have give assurance to the chinese that the uk would allow the development no matter what indeed the guardian newspaper report in that the chinese would not apply again unless they be give governmental assurance can the minister confirm or even deny any of this speak as of those in the chamber who have be sanction by china i see this as project kowtow there have be denial after another and betrayal after another no wonder our ally believe that this chinese mega embassy be become a walk of shame for the government 
 i thank the right hon member for those question i hope he will appreciate not least because of the quasi judicial nature of the role of plan ministers in the planning process that i can not comment on the detail of the application as i have say no decision on the case have be make and the case be not yet before the department 
 the right hon member mention cable but it would not be appropriate to comment on any specific national security issue on whether the chinese embassy issue be raise during uk us trade talk again it would not be appropriate to comment on the detail of those talk suffice it to say that we do not recognise the characterisation set out in the sunday times article in which that be reference it be important to emphasise that only material planning consideration can be take into account in determine this case as i say i can not comment in any detail on such a case and this case be not yet before the department 
 i understand that the minister can not comment on this case or any individual case but national security be of the utmost concern to everybody in this country and in this chamber when an application come before the secretary of state and in grant application from foreign government will national security be a material concern for the government 
 i thank my hon friend for his question as i make clear in respond to the initial question the inspector ’s report consider the application against publish local regional and national planning policy which be likely to include consideration of a wide variety of material planning matter in this case that be likely to include safety and national security 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   for secure this very important urgent question question after question and letter after letter the government have consistently treat parliament with complete disregard on this matter they have stonewall legitimate inquiry about national security ministerial discussion and warning from security body i get that the minister be compromise in that he have a quasi judicial responsibility here but his colleague in the home office and the foreign office do not and they could answer these question 
 as the government know their own cyber security expert innovate uk have warn about the threat to the city of london from the embassy the wappe telephone and internet exchange be surround on side by the new embassy and there be fibre cable carry highly sensitive information run beneath the site the secretary of state for science innovation and technology say yesterday that these matter could be deal with in the planning process but the inquiry have end so they can not if the government be consider move the cable how many million of pound of public money will that cost i recently send yet another cross party letter to the prime minister sign by parliamentarian urge he to pause and reconsider since then the us and dutch government have both sound the alarm 
 have mi5 and gchq be able to submit their own warning to the planning inspector do the inspector have access to unredacted plan of the embassy which the chinese government have refuse to make public have the government assess the potential sinister us of the secret basement in the so call cultural exchange building what discussion have take place with the bank of england give its role in cyber security regulation in the city why will the government not follow the example of the us australian and irish governments who veto similar embassy that threaten their national security the government be on the verge of make a decision that will lead to a huge risk that will persist for decade will they change course before it be too late 
 i appreciate that the shadow secretary of state ’s remark be write before he listen to my response but i could not have be clear about the fact that no decision have be make on this case and no application be yet before the department—[interruption it be a question he be pre empte a decision that have not be make on a case that be not before the department i have be very clear that should any further representation be make that raise material planning consideration they may in this case relate to safety and national security before a decision be make these will be take into account but again as i say to   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on matter of security it would not be appropriate for i to comment on specific issue such as cable it would not be appropriate for i to comment planning ministers have a quasi judicial role in the planning process and as i have say the case be not yet before the department 
 i be sure that the minister can understand the sensitivity of how we all feel about this china have a track   record of aggressive state back espionage surely this country can not afford to make a massive underestimation of the risk should this go ahead as expect expert warn that there could be the foreign leverage of signal interception and monitoring of sensitive government and corporate communication to what extent can individual make representation because everyone be extremely concerned that such a massive and historic building be sell some year ago this be pre empte this be how china work it plan year ahead we can not not say anything in this house we must comment on what we see please understand that we must 
 i do understand the strength of feeling convey by my hon friend and other hon member when it come to the people ’s republic of china the government be take a consistent long term and strategic approach to manage the uk ’s relation with china root in the national interest we will always protect our national security and keep the country safe but those be separate issue from this specific planning application i understand why she do so but she tempt i to speculate again as i have say on a decision that have not be make on a case that be not yet before the department 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   for submit this urgent question 
 the potential approval of the chinese super embassy send precisely the wrong signal at a moment when we should be push the chinese government hard on human right abuse and their repression of the people of hong kong both in that city and right here on our street notwithstanding the risk of interception of sensitive comms at the site hongkongers and uyghurs be deeply worried about what it might mean for china ’s expand surveillance capacity here in the uk in march alongside other opposition members i speak at the protest in front of the propose site i say the same thing to the minister as i say that day the government must block it take into account the scale of opposition both domestically and by our ally will the minister confirm that representation make in this place will be consider as part of the planning approval process if i may i will also ask consider that the original timetable for the china audit to be publish have now pass will the minister tell the house when they expect finally to present it 
 on the audit the hon gentleman ’s final point the relevant minister the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west have confirm that that will be come before the summer he raise very distinct issue and i must treat they separately on human right we stand firm include against china ’s repression of the people of xinjiang and tibet human right issue be raise every time fcdo minister meet their chinese counterpart on the application specifically he ask i a very direct question should any further representation be make by member or other interested party that raise material planning   consideration that need to be take into account in a decision they will be take into account and they will be consider before a decision be make 
 early this year i speak at a huge demonstration outside the propose embassy site which be attend by thousand of british hongkongers who fear that the hand that throttle their freedom in hong kong be reach into our society too i understand the minister ’s point and the limitation on what he can say on the issue at this time but this be not just a matter of national security do he understand that it be also a matter of personal security for many of our constituent give the increase in transnational repression emanating from beijing 
 my hon friend have be a vocal advocate for the hong kong community in his constituency and across the country we will stand with and support member of that community we have a long share history with hong kong and many people from hong kong have make the uk their home in recent year again i must emphasise this point and i will continue to do so as question on this come in that be a distinct and separate issue from the planning application that will in due course come before ministers in my department 
 it be a pleasure to speak after   the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall   today i speak before he at the rally to which he refer those of we who have be sanction i know that you madam deputy speaker be among our number be particularly conscious of the effect that the chinese state have on our country do you madam deputy speaker honestly believe that the minister think that the chinese would look at this proposal in the same way do we in this house honestly believe that something threaten our economic security as highlight by the americans and the dutch should go through a bureaucratic planning process with no ability to vary it because frankly they ’s the order i do not think that be the way china would do it and it be certainly not the way we should do it 
 it be a very clever question but it be the minister who be respond 
 the right hon gentleman ’s view on china be well know and he know my view on china too we have discuss the matter in the past he raise distinct issue on sanctioned parliamentarian let i take this opportunity to make it clear that the sanction be completely unwarranted and unacceptable and this issue will remain a priority under this government the foreign secretary and the chancellor have raise their case at every meeting with their counterpart include with president xi at the g20 in november and foreign minister wang yi in february the right hon gentleman tempt i to comment on the chinese planning system i be very glad that we have a different and more robust system than the people ’s republic of china 
 i appreciate that the minister can not comment on individual planning application from the dispatch box   but when i speak to hongkongers in my constituency they be seriously concerned about the risk that come with transnational repression and that might come along with the creation and construction of this embassy when i be speak with hongkongers in my constituency last week on the anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre something that can be commemorate in leeds but not in hong kong they be seriously concerned that those with £ bounty on their head might be more at risk now because of the construction of this embassy i appreciate that the minister ’s portfolio do not necessarily cover this but what assurance can he give on behalf of the government that if such an embassy be build we will do everything in our power to protect those from hong kong who have make the uk their home 
 i hope hon member will appreciate why i will not comment on hypothetical again on a decision that have not be make on a case that be not before the department i have make it very clear that we stand with the hong kong community the minister with responsibility for asia and the indo pacific my hon friend   the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west meet member of the hong kong community in this country along with my hon friend the security minister we will stand by they 
 the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer and the foreign secretary have all have recent high level interaction with ministers of the chinese communist party the chinese government have the chinese embassy be bring up in any of the meeting with those ministers and have those ministers in any way correspond with the minister ’s department on the chinese embassy application 
 it would not be appropriate for i to comment on the detail of any talk 
 i be not ask for detail 
 the right hon gentleman be ask for detail and it would not be appropriate for i to comment on the particular issue of whether representation have be make as i make clear in answer the initial question the home and foreign secretaries make a joint representation to the planning inspectorate ahead of the start of the inquiry and that will be take into account alongside all other relevant matter 
 from a response to a freedom of information request which i have with i we now know that just protest at the royal mint court site in february and march this year require the deployment of nearly officer in total include in february and in march the foi request reveal that the cost of police these protest alone amount to £ this be a staggering use of resource for a site that be not yet operational and it reflect the serious concern among the hongkonger tibetan and uyghur diaspora in the uk these be community that fear that the embassy will become a hub for transnational repression what assessment have ministers make of the cost implication of this propose development on policing and will they commit today to reject this super embassy 
 i be not go to commit to reject an application that have not yet come to the department and as i keep say where a decision have not be make i have make it clear that we understand the concern of member of the hong kong community and other about the potential i make clear that it be a potential approval of this application when it come to police resourcing all i can repeat be that only material planning consideration can be take into account in determine the case 
 i think we can all agree that we would like a decision to be make in this case that do not encourage the chinese government to think that we be a soft touch let we try another tack national security be go to be take into account as part of this planning decision i ask the minister this hypothetical question if there be only a chance that the granting of this planning application cause some detriment to our national security would it not be well to take a risk management approach and put the embassy somewhere else 
 the hon gentleman invite i again to consider a planning decision that have not be make on a case that be not yet before the department i be clearly not go to set out from this dispatch box the decision make process that plan ministers in my department might take to the application once it be submit 
 give the serious concern about national security can the minister confirm that his department have consult on this issue with uk and ally intelligent agency include those of the usa can he say whether a full national security review will be conduct before any planning decision be take 
 as i have make clear it would not be appropriate for i to comment on any specific national security issue what i have be at pain to make clear be that the inspector ’s report which will come before ministers in my department at the point when the case come to we will include a wide variety of material planning matter and in this case they be likely to include safety and national security matter 
 far to the question from   the hon member for rushcliffe james naish the home affairs committee have write to the metropolitan police ask for detail of any concern it may have about the policing of this site and any particular disorder that might occur around it i once again put it to the minister that he must take account of these concern there could be very serious and significant concern for police in the capital 
 all material planning consideration that have be bring to the attention of the inspector will be take into account as part of the decision when it be make in due course 
 national security and security be a valid planning consideration so do the minister accept that in the event that the secretary of state allow this decision to go ahead   regardless of the planning inspector ’s recommendation this government will essentially be put our relationship with china ahead of our security relationship with the united states 
 that be pure speculation as i have say it would not be appropriate for i to comment on any national security matter 
 do the minister believe that china will always try to exploit and infiltrate datum communication in this country 
 widespread cyber activity or interference in our democracy will not be tolerate and will be meet with a strong response 
 move on from national security accord to the documentation i have double check community safety be a significant material planning consideration in such a multicultural area what assessment of risk to community cohesion and the safety of local people be be make how do take such decision more centrally align with the government ’s much publicise commitment to devolution 
 i do not know whether hon member can hear i i keep answer the question as pose and i have answer that question if the issue that the hon lady raise be a material planning consideration the inspector will take it into account in their recommendation to ministers to make a decision once the case come to the department 
 china be already revel in the government ’s spectacular own goal in handing over chagos china look as if it be about to benefit again even if the minister can not say what amount be involve will he say what work would need to be do in advance of the embassy be set up at the royal mail site and who would pay for that would it be the chinese or would it be the uk government and which part 
 as i say a public inquiry be hold between and   february and all the relevant document submit to that inquiry be available online i encourage the right hon gentleman to go and look at they again he invite i to speculate on matter that be part of the application that the inspector will have consider in make his report and recommendation when that arrive to the department i emphasise again that no case be yet with the department 
 if national security be a material consideration will that be judge only by what be in the inspector ’s report if so how could that be adequate since the uk ’s china audit will not have be publish before the inspector conclude his report 
 at the point when the planning inspector ’s report and recommendation be receive it will be determine by a planning minister who will come to a decision base on material planning consideration that have be analyse 
 i understand that the minister can not comment on the specific but do he at least agree with the principle that if there be a risk that a nation state will act nefariously against the british state ’s interest the british government should not reward that state 
 as i have be at pain to make clear the government will always protect our national security and keep this country safe there be a distinct issue from the planning application and the question about process that have be put to i on that basis i can not comment as the hon gentleman have acknowledge on a decision that have not be make and on a case that be not with the department 
 my constituency be home to a grow number of people from hong kong who have be force to flee their homeland as a result of action by china i appreciate what the minister say about this be a quasi legal matter and the fact that a foreign office minister be sit next to he speak volume about how this be not just a planning issue do he agree that this country owe a debt to hongkongers whom we need to protect from the chinese interference that they consider this super embassy would enable 
 i do recognise that point as i have make clear the government will stand with and support member of the hong kong community as i say i do not know whether the hon gentleman be in the chamber for this the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west and the minister for security meet member of the hong kong community only recently we will continue to stand with they 
 the minister have make it clear that he will not comment on the specific of the case and i will not ask he to but can he offer a view in principle on why we would ever offer a foreign state with know cyber espionage capability that it deploy regularly easy access to critical cyber infrastructure 
 again the hon gentleman be make assumption that i do not recognise and thereby tempt i to comment on the case i be not go to make blanket in principle statement give the quasi judicial nature and involvement of plan ministers in the process 
 lee anderson be you bob or not bob 
 indicate dissent 
 marvellous i call jim shannon 
 thank you very much madam deputy speaker i be somewhat throw off there 
 i thank the minister for his answer he will be aware of concern that chinese bear resident in my constituency and across northern ireland have about the reach and indeed the overreach of the chinese government in the   united kingdom i can well understand us concern and with all due respect he know i always ask my question with respect do the minister truly believe that this massive embassy will alleviate the concern of those who know good the reach of the chinese government ’s arm should we not be show that while we will accord they courtesy as we do with other national embassy they be not entitle to a chinese vatican city in the midst of this great nation of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 i do recognise the concern the hon gentleman raise but forgive i madam deputy speaker i have to repeat again that no decision have be make in this case no case be yet with the department i have lay out in quite some detail the process that have be follow in how the application have be take forward and what need to happen for ministers to reach a decision at the appropriate point when a case come to the department
