 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to promote biodiversity recovery 
 this government be determined to halt and reverse the trend of nature loss in our country and end the cycle of destroy regret and restore we be invest £ in tree planting and peatland restoration we have announce a new nature restoration fund and set out plan to end the use of neonicotinoid pesticide that harm our precious pollinator 
 i be grateful to the minister for her reply the uk be of the most nature deplete nation on this planet the state of nature report indicate that up to in uk specie face the risk of extinction the minister ’s reply be very encouraging but just last week the chancellor promote the government ’s growth agenda urge we to 
 stop worry about bat and newts 
 if it really do come to that who speak for the government and whose side be the minister on the chancellor or threaten wildlife 
 we have to end the false dichotomy between create place for people and create place for nature the previous government introduce biodiversity net gain which mean that when a developer build somewhere they must deliver a bng for nature that be in its early stage after just a year but we be look to see how it might be extend with the nature restoration fund we have establish a more efficient and effective way to allow obligation relate to our most important site and specie to be discharge at scale which have the great environmental benefit and be a win win for nature and people 
 i congratulate the minister on announce our plan to ban bee kill pesticide that be welcome across monmouthshire   particularly by our fantastic charity base in monmouth bees for development do she agree that where the conservatives fail this government will restore nature and biodiversity for future generation 
 i do agree and i pay tribute to the people who be speak for the bee in my hon friend ’s constituency we will deliver by on land in england that mean that we will protect and preserve of our land for nature and long term conservation and management as part of our contribution to international target 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when we think it could not get any bad the government roll out their late attack on our farming community and uk food production set the direction that they want to replace food production with around of farmland be dedicate to solar farm tree planting biodiversity offset and wildlife habitat all to meet green target the figure be astonishing with the government propose to take well over hectare out of food production 
 the economic analysis already predict that well over farm will be lose within a generation as a result of this government ’s policy will the minister acknowledge that hard work farmer be be catch in the crossfire in this government ’s dash towards green target and do she recognise the fear among our farmer that their policy amount not to food security but food lunacy 
 that be a lot of sound and fury but this be something the conservatives be work on in government this have shade of the deposit return scheme which be essentially the hon gentleman ’s legislation but those on the shadow front bench be absent without leave when it come to the vote we have publish a consultation on the land use framework it have be welcome by the national farmers union and by farmer for give certainty and security something that be sadly lack from the previous government 
 what step he be take to increase the accountability of water company executive for service failure 
 i thank my hon friend for his service on the water special measures bill committee he will know that the bill create new power for the regulator include ban the payment of unjustified bonus for water boss whose company fail to meet environmental standard and ensure that imprisonment be a sentencing option where environmental regulator be obstruct that will hold water company and their executive to account in addition we be double compensation for poor service to hold water company to account for failure in their service delivery 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer many of my constituent in southampton itchen have write to i outrage at the bill increase that southern water be propose at a time when it and   other continue to pollute our river at an alarming rate this be simply become a national scandal as part of the work of the come independent water review will the secretary of state ensure that water company get back to deliver reliable service for customer rather than line the pocket of executive and shareholder 
 my hon friend make an important point bill of course be go up because the previous government do nothing as our sewerage infrastructure crumble and million of pound be allow to be divert to pay for bonus and dividend instead of investment this government have ringfence the money earmark for infrastructure so that this scandal can never happen again 
 essex and suffolk water have issue a moratorium on commercial business pull water out of the ground which it say be due to the environment agency the problem be that water intensive business need water to grow aspall in my constituency have £ of investment ready to go to grow its cidery without access to water it can not make that investment if this government be serious about go for growth will the minister meet i to find a solution to the moratorium so that we can move forward 
 i be more than happy to ask the minister for water my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy to meet the hon gentleman who raise an important point i have ask sir jon cunliffe to look at how we can well manage this as part of the work he be lead 
 what step he be take to help reduce sewage in river 
 what step he be take to help improve the health of river 
 the previous government do nothing as water company discharge record level of sewage into our waterway the water special measures bill will create new power include ban water company that pollute from pay bonus and bring criminal charge against persistent lawbreaker ofwat have confirm a record £ investment to fix our break water infrastructure and end the tory sewage scandal once and for all 
 in harrogate and knaresborough the river nidd regularly overflow with sewage when i visit the killinghall sewage treatment work last year a key thing that come to light be that water company be put in infrastructure to manage the current sewage issue rather than future proofing what step will the minister take to ensure we build sewage work that meet both current and future demand 
 the money announce in ofwat ’s final determination before christmas will create record level of investment in our water system to do precisely what   the hon gentleman say deal with the current sewage problem while also put in place the infrastructure to manage and meet future demand 
 as the secretary of state know north herefordshire be badly affect by water pollution with devastating effect for the local economy he also know that agricultural pollution not sewage be the main problem in my constituency he do not mention that in his answer so i respectfully remind he yet again that the government need to tackle agricultural pollution and sewage pollution in a join up way we know the solution 
 order 
 i apologise mr speaker i will get to my point as the minister do not answer the part of the question i have to raise it in north herefordshire we know that the solution require farmer regulator and environmental organisation to take action together will the secretary of state now commit the funding need to take forward the wye catchment plan and will he visit north herefordshire with i 
 order i think the minister have hear the question 
 the hon lady make an important point our farming road map will look at how we can reduce run off from agriculture which be a major source of pollution in our waterway we be look at how we can move to catchment base model include for the wye where a great deal of important work have already be do so that we can more effectively tackle all the source of pollution that be cause such trouble for our waterway 
 what step his department be take to support flood preparedness project 
 what step he be take to support flood preparedness project 
 the duty of any government be to protect our citizen so we be invest a record £ over year in building maintain and upgrade flood defence which will protect property across england 
 across my constituency of guildford the local flood forum work tirelessly bring together agency and resident to address the grow concern they have about flooding will the minister provide detail on how the government will ensure that constituency like mine which often miss out because they be semi rural and urban get the funding they need to address current flooding issue how can we mitigate the grow flooding issue across guildford in a holistic and sustainable way

 i think i will be get a lot of question like this today mr speaker we will announce where the project will be by the end of march we will also be look at where we have have to put money into maintenance and upgrading defence we be leave with flood defence in their bad state on record because of a complete dereliction of duty by the previous government so we have have to prioritise maintenance as well as build new defence but i be hop that the hon gentleman will not have to wait too long 
 i call the chair of the environmental audit committee 
 my hon friend the minister and my right hon friend the secretary of state deserve great credit for attract the large investment that they have secure but once they have finish the lap of honour they will be aware that this be the step up the mountain the minister be right that the government have inherit flood defence that be in an appalling state and the late estimate show that as many as house be at risk of flooding i call on she to get on with the flood improvement that we demand in chesterfield will she tell we more about how she will ensure the money will be spend wisely secondly how will she ensure that the treasury understand that this be not a year commitment but something that we will need for the rest of this term in office 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and may i congratulate he on his recent engagement he be right to point out the importance of money be spend wisely now to save money in the future there be a couple of interesting factor every £ we spend on maintenance of flood defence save £ in damage prevention and every £ we spend on new defence save £ in damage prevention those be important statistic that i use frequently in negotiation about future spending review with treasury official 
 in the north of my constituency between the scottish border and hadrian ’s wall lie the debatable land but in the centre of carlisle lie a forget land along the river caldew it be forget because of the incompetence of the conservatives who fail to deliver the flood defence along the caldew that be promise after carlisle be devastate in will the minister remember the forget land of carlisle 
 my hon friend make a persuasive case as she have do at every oral question time we have have so far she be right to highlight the fact that not only do the previous government leave our defence in the bad state on record but they fail to spend some of   the money that have be allocate this government be have to deal with that along with the many other issue we be clean up 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yet another wet winter across somerset highlight the need for the government to urgently deliver solution to mitigate the impact of flooding on farmland and protect domestic food production the brue headwater multi benefit project facilitate by the farming and wildlife advisory group south west be work with farmer and landowner in bruton charlton musgrove and wincanton to address flooding issue and to hold workshop that focus on natural flood management to slow the flow of water across the upper brue thus reduce flooding sediment run off and the associated pollution of water- course despite those effort many farmer in the catchment and indeed the county and the country be angry at the level of inundation of land that could be prevent by well flood management how will the minister work to support farmer build flood resilience and protect food security 
 the hon lady be right to point out how angry farmer be and how they feel they have be let down by the previous government on flood defence the previous formula allocate funding only base on number of property protect and pay little regard to rural area she also mention of my favourite theme natural flood management we recently hold a roundtable on that with representative from the nfu and the country land and business association to talk about how we can well protect our rural area in a more nature friendly way

 as a proud cat dad to cat of which be beat to the title of purr minister by attlee mr speaker ’s cat it have amaze i to find out that the regulation on animal breeding focus merely on dog and not cat breeding can the minister therefore assure i that he will look at update the regulation to include cat 
 i thank the hon member for his question and for his reference the animal welfare committee have provide its opinion on the welfare implication of current and emergent feline breeding practice and we will be look at those and come back with measure in future in pass may i pay tribute to organisation such as cats protection which do such wonderful work i be tell that it recently   point the minister my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy to her new kitten lily and meglatron 
 there be cat owner in the uk and hundred of thousand of cat be kill on the road every year the previous government agree that it would be right to include cat in the road safety act but they simply do not do it this mean that cat be regularly hit and because there be no legal duty to report it be just scoop to the side of the road do the minister agree that this be something that we should do to bring parity to cat and dog when it come to safety on the road 
 this be an issue that have be widely discuss our advice be that it would be difficult to enforce in practice but i fully recognise the distress and concern that it cause

 the hon gentleman make an important set of point but i point he to the speech that my right hon friend the secretary of state make at oxford because he make the very strong point that farming need to get a well return for the hard work that farmer do alongside that diversification be important to allow people to get through the difficult time which inevitably come up in a cyclical business such as farming 
 the increase demand for biofuel feedstock offer a huge opportunity for agriculture particularly in feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel with the welcome saf mandate and revenue certainty mechanism there be a real chance for growth in this area especially if we support rapid conversion at grangemouth what step be the minister take to secure a scalable supply of feedstock and how he will remove barrier to their use in the production of saf

 farmer across devon be rightly concerned about labour ’s plan change to agricultural property relief and business property relief particularly the serious impact on family farm and on the sustainability of rural community in early december i write to the secretary of state to invite he to meet devon ’s farming community at an event to be organise in conjunction with the nfu in devon to provide clarity on the policy objective and to address their concern i be yet to receive a response i ask he directly now will he come to devon meet local farmer and explain how these policy will not undermine their livelihood and the future of british farming

 my hon friend be absolutely right there be a real opportunity here with £ of purchase power in the public sector so we be look at way of ensure that happen it be a real surprise for we to find that the previous government have not even measure the amount that be be buy that be the starting point we will start to make that happen and we will get that huge opportunity for british farmer 
 i welcome the government ’s focus in this area of the barrier that small agricultural business in my constituency face in supply the public sector be the complexity of the contracting process the crown commercial service make significant improvement to its portal last year but i urge the ministerial team to build on that progress to make it easy particularly for small company to provide food to the public sector ultimately we all want to see more of that 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman not only for his question but for his interest in and attendance at defra question we be honour to have he here i be very happy to look at what he suggest and to work towards make those proposal work we know that it be complicated within world trade organisation rule but there be a real prize to be have here 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the role of any government be to protect their citizen yesterday we announce that we be commit a record £ to build and maintain around flood defence to protect life home and business a uplift per annum on what the previous government be spend we be immediately use £ to unblock over project that be ready for delivery but stall under the previous government   we be launch a consultation to update the funding formula so that we can speed up new scheme and ensure that rural and coastal community be properly include the previous government leave our flood defence in the bad condition ever record this government will put they right

 the head of the dover port health authority warn the environment food and rural affairs committee this week that if funding be not secure with week food security check at the border will be stop that will mean unchecked and potentially dangerous meat appear on supermarket shelf and in restaurant at a time when there be foot and mouth disease in germany when will the secretary of state protect our border and confirm that funding 
 the national farmers union and other interested party have quite rightly raise concern about the discovery of foot and mouth disease in germany we be relieve that there have not be a further spread of that outbreak but we be take all appropriate measure at the border to ensure that this country remain safe in term of biosecurity and we will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action to ensure that there can be no repeat of what happen around year ago when a foot and mouth outbreak in this country devastate farming and cost the economy a total of £ 
 i do not think the secretary of state either understand my question or know the answer because i ask he when he will confirm the funding compare this relaxed approach with the prime minister ’s seem desperation to pay more than the entire defra budget to surrender the chagos island do the secretary of state really support tax british farming family for die slash winter fuel payment for rural pensioner and hike taxis on rural business to pay £ to a foreign government on some dodgy legal advice from labour lawyer 
 if the shadow secretary of state really care about value for money she would not have waste £ on relocate her office in the department of health a project that be purely about her own personal vanity

 i thank my hon friend who be right to highlight how the previous flooding formula discriminate against rural community because it be base purely on the number of property protect not on create the right solution in the right area that be exactly why we wish to reform the formula and we will be announce a consultation very shortly 
 give that the office for budget responsibility refuse to endorse the £ black hole figure in fact it refuse to say that there be any black hole at all will the secretary of state tell the house what possible justification there can be for the removal of agricultural property relief which will do untold damage to the growth prospect of family farm in my constituency and across the country 
 the right hon member be fully aware of the appalling state the public finance be leave in at the end of his government this government have have to take very difficult decision to balance the finance so we can get growth that will benefit the entire economy include the farming sector which be on its knee after year of conservative rule 
 the solicitor general be ask 
 what step she be take to ensure adequate number of crown prosecution service prosecutor 
 i would like to start by congratulate us attorney general pam bondi on her confirmation yesterday the attorney general and i look forward to work closely with she on our long list of share priority 
 cps prosecutor perform vital work to serve the public and deliver justice for victim we have take step to strengthen the cps workforce include by boost staff number in specialist rape and serious sexual assault unit as well as by be tough on crime support victim and restore confidence in the criminal justice system all these thing be part of this government ’s mission to make our street safe and the cps have a key role to play in that mission 
 will the solicitor general join i in welcome this government ’s increase funding of the crown prosecution service for specialist sexual offence prosecution unit do she agree that we must continue to tackle violence against woman and girl across our nation and will she join i in pay tribute to the dedication of our prosecutor and police on the front line who be confront these crime 
 absolutely i be delighted to join my hon friend in pay tribute to police and prosecutor not only in his constituency but right across the united kingdom he be right to welcome the increase funding that we have secure for the cps our recently agree settlement will ensure that the cps can recruit more specialist prosecutor deliver that vital work and put those who commit these abhorrent crime behind bar 
 give the backlog in crown court appearance and the increase tide of knife crime as well as criminal activity against woman and girl what step be the department take to ensure that the crown prosecution service be adequately provide for so that justice be see to be do in the wide community 
 the hon member make an important point this government be work very hard to do that the settlement for the cps that i refer to be an extra £ and it be spend some of that on increase the number of prosecutor who be able to do the important work to which he refer 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case involve violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case involve violence against woman and girl 
 the scale of violence against woman and girl in this country be intolerable and the government be treat it as the national emergency that it be the cps have begin secure conviction of offender who breach domestic abuse protection order a scheme that the government introduce in november in order well to protect victim of domestic abuse although there be much more to be do that be   just example of the clear action that the government be take to meet our mission to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade 
 the national conviction rate for domestic abuse case be woefully low stand at but the picture be even bad in rural constituency such as ribble valley where the overall conviction rate be only what do the solicitor general regard as the unique challenge in rural area and what step be she take to tackle they specifically 
 my hon friend raise an important issue she be right to highlight the unique risk face by woman in rural area include her constituency increase isolation can bring with it more risk to tackle violence against woman we need to address the overall number of prosecution which unfortunately be still far too low that be why work with the cps and the police we have bring in the domestic abuse joint justice plan which i be pleased to say be already lead to a modest increase in referral of domestic abuse case to improve the investigation prosecution and handling of domestic abuse case 
 in june of rape investigation be close because the victim drop out on top of that i have hear harrowing story from my constituent who go to court over their sexual assault and who feel humiliate and be far traumatise by that process what work be be do to ensure that victim of sexual violence be treat with empathy and respect during the court process 
 my hon friend ask a pertinent question and i be sure the whole house will be sorry to hear of the example that she raise she be right to say that all victim ought to be treat with empathy and respect because victim loss of confidence in the criminal justice undermine the entire process of justice i be work with the cps to ensure well support for victim in rape and serious sexual offence case include by hire victim liaison officer in team prosecute such case i have the pleasure of meet some of those victim liaison officer while visit the cps in cardiff and i be able to hear hand about the vital work they be do to support victim 
 my constituency be blight by the shocking crime of child sexual exploitation and rebuild trust among victim in our criminal justice system be vital if victim be to come forward recently man from my constituency be sentence for the horrendous gang rape of child and receive shockingly short sentence be as low as year i have write to the attorney general on this issue do the solicitor general agree that these weak sentence be hugely damaging trust in our justice system will she commit via the attorney general to review they 
 the example that the hon member refer to be indeed heinous the conduct of those who have be involve in such crime have rightly shock and appalled people right across the country he refer to a referral to the attorney general ’s office and it be therefore not appropriate for i to comment on that specific case far 
 i have have many victim of domestic abuse write to i follow lengthy period of inaction from the police the crown prosecution service and other organisation which have leave victim at risk and feel horribly anxious how will the minister ensure that prosecution rate improve and victim have confidence in the criminal justice system 
 the hon member make an important point i be sorry to hear of the example that she raise this government have a historic mission to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade and we be take a series of important step to work towards the increase number of prosecution that she refer to for example we be introduce specialist rape and sexual offence team in every police force work to increase referral with the recently launch domestic abuse joint justice plan fast track rape case and introduce free independent legal adviser for victim of adult rape i refer early to domestic abuse protection order and the conviction for breach of they be already be see 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the serious fraud office ’s progress on tackle economic crime 
 the sfo do crucial work to tackle complex fraud bribery and corruption i have meet senior sfo staff on multiple occasion in the past month and i recently visit sfo hq to understand more about the way it be put the late technology to use in tackle economic crime and return steal fund to victim under the new director of the sfo the sfo have open new overt investigation and charge defendant in case involve more than victim 
 my hon friend will know that fraud do not stop at the border and resident in my livingston constituency be incredibly concerned by the increase in fraud and economic crime and the devastating effect they can have on people ’s life what be the uk government do to tackle fraud in scotland 
 my hon friend be right that fraud do not acknowledge border particularly when it come to the increase harm associate with online fraud that be why it be so important that the sfo work closely with the scottish law enforcement authority in that respect and in other this government be fully commit to strengthen the union 
 i thank the solicitor general for that reply we in northern ireland understand that economic crime be use by paramilitary to fund their organisation and criminal group in america al capone be put in jail not for the crime he commit but for tax evasion and financial issue will the attorney general target paramilitary group for their effort to raise money illegally 
 the hon member make an important point this government take economic crime incredibly seriously include when it link to the serious type of activity to which he refer 
 what step she be take to increase transparency in the attorney general 's office 
 what step she be take to manage conflict of interest in the attorney general ’s office 
 what step she be take to manage conflict of interest in the attorney general ’s office 
 the attorney general ’s office have a rigorous process for identify and deal with conflict and potential conflict that arise from law officer former practice as part of that process the ago adopt a cautious and beyond reproach threshold to any conflict or potential conflict these arrangement be long standing and part of a standard practice that have apply across successive administration 
 former law officer have criticise the attorney general for not declare his earning label it as irregular and a break from normal practice who be in the wrong the former law officer or the attorney general 
 the hon member will know that the attorney general cease all private practice follow his appointment the hon member refer to fee agreement and he will know that there be different arrangement and requirement for declaration for member of the house of lords and for member of the house of commons it do not matter which type of fee agreement be in place between a lawyer and their client because the entirety of those agreement whether a conditional fee agreement a damage base agreement on a fully pay basis or when act pro bono will always be catch by the conflict process the requirement for the purpose of the house of lords be the same for all peer and they apply just as much to the shadow attorney general as to the attorney general 
 do the solicitor general agree with the recent policy exchange research paper conflict of interest and the law officer convention author by dr conor casey a senior lecturer at surrey law school and support by former ministers who be all kc that invoke the law officer convention on question about the potential conflict of interest relate to the work of the attorney general would be an error as such question do not fall within the scope of the convention 
 as i have say the attorney general ’s office have a rigorous process for identify and deal with conflict and potential conflict that arise from the law officer former practice the law officer convention to which the right hon member refer exist for very good reason which be to enable the government of this country to receive full and frank advice in any event the attorney general have be clear that he do not agree with that report in particular he do not agree that a law officer would   indicate whether they have recuse themselves from a particular matter because that in itself would breach the law officer convention 
 my constituent in central suffolk and north ipswich be decent tolerant and thoughtful people but they be leave wonder how the prime minister have appoint an attorney general who be a friend and a labour party donor as well as someone who have represent gerry adams shamima begum and hamas and clearly have question to answer regard outside earning do the solicitor general think that the ag be an appropriate appointment 
 again unfortunately the opposition be fall into the trap of believe that barrister be their client that be a deliberate conflation of representation and endorsement as the hon member will be fully aware barrister be not their client in the same way that surgeon be not their patient that be a foundational principle of the british legal and judicial system and opposition members ought not to undermine that 
 do the solicitor general agree that the uk legal system be the envy of the world and a key engine for growth in our economy and that the conservative party risk undermine a fundamental principle of our legal system that everyone have the right to representation and that lawyer can represent their client without fear or favour 
 i wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend the conservative party would do well to talk up our excellent british legal and judicial system rather than consistently seek to undermine the foundational principle to which he refer 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 the attorney general have admit to recuse himself from certain matter he have also maintain absolute silence about which matter those may be in these circumstance we must ask ourselves be that the level of transparency that our democracy demand what safeguard exist when the attorney general ’s past client and present duty overlap who independent of the attorney general himself scrutinise those critical decision on recusal or do we face the concern spectacle of the government ’s chief legal adviser mark his own homework 
 as i have outline the attorney general ’s office have rigorous and long stand process in place upon appointment the ago compile a list of matter in which the law officer have previously be involve by search case cross referencing with information obtain by the law officer ’s chamber or firm and work through the list with the law officer themselves the office work with the government legal department the foreign commonwealth and development office the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office to obtain additional information and compile the final list of conflict and action associate with each case as the shadow solicitor general know the attorney general can not publish a   list of his former client due to client confidentiality interruption opposition members groan but client confidentiality be a fundamental principle absolutely ridiculous 
 the shadow solicitor general mention recusal the attorney general have already indicate in the other place that he have recuse himself from matter the law officer convention prohibit i from list those matter no other law officer have ever publish a list of the case that they be recuse from 
 the solicitor general her predecessor and every conservative law officer from the previous administration rightly and properly understand their duty to declare previous earning why do the attorney general refuse to declare money receive from his practice as a barrister why do he not acknowledge whether he continue to receive such payment when his predecessor routinely declare both why do this attorney general think that there be rule for he and another rule for everyone else 
 the attorney general be in the house of lords so the rule that apply be different from those that apply in the house of commons that be the difference between the attorney general and the previous solicitor general and i those requirement be the same for all peer include the attorney general and they apply just as much to the shadow attorney general the lords commissioners for standards say that they consider the complaint make by the shadow justice secretary about the peers code of conduct and dismiss they 
 order it be past am and we need to get through some more question 
 whether she have have meeting with her counterpart in the devolved administration since take office 
 this government be commit to strengthen relation with devolved government and foster great collaboration build on mutual respect and trust as the hon member would expect the law officer very regularly meet our counterpart to discuss our share priority 
 the scottish national party ’s deposit return scheme be a complete shamble which the last conservative government stop prevent it from hurt scottish business with more regulation and high cost the snp government be now face legal action over the scheme with business seek hundred of million of pound in compensation i appreciate that the solicitor general can not comment on a live case but will she confirm that the snp government will be solely responsible for any cost that may be incur in handle the case 
 the hon member be right that i can not comment on the specific matter that he raise but i be happy to look at it and to write to he 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of the use of technology to improve efficiency in the criminal justice system 
 new technology have the potential to bring transformative benefit to the criminal justice system as it do to public service more broadly with regard to artificial intelligence both the cps and the sfo be keen to explore the efficiency opportunity that this new technology can bring while be mindful of ethical consideration 
 we have see a sickening rise in predator use ai technology to generate child sexual abuse image i be glad that the government recently announce measure to close the loophole in this area but will the solicitor general assure we that the whole criminal justice system be use every new technology and ai as well as tough sentence to crack down on it and protect child and victim of this horrific abuse 
 my hon friend be right to raise this extremely important point that be exactly why i welcome the home secretary ’s announcement that this government will be the in the world to make it illegal to possess create or distribute ai tool design to generate child sexual abuse material punishable by up to year in prison 
 what step she be take to help ensure increase prosecution rate for rural crime 
 the government be commit to keep everyone in this country safe whether they live in a town a city or a rural area that be why we be put more police officer and police community support officer on the beat and it be why we have bolster the crown prosecution service ’s workforce with specific regard to rural crime we be commit to implement the equipment theft prevention act and to the continue funding of the national rural crime unit 
 as i be sure the solicitor general know fly tipping be the most commonly report rural crime in the last year for which there be full datum there be well over significant multi load incident i use the phrase specifically as it be an internal description those incident cost more than £ to clear up yet just custodial sentence be hand out in that time what assurance can she give i and my constituent that the most egregious example of fly tipping like those we see in lichfield week ago will result in jail time for the perpetrator 
 fly tipping blight community and i be grateful to my hon friend for raise the issue i know that he have also raise it with the minister for food security and rural affairs but i be happy to arrange a meeting with his local chief crown prosecutor to discuss the matter far 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the tragic hit and run case of ryan saltern in my rural north cornwall constituency as well as many other case across the country highlight a concern problem in our legal system the driver fail to stop render aid at the scene or even call leave ryan for dead the case be hear in a magistrate court where the driver receive a month suspend sentence ryan ’s parent helen and mark and sister leanne have campaign tirelessly on the issue will the solicitor general please look into the issue in conjunction with the cps and the department for transport and meet i to discuss her finding 
 this be a profoundly tragic case and i be grateful to the hon member for raise it my heartfelt condolence go to ryan ’s family i know that they and other have be campaign for change to the law in this area and support family who have be through similarly tragic circumstance i will discuss the case that the hon member raise with my colleague in the ministry of justice and ensure that he receive a full response 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people who commit hate crime 
 whether online or in person stir up hatred or incite violence will not be tolerate the government be determined to take swift and robust action to stamp out hate crime and perpetrator will face the full force of the law 
 february mark lgbt history month and last night many people come together in speaker ’s house to hear about the progress that have be make in tackle hate crime against the lgbt community will the solicitor general outline what step have be take to ensure that trans people in particular feel safe and that perpetrator of hate crime towards tran people be bring to justice 
 the cps prosecute all case that be refer to it provide that they meet the full code test for crown prosecutor i think we would all admit that there be more to do regard the incident to which the hon member refer the cps and police national hate crime lead be commit to joint working to increase the number of police referral to the cps for hate crime offence 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the criminal legal aid advisory board have ask the government to raise fee in rape and serious sexual offence case to address the shortage of advocate prosecutor often earn to less than defence barrister in the same case do the solicitor general think that she should have a look at fee to ensure that there be not a shortage of advocate particularly in these serious case 
 my hon friend be right to identify this as a problem i know from discussion with rasso charity in my constituency that the shortage of counsel be a direct contributor to case be adjourn or delay it contribute to the unfortunate slow pace    of justice and to victim attrition minister in the ministry of justice have commit to work with the bar leadership via the criminal legal aid advisory board and to look at long term reform of legal aid 
 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary to make a statement on the situation in israel and the occupied palestinian territories 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this important matter and for the urgent question be grant the whole house will be well aware that for the people of gaza so many of whom have lose life home or loved one the last month of conflict have be a living nightmare 
 the uk be clear that we must see a negotiate state solution with a sovereign palestinian state which include the west bank and gaza alongside a safe and secure israel with jerusalem as the share capital that have be the framework for peace for decade our priority remain ensure the fragile ceasefire continue that all the hostage be release that much need aid get into gaza and that we can rebuild that pathway to sustainable peace palestinians must determine the future of gaza with support from regional state and the wide international community 
 we would oppose any effort to move palestinians in gaza to neighbour arab state against their will there must be no forced displacement of palestinians nor any reduction in the territory of the gaza strip palestinian civilian should be able to return to and rebuild their home and their life that be a right guarantee under international law gaza be home to palestinians and remain an integral part of what must become a future palestinian state with palestinians live next to israelis in peace and security the us have play a critical role in negotiate the ceasefire agreement between israel and hamas alongside qatar and egypt as hon member may know the prime minister reiterate that in his call with president trump we must now work together to ensure the ceasefire be implement in full and become permanent 
 the uk be invest in the ceasefire by do all it can to support the surge in aid that be need alongside our exist support on   january   i announce a furth £ in funding to ensure healthcare food and shelter reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure across the occupied palestinian territories and neighbouring country 
 we be also concerned at the expansion of the government of israel ’s war aim and operation in the west bank stability be essential at this crucial time we recognise israel ’s right to defend itself and the continue threat pose by armed group but it must show restraint and ensure the scale and conduct of its operation be commensurate to the threat pose civilian must be protect and the destruction of civilian infrastructure minimised the uk remain opposed to illegal settlement their expansion and settler violence 
 in conclusion our attention must now turn to how we secure a permanently well future for the israeli and palestinian people ground to reiterate the point a final time in a state solution 
 i thank my right hon friend for her statement 
 the context in which we approach this question be follow month of bloodshed and the death of almost palestinians and a welcome temporary ceasefire so the remark of the us president in conference with the israeli prime minister that the us will 
 take over the gaza strip 
 to create a 
 riviera of the middle east 
 and that 
 palestinians live in gaza 
 should live in other country be reckless and dangerous that have embolden the israeli defence minister katz overnight to far propose the displacement of palestinians from gaza the remark be generate fear and tension in the palestinian population and across the middle east as evidence by the statement of egypt jordan saudi arabia and other and will cause concern and more determined demonstration in the uk 
 the us president have also restore arm shipment end funding to the united nations relief and works agency and withdraw from the un human rights council netanyahu say that israel will redraw the map and the israeli defence forces have detonate whole street in the jenin refugee camp in the west bank in such dangerous circumstance we should be careful calculated and accurate in our use of language force displacement of the type advocate which have already occur within the gaza strip be a breach of international humanitarian right and a war crime advocate the expulsion of a people be also justly describe as ethnic cleansing and can only be achieve through yet far appalling violence i acknowledge that the government will wish to maintain their diplomatic relationship with the us as a long stand friend but it be the role of friend to be honest with each other and the uk must use its influence 
 the prime minister ’s remark yesterday that the palestinians must be allow home be most welcome but the government must go far will the minister say that the uk reject the president ’s remark and those of the israeli prime minister and defence minister will she confirm that recognition of the palestinian state be an urgent necessity in resolve the conflict will she confirm that the border of that state be the border set out in un security council resolution finally when will the uk government respond to the international court of justice advisory opinion on the israeli occupation of the occupied palestinian territories 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his many point of course he be right to underline the appalling suffering that so many gazans have experience over recent month we also recognise the suffering of the hostage and their family this have be a truly horrendous time for gazans palestinians and israelis the ceasefire must be hold to not just in phase but in phase and and ultimately we must see a state solution 
 my hon friend talk about the role of egypt jordan and saudi arabia i reassure he that the uk continue to work with all partner in the region towards peace which be so important he mention unrwa i be   sure he be aware of the uk government ’s position we believe that unrwa must continue to operate not just in gaza but on the west bank and in relation to palestinian refugee in the region more broadly he also mention the situation in jenin we have be very clear there must be de escalation we be deeply concerned about the potential for further instability because of recent development 
 in my hon friend ’s primary question around displacement he refer to the prime minister ’s statement yesterday the prime minister could not have be clear in what he say like so many of we be move by 
 the image of thousand of palestinians literally walk through the rubble to try to find their home and their community in gaza they must be allow home they must be allow to rebuild and we should be with they in that rebuild on the way to a state solution ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 the uk ’s position have be crystal clear i do not believe that there be any confusion around it and i appreciate that my hon friend be not suggest that there be 
 my hon friend ask about the uk ’s position on recognition he will be aware that we have state that position a number of time in the house include at length in the statement by the foreign secretary on the ceasefire deal when that be agree we be very clear the palestinians have the right just as the israelis do to their own sovereign state where they can live in security we be determined to ensure that recognition at the time when that be most conducive to achieve a state solution which be the right of both those people 
 finally on the subject of the icj my hon friend will be aware that the court ’s determination be a very detailed judgment which it take many month to come to as behove such a judgment it be important that the government consider it in detail that be exactly what we be do and we will update colleague as soon as we have come to a determination on that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the ceasefire remain fragile there continue to be a long road ahead we want the agreement to hold and that mean that each and every hostage must be release in accordance with the term of phase of the agreement and the subsequent phase 
 the video we have all watch of the release hostage be reunite with their family be immensely move we can not even begin to imagine the pain that they have suffer since   october we also hold firmly in our thought the hostage who remain in cruel captivity at the hand of hamas and the family who continue to anxiously await news of their love one the awful news that hostage will not make it home alive must be unbearable for the family 
 we reiterate our call for the government to do everything in their power with partner to push for humanitarian access to those who be still be hold hostage the uk should offer whatever practical support it can to facilitate the smooth release of hostage the testimony of emily damari about the location of her captivity be also very serious and a thorough and independent investigation   be urgently need i would be grateful for clarity from the minister on how the uk government be formally respond beyond call for an investigation 
 on the subject of aid to gaza can the minister give we an update on point what be the turnaround time for british aid the time between it reach warehouse in the region and its enter gaza secondly what metric if any be the government use to monitor the distribution of that aid when it have enter gaza finally since the ceasefire have additional type and category of aid be deliver 
 i be grateful to the right hon lady for all her question but also for the concern that she express about the situation of the remain hostage and their family when i be in tel aviv i have the privilege of meet the brother of emily damari as well as other hostage family and obviously their suffering have be extreme as the right hon lady say it have be particularly harrowing for the family of the hostage who have die i know that the whole house will recognise the pain and suffering that have be undergo by the very large number of gazans who have lose their life a great many people be of course unaccounte for for many of we the situation be unimaginable as we try to put ourselves in the shoe of those return to their former home in some case try to find out whether their family member be under the rubble what a horrific experience they must be go through 
 the right hon lady ask question with which i will deal in a moment but she also rightly press i on the issue of emily damari ’s captivity and the allegation that she have be hold in unrwa facility commissioner lazzarini the head of unrwa have say that claim that hostage be hold in unrwa premise be disturbing and i agree with he i welcome unrwa ’s call for independent investigation of any misuse of its facility and indeed there have be investigation previously the colonna review investigate other allegation and the uk have work with unrwa to ensure that those investigation be thorough and that the appropriate change be make 
 let i turn to the right hon lady ’s question she ask about the turnaround time for uk aid get into gaza certainly we have see a far speedy throughput but i be sure that she would agree that we need to see commercial shipment of good get into gaza that be necessary if there be to be delivery of food and other supply on the scale that be require we continue to push the government of israel to enable that to happen as quickly as possible as for the metric be use when it come to the distribution of that aid we be work closely with trusted partner and as the right hon lady would expect we continuously monitor the distribution of uk supply much of our activity have be undertake jointly with other country as well as with un agency and we work closely with they to ensure that aid be deliver where it be need 
 lastly the right hon lady ask whether there have be a change in type of aid we need access for tent in particular as well as other form of shelter and medical supply when i be in jordan i see medical supply that it have not be possible to deliver to gaza and we need access for those we have see improvement in some area but give the scale of the challenge we   need to see further improvement especially in relation to water and sanitation where there have be a great deal of destruction urgent action be need to improve the position 
 rise 
 to those member who be minute late please do not embarrass each other by stand 
 we have see a really worry escalation of violence on the west bank just at the time when this fragile peace have be find in gaza large part of jenin refugee camp have be completely destroy by israeli security force and thousand have be forcibly displace unrwa service have be interrupt what measure be the minister take to ensure that palestinians can live safely and securely in their home on the west bank 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue she have considerable expertise in the area of humanitarian support as do many other member in the chamber as i say in my previous response the uk be very concerned about the situation in jenin which we continue to monitor very carefully we be clear that peace and stability on the west bank be in everyone ’s interest it be in the state of israel ’s interest and in the interest of palestinians on   december in a statement at the un security council meeting on the occupied palestinian territories the uk call on israel to stop illegal settlement expansion on palestinian land and we be consider all option for take further action 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 president trump ’s proposal for the forced displacement of gaza ’s inhabitant would constitute a grave violation of international law and threaten the fragile ceasefire and the return of the hostage will the minister condemn they 
 the palestinian people have a right to self determination and to a state of their own as have be british policy for decade so will the government finally commit to an immediate recognition of a palestinian state along the border the welcome ceasefire have give we the opportunity to flood gaza with aid but the freeze to us aid funding be reportedly impact the humanitarian response non governmental organisation be be force to lay off aid worker what have the impact be on the humanitarian response in gaza include on british fund programme and what conversation be the government have with our american partner to persuade they that abolish us aid would be a dire mistake 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for the important point she raise the uk ’s position on the right to return could not be clear i quote the prime minister ’s remark which be most definitely that palestinians must be allow to go back to their home and community in gaza and must be allow to rebuild that be in line with international law there be no doubt whatsoever about the uk ’s position on this 
 the hon lady ask about the position on recognition i respond to that when answer my hon friend   the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy   mcdonald the uk have be clear that we believe it be important that both palestinians and israelis have the sovereignty that be require for they and the security that be necessary in order to live in peace we will ensure that the uk ’s decision on recognition be a contribution to the process towards a state solution which we desperately need to see 
 finally the hon lady ask about us aid i be grateful to she and other members for come to our briefing yesterday with the minister for the middle east my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer in which we cover this matter the uk note the us decision to pause foreign aid funding for month pende a review there have be a lot of commentary about that it be a fast move situation and we be monitor it very closely indeed as the hon lady would expect of course this be a matter for the united states the uk be very clear that we must continue to do what we can to support people in gaza must provide life sustain support and must work with a whole range of partner on this and we will continue to do so 
 vast swathe of infrastructure in gaza have be destroy what work be the government undertaking on support the palestinian people to rebuild their home and community as be their right under international law 
 this be a critical issue of course we need the ceasefire to be hold to as i say we have to move through phase to phase and but we also need to ensure that there be day after next phase planning in gaza so that we can see the building up of gaza ’s governance and security institution and of course infrastructure as my hon friend rightly state we be clear that gaza ’s recovery and reconstruction must be palestinian lead we have support the palestinian authority in particular on this i be very proud that uk expertise have be support that work so that this important reconstruction can continue at the require pace and scale but we need to see the ceasefire hold to enable that 
 what practical support be the government give to egypt now that the rafah crossing have reopen for medical emergency when that happen previously it put enormous pressure on the egyptian health service and cause some civil unrest in egypt as the right hon lady know egypt be also under pressure on its southern border due to the conflict in sudan do she agree that support for egypt at this critical time be very important 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for underline egypt ’s role in this incredibly difficult humanitarian situation and particularly in relation to medical evacuee from gaza he be also right to underline that egypt be now house many refugee from sudan too 
 i reassure the right hon gentleman that the uk be seek to work with egypt we have support the egyptian ministry of health and population with £ deliver through who egypt to support medically evacuate palestinians from gaza we be explore further support for the egyptian system which be gear up to receive large number of medical evacuee 
 the world be watch so let we be clear in this house that the   uk ’s reaction to this brazen attempt to far rip up international law will echo for generation with palestinians kill the ceasefire hang by a thread and now a blueprint to ravage gaza ethnically cleanse palestinians and resettle the land where exactly have diplomacy and refuse to sanction israel lead we palestinians be now face mass expulsion reoccupation and resettlement all while the international rule base order have be rip to shred 
 i believe it have be incredibly important for the uk to engage diplomatically in relation to this conflict it be absolutely right that we have seek to work with partner on these issue that we have support statement within the un security council that we have work with partner in the region that we have seek to achieve change and that we seek to ensure the ceasefire be agree 
 we need to see more hostage release we need a surge of aid into gaza and ultimately we need to work with other country towards the state solution that be so necessary i believe our work have be important and i believe that member would not have forgive the uk government if we have not engage determinedly with those action 
 my hon friend ask about the uk ’s position particularly on the right to return we have state very clearly include at the high level with the prime minister ’s statement yesterday that those who be walk through the rubble to get back to their home and community in gaza must be allow home of course in say that the prime minister be restate international law 
 do the minister accept that we get here after month of weakness and vacillation by both this government and the previous government as we contemplate the hundred of thousand of people who be return to their home to dig out their relative from under the rubble the welcome return of the hostage and the odd orphan and even more amputee do she recognise that the hot air we have hear from both government frankly get we to a situation in which the israelis be demolish building in jenin with people still inside and in which the president of the united states be openly contemplate the forcible transfer of palestinians 
 if the right hon lady accept that vacillation will she confirm a couple of thing for the avoidance of doubt be arabs and palestinians in particular entitle to the same protection under international law as everybody else secondly do we still affirm our support for un security council resolution which guarantee the palestinians safety security and sovereignty in their own land if so when will she stop just talk about it and actually take action to enforce these matter in law 
 as the right hon member be aware and as we have discuss previously this uk government have take a different approach from the previous government on matter of accountability we be very clear that the uk ’s arm export regime have to be hold to and operate in line with international humanitarian law that underwrite the decision we take in the autumn   we say we would examine that regime and deliver on it and we examine that regime and suspend a number of licence he be also aware about the new uk government ’s different position on the legitimacy of the international criminal court the international court of justice and unrwa and he be aware that we resume fund for unrwa 
 i do not want to labour the point because so many hon member want to ask question but it be important that the uk have engage in diplomacy and seek to work with our partner i believe hon member would expect the uk government to do that and to engage with the un on these matter rather than to walk away i would underline that international law be universal it must be that be its found principle it operate regardless of circumstance or which population and individual we be talk about on the right hon member ’s last point we have be very clear about the right to return 
 the television footage of many thousand of palestinian man woman and child walk back to northern gaza be a powerful reminder not just of the forceable displacement they have already suffer but of the extraordinary resilience of that people that be why there be real anger among palestinians today that yet again the very existence of their homeland be be subject to the whim of another colonial power i be pleased that the minister have confirm that the uk have an unshakable policy on the right of return of those palestinians to rebuild their home and their life but would she agree with the un secretary general who say today that stay true to international law be 
 essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for again raise the image that so many of we have see on our television screen of palestinians return to their home in gaza as the prime minister explain in many case they have no choice but to walk back to their home because of the destruction of road and other infrastructure but many of those home have be destroy my hon friend be right that the experience of displacement have be feel by very significant number of gazans up to of gazans have be displace at least once and some up to time to underline yet another time the uk ’s commitment to international law be very clear the prime minister and the foreign secretary have restate that and i restate it again today 
 i be grateful to the minister for her response to my hon friend   the member for esher and walton monica harding   on usaid and grateful to know that the impact assessment of the us government ’s decision about usaid be ongoing particularly in relation to the humanitarian situation in gaza as part of that assessment should the government consider a return to of gross national income for overseas development assistance if the us be no long a reliable global partner then surely the uk should be 
 on a return to of gni be spend on overseas development the hon lady will be aware that my party ’s position the position of the government be that we be determined to return to   that level of spending as fiscal circumstance allow we be clear that we must play a part in humanitarian question and more broadly on development we must seek to work in partnership with other country we be do that and have ensure that have feed into our decision for next year ’s year spending review and that will be the case for the long term spending review as well 
 the prime minister be quite clear when he say at that dispatch box that the right of gazans to return and remain on their land be absolute as they return there be many hundred of thousand of psychologically and physically damaged child which be unprecedented in recent memory what can we the british state do to help they 
 i know that my hon friend will be concern about this issue give his considerable medical expertise the uk have be act to ensure that we be do our part to support child in gaza and we will continue to do so we be have urgent discussion with our partner on this and those discussion extend to the concern issue around psychosocial trauma that have be experience by child and ensure that those vulnerable child receive the support that they need in the future 
 it be welcome news that some hostage have be release but the shocking scene that we have see of brave young woman surround by terrorist demonstrate that hamas be still in charge in gaza the question now turn to how we ensure that the palestinian people can return to safe and secure home that the terror tunnel be destroy and that hamas play no part in the governance of gaza give that hamas be in charge and that president trump have make an announcement about how all this could be do what will the british government do to come up with a counter proposal that be both reasonable and achievable 
 i share the hon member ’s concern about those scene and i be sure that other member in the house do so as well the uk government have be very clear hamas must not play a part in those future governance arrangement we have be seek to work in a practical manner with the palestinian authority especially make sure that they have the expertise that they need for their reform programme and work towards the reconstruction and recovery that be so important in gaza 
 the minister be right to say that the past month in gaza have be a living nightmare and that we need a safe and secure palestine alongside a safe and secure israel i agree absolutely that there must be no forced displacement of gazans will the minister say more about how we be focus on the key issue here which be how the uk be support a ceasefire and the rebuilding of gaza 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her important question the uk have seek to invest in the ceasefire that be the reason why just last week we announce additional humanitarian support and   support in relation to much need service in gaza so that we could ensure that that surge in aid which be so necessary be not just there now but sustain that be important so that we can progress from phase of the ceasefire to phase then phase and ultimately towards a state solution 
 no amount of row back by the us state department can change the fact that what the united states president intimate early this week amount to ethnic cleansing be the uk government of the same view that if prosecute his plan would amount to ethnic cleansing if not what do the uk government understand ethnic cleansing to be i have hear an awful lot of warm word from the government and ambition about what we believe in what we stand for and what we have deliver around the immediate humanitarian crisis but let we not forget that the horror that have happen over the past month be due to the vacuum create by international inaction over the plight of the palestinians for the last year what will this government do to change that drastic situation 
 a few moment ago i list the decision that the uk government have take that be different from those of the previous government we have be determine to ensure that we be very clear about the jurisdiction of the international criminal court and the international court of justice we have also remove that ban on unwra funding and support move at the un through the security council that have be specifically focus on try to push forward the state solution that be so important i refer the hon gentleman to my previous remark about the prime minister himself underline the importance of that right to return 
 yesterday we welcome the prime minister ’s comment about how the palestinians must be allow home and must be allow to rebuild we should be with they in that rebuild and on the way to a state solution yet settler violence against palestinians continue to increase will the minister confirm that this government have no intention of lift the sanction that the uk have impose on israeli settler and settler group and will the government even consider expand they 
 my hon friend will be aware that the uk have impose i believe it be in the autumn sanction against those who have engage in and promote violence as settler we condemn that activity and believe that it reduce the prospect of a state solution of course for i to talk about future sanction designation from the dispatch box would reduce their efficacy and therefore i will not do that here 
 i thank the minister for the clarity of her answer today we be all aware that iran play a major role through its antisemitic regime in fund hamas and hezbollah with the stated aim of destroy the state of israel if there be to be faith in the reconstruction of gaza people who want to do that will have to have faith that there be a secure situation the attitude of this white house towards iran be different from the previous what   action be the government take and how be they involve in ensure that iran be not able to re establish itself to fund and arm the group that specifically want to destroy the state of israel 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for his comment the uk government be clear that iran have long destabilise the middle east that have obviously be do through military mean but it have also give financial and political support to its proxy and partner include iranian align militia group in iraq and syria hezbollah in lebanon which he mention and the houthis in yemen we will continue to work with international partner to encourage de escalation long term peace and security in the middle east can not be achieve without address iran ’s destabilising activity the uk government be clear on that 
 trump have lift the lid on israel ’s real plan the ethnic cleansing the forced displacement of palestinians nobody can claim any long that they do not know or do not know what be go on a genocide all the warm word in the world about a state solution will not stop it only sanction will as the world ’s top court demand that mean ban on israeli settlement good enter this country it mean sanction on trade and an arm embargo without do that people in this house will never be able to say that we do everything we could to stop these crime that will echo down the generation will the minister confirm that the government will finally treat israel as they have rightly treat russia and impose widespread sanction 
 on my hon friend ’s question about force displacement i be very clear early about the fact that the uk government be absolutely determined to ensure that there be not force displacement that would be contrary to international law gazan must be allow home and in the word of the prime minister himself 
 must be allow to rebuild”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 my hon friend ask about the situation in relation to arm export he will be aware that on   september   we suspend a number of export licence to israel for use in military operation in gaza and i refer he to my previous response on sanction designation 
 president trump ’s comment early this week be grossly irresponsible and dangerous do the minister recognise that forcible displacement of a population under occupation constitute ethnic cleansing and be a war crime will she clearly and unequivocally condemn the remark of president trump will she recognise the state of palestine as an essential step to the long term sustainable peace that she have articulate support for
