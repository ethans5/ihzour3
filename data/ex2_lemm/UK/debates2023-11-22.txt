 the amendment make by this resolution come into force at pm on   november

 as a country we be in a very different position from the we be in a year ago back then the office for budget responsibility and the bank of england be predict a recession but we have have growth debt be predict to rise almost of gdp by the end of the forecast but headline debt be now predict to be more than low rather than fall average real income have rise 
 none of that happen by accident it happen because of the difficult decision we have make which have turn the economy around we have learn the lesson of what happen a year ago but the opposition have not today we set out a plan for the economy that will grow our potential reduce debt and reduce taxis yet all labour want to do be reverse this progress by borrow £ it be the same old labour party 
 let i begin with what we have achieve 
 my right hon and learn friend be right to highlight the issue a number of thing have be say about this matter that be not the case the money will be make available in northern ireland and it have be set aside if memory serve it be about £ but i would need to double check if i be incorrect i will write to he the reality be that we need decision to be take by a restore executive and the government be keen to work with northern ireland ministers to that end i be grateful to he for highlight this point and give i the opportunity to say that the money will be spend in northern ireland 
 i refer to my previous answer about the considerable support we be provide to family across the united kingdom with their energy bill the hon lady mention scottish business and it would be good if the scottish national party realise that it should support the people employ in scotland ’s north sea oil and gas industry 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the cost of childcare on family income in northern ireland 
 whether he plan to provide increase funding for childcare in northern ireland 
 early education and childcare be devolve matter so policy and spending decision be for the northern ireland executive it be vital that a new executive be form to ensure that all available funding be use to maximum effect in northern ireland 
 the minister know that free childcare be not available in northern ireland but be he aware of the serious consequence that people across the north be face particularly woman childcare be extremely expensive in northern ireland the most expensive outside of london so something really need to be do rather than tell i that this be just a matter for the executive who be not even sit can he tell i what he be do right now to secure free childcare for those woman and who be he speak to about it 
 i know that the hon lady do not mean to implore i to ride roughshod over the belfast good friday agreement but we need to abide by the devolution settlement in that agreement northern ireland have its own childcare system and it be the responsibility of the northern ireland executive and the northern ireland department of education to put in place the much need policy for childcare support that the hon lady quite rightly raise successive executives have not prioritise funding for childcare provision equivalent to that in england despite have funding to do so through barnett consequential so i hope she will join with i in say to an executive which of course we hope will be restore that they really do need to take care of childcare 
 give that a post on the prime minister ’s no instagram account this week celebrate northern ireland ’s business with the irish tricolour do the minister think that parent would get a well child deal with the republic 
 i be confident that somewhere there be a junior communication professional lament the fact that they accept the automatically generate flag on that instagram post and i do not wish to deepen their embarrassment by go far the hon gentleman will have notice that i be proud to put out on my own instagram the lapel pin that i be currently wear 
 what recent discussion he have have with business in northern ireland on the implementation of the windsor framework 
 what recent discussion he have have with business in northern ireland on the implementation of the windsor framework 
 yesterday be the anniversary of the birmingham pub bombing that kill people and injure the deadly act of terrorism in england during the trouble at this juncture we should remember those who lose their life and in this year of the belfast good friday agreement it be important to remind ourselves of the progress that have be make since 
 i recently attend a roundtable with the northern ireland institute of directors and i meet regularly with northern ireland business to discuss a whole range of issue include the windsor framework official across the uk government be also in regular contact with business about implementation of the framework we have continue the ongoing implementation of the windsor framework roll out the phase of the green lane on   october cut red tape and lift ban on everyday product 
 i very much welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to business in northern ireland could he tell the house how many of they be now register with the uk internal market scheme 
 i be happy to confirm that more than business have now register with the uk internal market scheme of which over be business that do not benefit from the previous scheme all of those business can now move their good free from any costly issue and tariff in the future business register under the scheme will also be able to avoid complete custom declaration as we continue implementation of the windsor framework 
 do the secretary of state accept that for as long as there be custom declaration physical search and id check for business move good from great britain into northern ireland even in the green lane the prime minister ’s view that there be no 
 sense of border in the irish sea 
 will ring hollow 
 with the great respect to my hon friend i do not accept that when we agree to the windsor framework we commit to a certain number of eu law be maintain in northern ireland which have be of economic benefit to northern ireland even up to this point and will continue to be in future pretty much everybody involve in movement across the irish sea the business involve include the new business use they believe that they be simple and very straightforward 
 i call the dup leader 
 far to that excellent question from   the hon member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis our objective be to ensure that northern ireland ’s place in our big market the united kingdom be restore and protect in law will the secretary of state work with we to ensure that where good be move from great britain to northern ireland they be not subject to eu custom process that be neither necessary nor fair and right save for reason of animal health and the risk of smuggling there should not be check on those good 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question and i very much enjoy work with he on a regular basis to try to achieve the aim he have set out we have so far go a long way in this space with the windsor framework but i look forward to continue engagement with he in the next few day because we do need to find a resolution to these issue that also mean we can re form stormont and deal with the other domestic issue in northern ireland 
 i thank the secretary of state for the additional support that have be provide to business affect by flooding in northern ireland will he work with we to ensure that whatever additional support be require for the recovery of town such as downpatrick newry and portadown be deliver by northern ireland departments work together with the northern ireland office 
 i would like to thank the local council and the northern ireland civil service for the work they have do on this so far the flooding which i know we will talk about a bit later be extraordinary and so many people be affect who do not expect to be some £ have be assign for that at this point in time but the right hon gentleman be quite right to say that the consequence of the flood will have ramification for month and year to come 
 whether he have have discussion with the northern ireland department for the economy on improve the performance of northern irish university as measure by the   impact ranking 
 northern ireland have outstanding university and a high share of its population be educate to degree level my ministerial colleague and i have the pleasure of regularly engage with queen ’s university belfast   and ulster university and we be proud to promote these institution in the rest of the uk and internationally i have glance at the ranking to which the hon gentleman refer and i be look forward to hear his further question 
 be the minister aware that when i be speak on the deck of the titanic centre only week ago i be think about he and the conservative government be he also aware that i be speak to university and local business that be deeply worried about the inability of university and business to get answer from the government to enable they to meet the target of the very important impact assessment from the united nations 
 as keen as i be to keep abreast of the hon gentleman ’s thought i be not aware of his particular insight on that occasion of course we continue to work with the university and the northern ireland civil service and i be keen to work with he on the success of those university what we need above all of course be for an executive to return so that we can work through some of the issue before we 
 staff and student at queen ’s university belfast be do some incredibly impressive work on cyber security what can minister do to ensure that that expertise be deploy to make we a more cyber resilient nation 
 i be most grateful to my right hon friend i have the pleasure of visit the national centre for secure information technologies and i have a particularly interesting time test some of its system i do not think i should comment any far on that particular experience we be always keen to promote its work and i be grateful to she for give i the opportunity to say on the record that it do a fantastic job together with the national cyber security centre i be sure it will continue to promote cyber security in the uk and indeed abroad 
 what discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the potential impact of budgetary constraint on the delivery of public service in northern ireland 
 what discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the potential impact of budgetary constraint on the delivery of public service in northern ireland 
 what discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the potential impact of budgetary constraint on the delivery of public service in northern ireland 
 northern ireland ’s finance be unsustainable i be sorry to say and the departments be face difficult decision to live within their budget that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state have direct the departments use power under the northern   ireland interim arrangements act to launch public consultation on measure to support budget sustainability and raise more revenue 
 i thank the minister for that answer the prime minister announce on monday that of his new key priority be to improve education across these island yet at the same time his government be starve northern ireland ’s department of education of £ we all know that the government love fantasy economic but surely the idea that cut £ from education will improve it be a flight of fantasy too far even for this government 
 my right hon friend the prime minister be right when he say that education be the close thing we have in public policy to a silver bullet but i say to the hon gentleman that the northern ireland fiscal council have acknowledge that northern ireland be currently receive the funding it need through a combination of the northern ireland block grant locally generate revenue and additional uk government funding package those additional package amount to some £ in additional funding since i be afraid that the reality for school in northern ireland be that they be long overdue reform and the cost of run a divided education system be considerable we need to see much more integrated education and much more efficiency to ensure that child get the education they richly deserve 
 recent analysis show that northern ireland ’s budget over the past year have be cut by £ in real term on top of that slow decline the uk government have withhold million in funding force budget cut on northern ireland departments why do the minister think it be okay to punish the people of northern ireland for the political impasse of their representative 
 it be not our view that the people be be punish for an impasse the reality be that the budget situation be difficult for all the devolved nation the hon lady will know that in northern ireland wales and scotland difficult decision have to be take in order to live within our mean this government be take the necessary step to assist the executive in balance the book 
 whoever be responsible for the current stalemate in northern ireland it be not young people in the country ’s school my hon friend   the member for glasgow south west chris stephens   have point to the desperate shortfall in funding be the minister aware that teacher in northern ireland have not have a pay increase for year so effectively they have take a pay cut that be now over can he explain how that will help to maintain the proud record of education in northern ireland that he speak about a few minute ago 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that teacher have not hesitate to impress that point on i when i have be in northern ireland it be a matter that we have under active consideration but i be unable to satisfy he today 
 my right hon friend have mention additional uk government funding and an important element of that be level up bid we on the northern ireland affairs committee note with concern that no northern ireland application be successful in the recent phase can he assure i that a sum of funding be be set aside for northern ireland project if so can he give we an indication of the likely amount be set aside 
 my right hon and learn friend be right to highlight the issue a number of thing have be say about this matter that be not the case the money will be make available in northern ireland and it have be set aside if memory serve it be about £ but i would need to double check if i be incorrect i will write to he the reality be that we need decision to be take by a restore executive and the government be keen to work with northern ireland ministers to that end i be grateful to he for highlight this point and give i the opportunity to say that the money will be spend in northern ireland.[official report   november vol c. 7mc 
 i call the shadow minister 
 follow on from that question community across northern ireland be angry about the government ’s decision to exclude they from the late round of levelling up funding the government have say that be because stormont be not sit but that be a poor excuse because round funding be allocate to project in northern ireland in january this year when the executive be also not in place only £ of the pot of £ have be allocate to northern ireland so far there be a huge additional need in community but million be be hold back as the minister have just say will the secretary of state commit to reverse this unjust decision with immediate effect 
 the hon lady make her point with great force but as i just say to my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland the money will be spend in northern ireland we be keen to work with northern ireland ministers to that effect when it come to the overall level of money require the hon lady will know that we have just put more than £ into peaceplus which will help support northern ireland the reality be that we be work hard to ensure that northern ireland have the funding it need but in order to sort out the problem that northern ireland face we need a restore executive and i be afraid revenue raising we need to be work with northern ireland ministers to make sure that we get the public service reform that be so urgently need 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 may i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s remark on the anniversary of the birmingham pub bombing our thought continue to be with all who be affect by that tragedy to this day 
 the uk government as we have just hear be hold back levelling up funding for northern ireland ostensibly because of the lack of a function executive   however the uk government be seemingly content to bypass the view of the government in place in edinburgh and cardiff in allocate levelling up funding be the point of consistency not about a desire to level up but just that there be a shortage of conservative mps in northern ireland who need to shore up their re election prospect with public cash 
 it be easy to throw out a cheap political line like that but as the hon member have hear i say to my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland   and   the hon member for putney fleur anderson the reality be that that level up money will be spend in northern ireland i can certainly assure he that none of that money have appear in my marginal seat of wycombe even though the whole house will know it be undoubtedly the most deserving and most beautiful constituency in the nation 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the funding for flood recovery in northern ireland announce on november 
 the flood have see devastating consequence for business and household so the government have work hard to come forward with a substantial package that be consistent with our approach across the uk in the absence of an executive we be make up to £ of support available through the reallocation of exist northern ireland funding we have work closely with colleague in the northern ireland civil service and the treasury to ensure that the northern ireland civil service and local council can provide affected business with the support they need 
 i thank the minister for that response he will know that there be real concern about whether that funding be adequate i think he will hear about that in a moment but can i ask about future adaptation and prevention such flood be often talk about as a once in a century or once in a lifetime experience but we know that be not the case from england and that the community will need protection for future occurrence 
 the hon member be absolutely right to raise that she will know that such matter be mostly for the department for infrastructure in northern ireland that be why we be so keen to get the finance on a sustainable basis and achieve the long term change that be need that of course include have a strategic plan for adaptation i hope to have the opportunity in this role to work with a northern ireland executive to those end 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i join the secretary of state in his remark about all those who lose their life in the terrible birmingham pub bombing we remember they 
 last week in downpatrick newry and portadown i see the terrible effect of the flooding on business and household many of whom can not get flood insurance and therefore face huge loss can the minister assure   we that once the initial £ have be pay out to all business from the money that the secretary of state announce during his visit the treasury will approve proposal for the use of the rest of the money quickly so that business affect can receive help and get back up and run again if more be need will he provide it 
 the rest of the money be within the power of the northern ireland civil service to spend because it be reallocate funding alas the treasury be not under my control all i can say be that i look forward to the day 
 i thank the minister for that answer trader will expect to see the money spend there will have to be a review of what happen during the flood to learn lesson for the future include thing such as the need for a warning system there be not currently in northern ireland well flood defence and flood protection which will all need funding in the year ahead in the continue absence of the executive which be really need at a time like this do the minister agree that there should be a review do the northern ireland civil service have the power to establish such a review if not will the secretary of state do it 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman that a review be need i believe that it be possible for the northern ireland civil service to get on with that work under the power that we have give it if it transpire that that be not the case i will write to he and put a copy of the letter in the library he be right the insight he provide be wise and necessary that we all want to work together to see a restore executive because it be for northern ireland ministers to work with their department for infrastructure to deal with such matter 
 what assessment the government have make of the potential merit of introduce a fiscal floor for northern ireland 
 i thank the hon member for the proposal that he and his party have share with i regard these matter as well as those of   the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson i read his article in the irish times early this morning with great interest but he will know that such change be not exactly the silver bullet and will need some negotiation 
 i appreciate that there be a need for a negotiation a fiscal floor be vital to northern ireland can the secretary of state ensure that any fiscal floor be drive by evidence base on the work of the northern ireland fiscal council draw on the work of professor holtham in wales and properly reflect the devolution of policing and justice as happen in around need 
 there be always some debate on the basis of need and the fiscal council outline what it should be in its eye in general principle the answer be yes a lot of conversation be to be have and the fiscal council helpfully publish a report early this year but i remind the hon gentleman that the proposal for wales take over year to negotiate 
 what discussion he have have with the chief commissioner and the commissioner for investigation at the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery since their appointment 
 to update the house sir declan morgan and peter sheridan have be identify as chief commissioner designate and commissioner for investigation designate respectively sir declan commence work in june and peter sheridan be due to start in december formal appointment will take place only once the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery be legally establish the commissioner designate and i have be in contact about a range of issue mainly through correspondence include in lead the search for the remain commissioner 
 i be sure that when those meeting finally take place the secretary of state will take the opportunity to raise the numerous crime commit in the republic of ireland against northern ireland and challenge they over state sponsor terrorism there in his dozen of meeting with sinn féin can the secretary of state explain if he have take the opportunity to challenge sinn féin about its boycott of the institution here when will he ask sinn féin members to come back here and do their job 
 as you would expect mr speaker i meet all the political party and their party leader in northern ireland and here where their party leader exist everyone know the view of this government about people who do not turn up and take the oath in this place but i have to work with all party and will continue to do so 
 if he will have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of allocate additional funding for teach assistant in northern ireland 
 pay policy in northern ireland be devolve and it be not for the government to make those decision i be sure the hon gentleman would agree that such decision should be make by the northern ireland executive with ministers return there 
 i know that the minister have a deep interest in the affair of northern ireland and in the wage of classroom assistant only last week thousand of non teaching staff go on strike from northern ireland school the action be call over an escalating row over pay where thousand of people walk out will the minister commit to investigate that in term of the barnett consequential can he ascertain what can be do to support teaching assistant in northern ireland 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise this issue we be actively consider representation make by trade union he raise an important point and i know that he understand that it be a matter for the executive i hope that day he and i will be able to celebrate some progress on these issue 
 what step his department plan to take to help restore power sharing in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with political party in northern ireland on the restoration of the northern ireland executive 
 i will answer those question from my beautifully tabulate pack our focus remain on deliver for the people of northern ireland who expect and deserve locally elect decision maker to address the issue that matter to they i will continue to engage regularly with the party leader and believe there be genuine willingness on all side to re establish the condition for the devolved institution to go back to work and to thrive 
 we have hear in this house today how disappointed northern ireland be at no successful levelling up bid i visit coleraine football club which be disappoint to be unsuccessful in round be the secretary of state confident that the restoration of power sharing be close northern ireland simply can not afford to lose out on even more money 
 i be glad that the hon lady go to coleraine football club i go there and have a wonderful experience with a great football team i would have love to referee but i be not allow i believe that we be move close to a decision discussion be still to be have and they be continue at pace and at length 
 we have already hear today an example of how the people of northern ireland be disadvantage by the lack of a function executive i would add to that list the deployment of the apprenticeship levy and the reform of the renewable heat incentive do the secretary of state agree with i that civil servant in northern ireland face an almost impossible job in try to steer the ship of state without co ordinate set by the politician elect there interruption 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question and his obvious popularity in the house i agree with he he be completely correct that there be a whole host of issue that require elect ministers in northern ireland to take their place i would like to place on record my thank to the northern ireland civil service for the work they have be do in such circumstance with the limited guidance we have give they because they have be do a sterling job on behalf of the people of northern ireland 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday november 
 i know the thought of the whole house will be with the family and friend of the teenager who die in a car accident in north wales i be sure we will touch on it later but let i just say that we welcome the agreement reach overnight for a humanitarian pause in gaza this be something that we have push for consistently and be a crucial step towards end the nightmare for the family of those take hostage in hamas ’s terror attack and address the humanitarian crisis in gaza 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 today the prime minister ’s government will say that disabled people have a duty to work from home or lose their benefit as if a suitable job of this kind be something that can be conjure up at will it should be obvious to anyone that this kind of punitive policy be not incentivise work it be simply punish disabled people who be already among the most marginalise in our community so can the prime minister do his duty and tell we now how many of the job on the department for work and pensions find a job website be role that specify that you can work from home 
 it would not be right to pre empt the chancellor ’s autumn statement but let i just say this i be proud of the government ’s record in support those with disability not only have we close the disability employment gap and increase the number of employer who be now disability confident we be also make sure that we support those who be most vulnerable in our society not least with the cost of living payment this year which include £ for all those on mean test disability benefit 
 do the prime minister agree that the measure take to get we through the economic shock cause by covid and putin ’s war be right for that time but they be not the blueprint for the long term successful economy of the future it be innovation and skill and investment in they such as the imminent rebuild of harrogate college or the local apprenticeship we have see since those be our foundation and not the fantasy fairytale ten of billion of borrow from the labour party 
 my hon friend be right i be proud that since we have create apprenticeship that be the difference between we we now know that the labour party want to halve the number of apprenticeship if it be in office meanwhile we want to make an apprentice education secretary my hon friend be right labour ’s plan to borrow   £ a year would just push up inflation interest rate and taxis undermine all the progress we have make on the economy it be only the conservatives who will give people the opportunity to build wealthy more secure life for they and their family 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 like the prime minister i know the whole house will welcome the agreement reach overnight we repeat our call for hamas to release all hostage immediately this humanitarian pause must be use to get the hostage out safely to tackle the urgent and unacceptable humanitarian catastrophe in gaza and to make progress to a full cessation of hostility in recent year the international community have treat the state solution as a slogan rather than a serious strategy that must now change 
 like the prime minister i be also sure that i speak for everyone in the house in say that our heart go out to the family and friend of the young man from shrewsbury who tragically lose their life this week it be a living nightmare for any parent and i can hardly begin to imagine their loss 
 this week the prime minister unveil the late version of his pledge for the country let we hope that he have more success with these than he do with the last one do he forget the nhs 
 just week after i become prime minister we inject record funding into the nhs and social care we also unveil the ever long term workforce plan in the year history of the nhs however i be pleased that the right hon and learn gentleman mention the pledge because as he know of they be economic and on a day on which we will focus on the economy i be happy to report that we have indeed halve inflation no thank to the labour party that we have indeed grow the economy and that we have indeed reduce debt that be a conservative government deliver for this country 
 the reason the prime minister ignore the nhs not only in his new pledge but just now be that people be currently on the waiting list that be half a more than when he pledge to bring they down nearly a year ago the prime minister have just claim that this be all about economic growth so let i ask he this if a labourer or a care worker be force to wait a year for an operation how be they mean to help grow the economy 
 we be do an enormous amount to bring waiting list down we be expand patient choice and roll out new community diagnostic centre and surgical hub as well as put more doctor and nurse on our ward when the right hon and learn gentleman talk about target and waiting list i just hope that the welsh labour government be not listen because after year in power they be miss every single of his target be they not mean to be his blueprint 
 more than double the entire population of wales be currently on a waiting list in england the prime minister really need to take some responsibility on his watch people be too sick to work   with the majority also suffer from mental health issue and that be on top of his failure on waiting list can he tell we how many people be wait for mental health treatment 
 we have inject record sum to expand the number of mental health treatment in our country i have talk about the practical thing we be do with community diagnostic centre and surgical hub but the right hon and learn gentleman also do not seem to realise that the union action which he fail to condemn and which his member of parliament support from the picket line have lead to several cancel appointment all make waiting list bad he ask about wales and we can look at it in wales more than people be wait long than month for treatment whereas in england thank to our effort we have virtually eliminate month wait that be the difference between we he want to play politic and we get thing do 
 so raise the waiting list by half a be get thing do it be through the looking glass this i ask the prime minister how many people be wait for mental health treatment he know the answer he just do not want to give it the answer be and be child some be wait nearly year to be see would the prime minister accept delay of that kind if it be of his family or friend 
 of the key thing that we be do to bring down waiting list be expand access to patient choice it be a very straightforward idea to make sure that patient can choose where they be treat and in that way we will bring down waiting list for mental health and other treatment far fast the labour party ’s policy on this be a total and utter mess the right hon and learn gentleman promise in his word to ban nhs use of the independent sector then he say that he want more use of the independent sector and his shadow health secretary agree with that but then the deputy leader of the opposition say that she would end it as ever you simply do not know what they stand for and you can not trust a word they say 
 as ever no responsibility for the shocking state of the nhs the truth be that the prime minister would not accept those wait for his family and neither should anyone else this morning i speak to an nhs nurse for many month cam struggle to find time to see her year old son mikey until he become seriously unwell and now he have not be able to be in mainstream education for over a year mikey ’s mum be have to balance nursing with care and be a parent this be not a off there be family up and down the country in exactly the same situation work hard and try to get through the cost of live crisis while desperately worried about relative who can not get the treatment they need how do the prime minister think they feel when they see he refuse to take responsibility and boasting that everything be fine 
 we be do absolutely everything we can to put money into the nhs to bring down the waiting list because i want family up and down the country to have access to the healthcare that they need   the right hon and learn gentleman be absolutely right they do deserve it but it be incredibly gall to hear this from someone who when there be strike happen in our hospital and people be be deny access to emergency medical care not only do not have the strength to condemn it but refuse to back legislation that would guarantee that access to all the family that he talk about 
 this be on the prime minister ’s watch it be his responsibility year in and all he have to offer be try to blame the opposition for his failure over and over again mikey ’s mum—[interruption i will tell you what mikey ’s mum say to i this morning shall i if you so be interested to hear she say that 
 whatever spin the government put on it you can not hide the reality for ordinary work people 
 those be her word worth reflect on 
 i be glad that in recent year real progress have be make in tackle the stigma surround mental health but the fact remain that the suicide rate for to year old have double since and suicide be now the big killer of man under these be not just statistic every single be a tragic loss to family and to friend politic have the ability to turn this around but it mean tough choice if we be to scrap tax loophole we could have thousand more staff more support in our school more support in our community that would allow we to treat patient on time get they back to work back to their family and crucially give they their life back this be about mental health that be labour ’s plan will the prime minister back it 
 it be this government that for the time in the nhs ’s history ensure that it have a long term workforce plan provide it with record funding so that we could eliminate long wait but also ensure that it have the money that it need to train record number of doctor and nurse while radically reform how they work to improve productivity that be because the only way we will get everyone the treatment they need be to make sure that the nhs have the fantastic staff it need and it be this government that have put that in place the right hon and learn gentleman talk about record this be something that no government have do in the past and it be something that i be proud we have do labour ’s record on this issue be clear it be a disastrous failure of workforce planning those be not my word that be the verdict of the labour chair health select committee it be labour that do not train the consultant that we need now that take or year to train it be this government that be for the time make sure that every family will finally have the doctor and nurse that they need 
 access to housing that local people can afford be the big challenge we face in cornwall while we need to build more house we need to ensure that they be available and affordable to local people and meet the need of our rural and coastal community local knowledge particularly from elect representative be an important part of ensure that we achieve this yet the leader of the opposition have make it clear that his intention be to ignore or override the view of local   people in decision on planning matter can the prime minister assure i and the people of cornwall that under his government the view of local community will play a part in the planning process 
 i thank my hon friend for his excellent campaigning on behalf of his constituent i agree with he that housing must meet the need of local community our affordable home programme be deliver hundred of thousand of home across the country crucially on this side of the house we believe that local community must be consult in contrast to labour ’s plan for top down housing target concrete over the green belt and destroy our precious countryside 
 i call the snp leader 
 i think all of we in the chamber be unite in our relief at report that hostage be due to be release by hamas in gaza but we can not afford to lose sight of what will come at the other side of the temporary pause in hostility that we be about to see at the end of day will we simply see a return to the killing of child in gaza every minute or will we in this house choose instead to back a permanent ceasefire 
 we welcome the agreement reach overnight as i say it be something that we have consistently push for and be a crucial step as we try to resolve this situation and indeed the humanitarian crisis in gaza of course we want to see all hostage release as quickly as possible include british national and i urge all party involve to deliver the agreement in full i also put on record my thank to qatar for its important role we will continue to work with the united states and israel to ensure the safe return of hostage and maximise the opportunity of this temporary pause to step up aid to suffer civilian in gaza it be something that we have push for that we have continue to do and that the uk be play a lead role in deliver 
 ultimately what we need be not a pause in the killing of child but an end to the killing of child and i can think of no well time than now for the prime minister to advocate a permanent ceasefire give that he will not currently do that will he instead lay the foundation for a state solution by finally recognise the state of palestine 
 actually the agreement that have be reach demonstrate that it be not right to have a unilateral ceasefire what be right be to do as we have do and consistently push for a pause that would allow not just for aid to reach the people in gaza who desperately need it but for hostage to be release that be what we have push for and i be glad that that be now be deliver versus a unilateral ceasefire that would have embolden and strengthen hamas 
 our position on the middle east peace process more broadly be clear we support a negotiate settlement lead to a safe and secure israel live alongside a viable and sovereign palestinian state i have speak to president abbas and meet he to discuss this issue and we be clear about strengthen the palestinian authority and reinvigorate effort to find a state solution   our long stand position be that we would recognise the state of palestine when it well serve the interest of peace 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s network north project which will see the full £ put into the midland rail hub that will reopen the central platform at king norton station which have be derelict for so long will he bring forward the cash so that we can increase capacity on the line and improve journey time will he also look at my campaign to extend the new camp hill line to longbridge that would open up access to the new longbridge business park which he visit early in the year and will bring back manufacture job to longbridge for the time since mg collapse in 
 i be pleased that my hon friend ’s constituency will benefit from the decision on high speed and benefit significantly from new network north funding an additional pound to deliver the midland rail hub in full decision about king norton be due to be make later this year which should be good news to he the extension of the forthcoming camp hill line service between birmingham and king norton and longbridge will be assess in due course too i hope that be helpful and i will ensure that the rail minister keep he update on progress 
 i be sure the prime minister will join i and the community i represent in send heartfelt sympathy to the family and friend grieve at the loss of young man in a tragic accident in garreg llanfrothen this week 
 people in north wales pay the high standing charge on energy bill at £ a year a more than in london despite have low average income and live in old poorly insulate house with a further increase in stand charge due next april the prime minister must recognise that he can not leave this to ofgem will his government tackle unfair standing charge before winter set in 
 we have provide an extraordinary package of support for household across the country to help with energy bill total almost £ over the past year or the ofgem price cap have also fall to about £ currently and our price guarantee will remain in place until the spring of next year which will provide further protection for family crucially the chancellor announce previously that we have remove the premium pay by household use prepayment meter until the energy price guarantee end bring their cost into line with those pay by comparable direct debit customer and we continue to provide considerable support for vulnerable family throughout the winter with their energy bill

 that complete prime minister ’s question 
 before i call the chancellor it may help the house if i set out how proceeding on the autumn statement will unfold once the chancellor have deliver his statement copy of the resolution relate to the statement will be make available in the vote office and online i will then call the shadow chancellor and other hon member to ask question this will follow the usual pattern for a ministerial statement at the end of question on the statement the chancellor will be call to move a motion under section of the provisional collection of taxes act the question on that motion must be put without debate 
 we will then proceed to a debate on the autumn statement resolution a minister will move the of the resolution and open the debate the debate will take place over day conclude on monday at the end of the debate on monday the question on the of the resolution will be dispose of the question on the remain resolution will then be take formally without further debate 
 i come today with good news it be my wife ’s birthday and unlike i she be look young every year 
 i turn to the statement after a global pandemic and energy crisis we have take difficult decision to put our economy back on track we have support family with rise bill cut borrowing and halve inflation rather than a recession the economy have grow rather than fall as predict real income have rise our plan for the british economy be work but the work be not do other propose a more short term approach but we have not make unaffordable pay offer to the union we have not stop new oil and gas exploration and we have not increase borrowing by £ a year that would have push inflation up just when we need to bring it down instead under this prime minister we take decision for the long term 
 in today ’s autumn statement for growth our choice be not big government high spending and high tax because we know that that lead to less growth not more instead we reduce debt cut taxis and reward work we deliver world class education we build domestic sustainable energy and we back british business with growth measure do not worry i be not go to go through they all—[interruption well i will if you like in summary they remove plan red tape speed up access to the national grid support entrepreneur raise capital get behind our fast grow industry unlock foreign direct investment boost productivity reform welfare level up opportunity to every corner of the country and cut business taxis 
 the office for budget responsibility say that the combined impact of these measure will raise business investment get more people into work reduce inflation next year and increase gdp but conservative also know that a dynamic economy depend on the energy and enterprise of people more than any diktat or decision by minister so today ’s measure do not just remove barrier to investment they reward effort and work i will go through the measure in part in the i will use update obr forecast to show the   progress that we be make against the prime minister ’s economic priority the part will set out growth measure to back british business finally i will conclude with measure to make work pay 
 before i start with the forecast i want to express my horror at the murderous attack on israeli citizen on   october   and the subsequent loss of life on both side i will remember for the rest of my life as i know many other hon member will be take to auschwitz by the rabbi barry marcus and the remarkable holocaust educational trust i be deeply concerned about the rise of antisemitism in our country so i be announce up to £ over the next year for organisation such as the holocaust educational trust to tackle antisemitism in school and university i will also repeat the £ uplift to the community security trust when it come to antisemitism and all form of racism we must never allow the clock to be turn back 
 i now move on to the obr ’s economic and fiscal forecast and i thank richard hughes and his team for their sterling work in prepare they of my right hon friend the prime minister ’s pledge at the start of the year be economic to halve inflation grow the economy and reduce debt today i can report to the house that we be deliver on all 
 let ’s start with inflation the shadow chancellor do not mention it in her conference speech my conference speech be before her so all she have to do be a bit of copying and pasting which i have hear she be good at but it speak volume that during the bad global inflation shock for a generation it do not even get a mention well if control inflation be n’t a priority for labour it be for we 
 when the prime minister and i take office inflation be at last week it fall to we promise to halve inflation and we have halve it core inflation be now low than in nearly half of the economy in the eu and the obr say that headline inflation will fall to by the end of before fall to the target in i will not take risk with inflation and the obr confirm that the measure i take today make inflation low next year than it would otherwise have be i thank the independent bank of england monetary policy committee for its crucial role in bring inflation down and we will continue to back it to do whatever it take until the job be do but as we do we will continue to support family in difficulty and today i add further measure to help with the cost of living 
 for those on the low income i understand the concern some have about the effect on work incentive of match benefit increase to inflation and i know there have be some speculation that we would increase benefit next year by the low october figure for inflation but cost of living pressure remain at their most acute for the poor family so instead the government have decide to increase universal credit and other benefit from next april by in line with september ’s inflation figure an average increase of £ for household next year vital support to those on the very low income from a compassionate conservative government 
 secondly because rent can constitute more than half the live cost of private renter on the low income i have listen closely to many colleague as well as the   institute for fiscal studies the resolution foundation citizens advice uk and the joseph rowntree foundation who say that unfreeze the local housing allowance be an urgent priority i will therefore increase the local housing allowance rate to the percentile of local market rent this will give household an average of £ of support next year 
 thirdly although i be go to increase duty on hand roll tobacco by an additional above the tobacco duty escalator i know that for many people go to the pub have become more expensive i have listen closely to the persuasive argument on alcohol duty from my hon friend   the member for moray douglas ross   and my right hon friend   the member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell fierce champion of the scotch whisky industry i have also listen to defender of the great british pint such as my right hon friend   the member for vale of glamorgan alun cairns   and my hon friend   the member for buckingham greg smith to councillor jane austin who be a big supporter of the jolly farmer pub in bramley in my constituency and indeed to the sun newspaper so as well as confirm our brexit pub guarantee which mean the duty on a pint be always low than in the shop i have decide to freeze all alcohol duty until   august   next year that mean no increase in duty on beer cider wine or spirit 
 finally pensioner the triple lock have help to lift old people out of poverty since it be institute by a conservative government in and have be a lifeline for many during a period of high inflation there have be report that we would uprate it by a low amount to smooth out the effect of high public sector bonus in july but that would have be particularly difficult for pensioner whose only income be from the state 
 so instead today we honour our commitment to the triple lock in full from april we will increase the full new state pension by to £ a week worth up to £ more a year that be of the large ever cash increase to the state pension show that a conservative government will always back our pensioner 
 include today ’s measure our total commitment to ease cost of living pressure have rise to £ that include pay around half the cost of the average energy bill since last october and amount now to an average of £ per household we be able to do that only because we reduce the deficit by ahead of the pandemic which the labour party might reflect on have oppose we every step of the way 
 next i turn to my right hon friend the prime minister ’s pledge to reduce debt before i take difficult decision at last year ’s autumn statement debt be predict to rise to almost of gdp by the end of the forecast since then the economy have outperform expectation and i have take difficult decision to reduce borrowing as a result headline debt be now predict to be of gdp by the end of the forecast 
 the obr today forecast that underlie debt will be of gdp next year in and in before decline in the final year of the forecast to in that be low in every year compare with forecast in the spring we therefore meet our fiscal rule to have underlie debt fall as a percentage of gdp in the final year of the forecast with double the headroom compare with the obr ’s   march forecast we will continue to have the low government debt in the g7 low than the united states canada france italy or japan 
 i turn to borrow   the right hon member for leeds west rachel reeves   say that when it come to borrow she will take it up by £ a year indeed she have oppose every decision we have make to reduce our borrowing the government will bring borrow down because as the late lord lawson say borrowing be just a deferred tax on future generation 
 i see the leader of the opposition shake his head in fact we have something in common both he and i want to make a jeremy prime minister in fairness his party and mine be probably equally relieved that we fail but whereas this jeremy be grow the economy his jeremy would have crash it 
 the number show the contrast accord to the obr borrowing be low this year and next and on average across the forecast by £ every year compare with the spring budget forecast it fall from of gdp in to and in that mean we also meet our fiscal rule that public sector borrowing must be below of gdp not just by the final year but in almost every year of the forecast 
 some of that improvement be from high tax receipt from a strong economy but we also maintain a disciplined approach to public spending as i set out in the spring budget resource spending will increase by a year from in real term and we be sustain the record increase in capital spending in cash term until the end of the forecast within this we will meet our nato commitment to spend of gdp on defence critical at a time of global threat to the international order most notably from putin ’s evil war in ukraine 
 we also support a group of people to whom we owe our freedom our brave veteran i will extend national insurance relief for employer of eligible veteran for a further year and provide £ to support the veterans place pathways and people programme i thank our excellent minister for veterans affairs my right hon friend   the member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer for his championing of their cause 
 we have show that we be prepared to increase funding for vital public service with record number of police officer doctor nurse and teacher we be nearly double the number of doctor and nurse we train have give the nhs its ever long term workforce plan as i promise a year ago we be also tackle the big single preventable cause of mortality that the nhs have to deal with by bring forward plan for a smokefree generation 
 however alongside extra funding and support we need to see reform we need a more productive state not a big that be why i want the public sector to increase productivity growth by at least half a percent a year the level at which the size of our state start to reduce as a proportion of gdp i have already announce plan to cap and reduce the size of the civil service to pre pandemic level i pay tribute to the excellent former chief secretary to the treasury my right hon friend   the member for salisbury john glen who start our brilliant public sector productivity programme that will now be pursue by his formidable successor my hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott   who have already be with i to meet police fire and ambulance personnel to understand why bureaucracy be hold they back 
 through that vital work we will ensure that over time the growth in public spending be low than the growth in the economy while always protect the service that the public value i will also provide his majesty ’s revenue and customs with the resource it need to ensure that everyone pay the tax they owe raise an additional £ across the forecast period 
 my right hon friend the prime minister also promise to grow the economy since despite inherit what be then the bad recession since the world war conservative administrations have preside over fast growth than many of our major competitor include spain italy france—[interruption well the opposition do not like to hear this but let i tell they the list spain portugal france italy netherlands austria germany and japan we have grow fast than all of they since 
 however all those country have face a pandemic and an energy shock as a result last autumn the obr forecast a recession in which the economy would shrink by this year instead it grow in fact it have grow fast than the euro area revise number from the office for national statistics now say that the economy be large than it be pre pandemic look ahead the obr expect the economy to grow by this year and next year after that growth rise to in then and in 
 if we want those number to be high we need high productivity the private sector be more productive in country such as the united states germany and france because it invest more on average percentage point more of gdp every year the measure that i take today help to close that gap by boost business investment by £ a year they do not involve borrow more and ramp up debt as some advocate instead they unlock investment with supply side reform that back british business in the following area 
 skill no economy can prosper without invest in the potential of its people despite strong opposition we take the difficult decision to reform our school england ’s to year old be now the good reader in the world and since our to year old have rise place in the oecd ranking for math not least thank to the effort of my brilliant right hon friend   the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb however adult in england still have low basic literacy or numeracy skill so last month the prime minister set out the new advanced british standard to ensure that all school leaver reach minimum standard in math and english 
 while the labour party want to reduce the number of apprentice we want to increase it follow engagement with make uk and other i be announce a furth £ of funding over the next year to pilot way to increase the number of apprentice in engineering and other key growth sector where there be shortage hon member be that it there be of these measure so be patient folk 
 i will move on to planning it take too long to approve infrastructure project and business planning application many business say that they would be   willing to pay more if they know their application would be approve fast therefore from next year work with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities i will reform the system to allow local authority to recover the full cost of major business planning application in return for be require to meet guarantee fast timeline if they fail fee will be refund automatically with the application be process free of charge a prompt service or your money back just as would be the case in the private sector 
 many planning application be for house building the leader of the opposition tell we that he want to be a builder not a blocker that do not last long just   a few month later labour block reform to the   rule on nutrient neutrality shamelessly prevent house from be build conservative on the other hand be the builder with more home be complete in than in any single year of the last labour government 
 today we take further decision to unlock the building of more home we will invest £ over this year and next to deliver high quality nutrient mitigation scheme unlock home we will invest £ to bust the planning backlog and develop fantastic new housing quarter in cambridge london and leeds which will lead to many thousand of additional dwelling we will allocate £ to the local authority housing fund to deliver new home and we will consult on a new permit development right to allow any house to be convert into flat provide the exterior remain unaffected 
 it be also take too long for clean energy business to access the electricity grid so after talk to business such as national grid octopus energy and sse we today publish our full response to the winser review and the connection action plan these measure will cut grid access delay by and offer up to £ off electricity bill over year for those live close to new transmission infrastructure take together those planning and grid reform be estimate to accelerate around £ of additional business investment over the next year 
 next on foreign direct investment i be extremely grateful to lord harrington for his excellent report on how to increase foreign direct investment we accept all his headline recommendation in particular we will put in place a concierge service for large international investor model on the good such service offer by our competitor and we will increase funding for the office for investment to deliver it

 i now turn to measure to support our most innovative industry in the last decade under the conservatives we have grow to become the large technology sector in the world double the size of germany and time the size of france we have the big life science industry in europe and we be europe ’s large generator of renewable electricity after germany and norway and the large manufacturer in the world when it come to tech we know that artificial intelligence will be at the heart of any future growth and i want to make sure that our university scientist and start up can access the compute power they need as such build on the success of the supercompute centre in edinburgh and bristol i will invest a furth £ over the next year to fund further innovation centre to help make we an ai powerhouse 
 our creative industry already support europe ’s large film and tv sector this year ’s all californian blockbuster barbie be film in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for watford dean russell where of course the sun always shin even more could be invest in visual effect if we increase the generosity of the film and high end tv tax credit so i will today launch a call for evidence on how to make that happen

 i turn next to small business i run my own for year and have always know that every big business be a small business once the federation of small businesses say that the big thing i could do to help its member be end the scourge of late payment we pass the procurement act which mean that the day payment term that be already set for public sector contract will automatically apply throughout the subcontractor supply chain but from april i will also introduce a condition that any company bid for large government contract should demonstrate that it pay its own invoice within an average of day that number will reduce progressively to day 
 any small business will also say that the big frustration it face be the tax it pay before make a penny of profit not least business rate the government have already take a of property completely out of rate through small business rate relief we have freeze the tax rate for the last year at a cost of £ we have remove downward cap from transitional relief and for retail hospitality and leisure business we have introduce a year discount on business rate up to £ those measure have save the average independent shop over £ it be not possible to continue with temporary support measure forever but while the standard multipli which apply to high value property will rise in line with inflation i have today decide that we will freeze the small business multipli for a further year 
 follow extensive discussion with the fsb and many colleague in this house i have also decide to extend the business rate discount for retail hospitality and leisure for another year this will save the average independent pub over £ next year and at a cost of £ be a large tax cut that recognise the role of pub and high street shop in our community i thank my hon friend the members for stockton south matt vickers for barrow and furness simon fell and for east devon simon jupp for their tenacious campaigning on this issue 
 finally i turn to the small of all business those run by the self employ these be the people who literally keep our country run during the pandemic the plumber who fix our boiler in lockdown the delivery driver who bring we our shopping and the farmer who keep food on our plate as part of our plan to grow the economy i want to reform and simplify taxis pay by the self employ so today i be announce a major reform of of those taxis it be most people have not hear of but it be a big deal for those who have to pay it 
 class national insurance be a flat rate compulsory charge currently £ a week pay by self employ people earn more than £ which give state pension entitlement today after careful consideration and in recognition of the contribution make by self employ people to our country i can announce that   we be abolish class national insurance all together save the average self employ person £ a year access to entitlement and credit will be maintain in full and those who choose to pay voluntarily will still be able to do so but this change simplifie and cut tax for nearly self employ people while protect the interest of those on the low pay 
 because we value their work i be also take further step for the self employ they also pay class national insurance at on all earning between £ and £ today i have decide to cut that tax by percentage point to from april take together with the abolition of the compulsory class charge these reform will save around self employ people an average of £ a year from april 
 we be back small business by freeze their business rate extend retail hospitality and leisure relief abolish compulsory class national insurance payment and reduce class national insurance by percentage point in today ’s autumn statement for growth small business work so hard for we and a conservative government today be work hard for they 
 i turn now to my final measure to back british business as i have say since we have see the high growth in investment of any g7 country however if we be to raise productivity we need to increase business investment far in my right hon friend the prime minister introduce the super deduction for large business to far stimulate business investment and this spring i introduce full expensing for year this mean that for every £ a company invest it get £ off its tax bill in the very same year 
 the cbi make uk the british chambers of commerce energy uk and other business leader from company include bt openreach siemens and bosch have say that make this measure permanent would be the single most transformational thing i could do for business investment and growth the centre for policy studies say it would 
 maximise business investment boost productivity and deliver high level of gdp 
 but because it cost £ a year i make it clear that i would only do so when it be affordable well with inflation halve borrow down and debt fall today i deliver on that promise i will today make full expensing permanent that be the large business tax cut in modern british history it mean we have not just the low headline corporation tax rate in the g7 but its most generous capital allowance 
 the obr say this will increase annual investment by around £ a year and a total of £ over the forecast period we on this side of the house know that the way to back british business be not to borrow more or subsidise more but to increase the incentive to invest we do that today by introduce of the most generous tax relief anywhere in the world with a huge boost to british competitiveness in an autumn statement for growth skill planning and infrastructure reform pension fund reform support for innovation industry level up back small business and full expensing
