 as be touch on by my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme wave of thousand of young irish woman come to staff our hospital at the birth of the nhs in this country those woman know as the angels of mercy be often overlook but essential to the nhs i spend a lot of time in nhs hospital as a teenager especially the royal london hospital and the royal national orthopaedic hospital my irish dad would often look after i and we would often encounter an irish nurse before i could get treat they have to establish how they know each other it would begin with what county be you from then what town be you from do you know so and so once they have make that connection we be free to get on with our day 
 the irish in britain have maintain that relationship with the nhs ever since and i be really proud that there be more irish staff in the nhs today than staff from any other european country even if we think back more recently to the global health emergency of covid it be an irish woman professor teresa lambe who co develop the oxford astrazeneca vaccine it be then margaret keenan an irish woman from enniskillen live in coventry and a former nhs nurse who become the person in the world to have the vaccine the irish connection to the nhs be really deep and strong and our community be incredibly proud of it 
 however the exhibition also chart the history of how the irish community be receive here which as have be touch on be not always easy alongside the windrush generation and the west indian community it be important to remember that there have be a lot of solidarity between those community it be often treat with suspicion and subject to discrimination include through sign that read no black no dog no irish 
 however the london irish community and the irish community across britain today be a community transform it be confident in the contribution it make to every aspect of life in britain economic political social and cultural the irish community help to make our country the great place it be to live i extend that beyond london to the home county as well my hon friend   the member for read central matt rodda who be here today but can not take part in the debate have long be a champion of irish contribution to read football club and to the reading irish centre which i have be to and which do incredible work to support the irish community in reading 
 as well as celebrate the contribution of the irish community in britain i will touch on a campaign i start in the last few week to secure justice for   survivor of ireland ’s mother and baby home live in britain we often need to remember the reason why lot of people leave ireland and decide to come to britain for some it be for work or to be with friend and family but in the case of thousand of woman who be send to those home for the perceive sin of become pregnant outside marriage it be to escape those institution and the stigma that often come with have be in 
 more than survivor live in britain today both woman and the child who be bear into the institution they be subject to some of the most horrific mistreatment and abuse in those home woman be use as unpaid labour and their child be often forcibly adopt i have name my bill philomena ’s law after philomena lee who i feel bring that story to a global audience in the film philomena in which she be portray by dame judi dench we have an event on an evening night ago in a pack room in parliament to which survivor come and tell their story it be incredibly powerful to hear from they about the impact that that have on they many year later 
 i hope the government will listen to the proposal we be put forward at the moment if the survivor accept the compensation payment they have be award by the irish government but be in receipt of means test benefit they will lose that compensation i hear from survivor this week and that have actually become an additional burden for many of these woman who be now often in their 80 or 90 and some of they be very vulnerable 
 i will go back to the irish in britain we see the pride of the generation irish community of which i be part and the growth of irish culture and its importance right across britain in the growth of the gaelic athletic association it be not just people of irish heritage who get involve but people from all community and background who participate in gaa there be also the irish language people be adopt irish name my cousin jordan and his partner annie have a baby a couple of week ago a little girl and i congratulate they they have name she fiáin which be irish for wild i think she will take after her dad 
 it be common that people be very proud of their heritage often several generation back we have see that in irish music and culture where for year the irish community be subject to discrimination we be now in a period where we can turn on the tv on a friday night and watch graham norton on bbc and derry girls on channel which be a representation of how far the irish community have come we see it in trade union and in the labour movement as well there be a period a year or ago when the general secretary of every single major trade union in this country be either first- generation or generation irish

 transport that meet local regional and national need be vital for deliver this government ’s mission and i be determined that community like   those in newcastle under lyme will benefit the chancellor announce over £ for local transport outside city region at the autumn budget and the secretary of state will confirm the allocation soon 
 a well connect transport system be critical to the local economy a healthy population and a sense of pride in our community however many of my newcastle under lyme constituent in betley bradwell wolstanton audley and the rest of the village have make it clear that they can not access medical or retail service due to a lack of local bus provision hurt our shop and the health and wellbeing of my constituent will the minister come to newcastle under lyme to meet i so that we can establish a path forward to get my constituent the bus service they need 
 while i would always welcome the opportunity to meet my hon friend i urge he to lobby staffordshire county council which will get £ in bus funding in consist of £ in revenue and £ in capital specifically to support and improve bus service and infrastructure across staffordshire include in his constituency 
 what step she be take to support the aviation sector 
 what step she be take to support the aviation sector 
 the government have show that we will support the uk aviation sector by back airport expansion that promote economic growth while meet climate and environmental standard we have invite proposal for a runway at heathrow and introduce a package of measure to encourage the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel 
 aviation be a crucial part of the uk economy with regional airport support job in community across the uk but with many more opportunity ahead will the minister make representation in relation to the industrial strategy both to support the development of hydrogen fuel and to develop the associate infrastructure to make hydrogen power aviation a reality 
 my hon friend be a great champion in this area in addition to the sustainable aviation fuel i mention we recognise the role that hydrogen can play in decarbonise aviation because it literally produce emission at the tailpipe we have invest £ in the advanced fuel fund announce by the chancellor which will also be available for power to liquid sustainable aviation fuel project 
 i thank the minister for his answer as the prime minister point out yesterday stansted airport be a huge employer and training provider for my constituency of harlow what work be the department   alongside the department for work and pensions do with employer and training provider in the aviation sector 
 i acknowledge that my hon friend be a great champion for the airport near his constituency we engage with airport to understand their plan stansted have commit to create over job from its £ expansion and it have establish an employment skill academy in the aerozone to boost career and deliver stem science technology engineering and math outreach i encourage he to carry on engage as he have be do 
 i know that the aviation minister will understand the need for a major diversion field in the south east of england with that in mind and in the light of my question to the prime minister yesterday will he welcome the potential reopening of manston airport in kent in october and the huge investment and growth potential that will create 
 the right hon member who raise this with i while i be in opposition and have now do so while i be in government be a doughty champion for this campaign manston need to come forward with its plan which will be subject to a development consent order and we will then make a judgment about what be in our good interest 
 i thank the minister very much for his answer there be lot of training and employment opportunity for young people in career as cabin crew and pilot or indeed in aerospace and engineering for example at spirit aerosystems in belfast so what can be do work alongside the education minister to ensure that those opportunity be make apparent in school to all the young people who will be the future of our country 
 it give i great pleasure to wish the hon member many happy return on his birthday early this week i think he be actually ask to be retrain in aviation skill laughter 
 northern ireland be a great place for the aerospace industry with its great airport the in belfast and city of derry londonderry which give people a lot of skill there be no limit to what people can achieve by get into this industry in northern ireland and travel the world over practise their skill 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i add my birthday wish to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 significantly muddle message be be send to the aviation sector on the hand the climate change committee upon whose altar the government appear to worship want flight to fall by which be a massive blow to our aviation sector while the government equally say that they want growth and that they want to expand airport who be go to win will ministers stand up to the climate change committee or be we just go to end up with big emptier airport 
 the climate change committee advise we decide we be not go to take any lecture on tough decision i remember when the former member for uxbridge be foreign secretary in he concoct a trip to kabul to avoid a debate on expansion plan for heathrow we be get on with grow aviation in this country 
 if it be tough decision the minister want i invite he to look at what happen in the budget of broken promise air passenger duty go up significantly for example a couple fly to new york will pay £ in tax that be a increase do the minister not see that he need to stand up to the treasury if he be go to stand up for the aviation sector otherwise he be do what socialist always do tax growth out of existence 
 i enjoy the hon member try to polarise the chamber he be sort of all right at it but we be get on with decision around luton stansted heathrow and grow the aviation sector yes tax be an important element but in the past month we have see the big demand ever even before the pandemic in people want to fly that be a testament to the work we be do in government to get on with the decision that should have be take year ago 
 what step she be take to promote active travel 
 what step she be take to promote active travel 
 the government recognise the importance of promote active travel we recently announce almost £ of active travel funding enough for up to mile of new footway and cycleway we will say more very soon on the next step for the cycling and walk investment strategy 
 increase active travel by in england would result in few gp visit and few sick day i therefore welcome the government ’s commitment reiterate by the minister to build mile of new cycle lane and walkway will the minister meet i and the friends of wharfedale greenway to see how we can secure investment to open up this amazing active travel corridor in wharfedale and boost the health of my constituent 
 our investment in active travel will lead to few sick day and million more journey walk wheel and cycle every year more than £ have be allocate to west yorkshire for active travel i would be happy to meet my hon friend i will also ask active travel england to make contact with the friends of wharfedale greenway about that specific scheme 
 early this week i be delighted to welcome st paul ’s youth forum from my constituency to parliament it do amazing work to provide opportunity to young people no matter their background   example of its work be the on bikes scheme which help young people stay active by offer repair and bike loan will the minister join i in celebrate the fantastic work of st paul ’s youth forum and will he consider visit to see its community work in action 
 i be really pleased to hear about st paul ’s give young people cycle skill be so important which be why we be invest £ a year in bikeability cycle training in england active travel be a devolved matter but i be sure my counterpart in the scottish government will consider a visit 
 active travel in eastbourne be be undermine by the poor quality of our road we have pothole on pacific drive upperton road king ’s drive and milfoil drive and poor investment in pedestrian crossing resident in the hawthorns can not cross the road safely on carew road or the avenue will the minister urge conservative run east sussex county council to get a grip of our road and crossing and properly invest hard earn taxpayer money to address those transport challenge 
 i will indeed join the hon gentleman in call on the council to do just that there have be a uplift in the funding to tackle our highway backlog and pothole some of that money can be use on improve walkway and cycleway which be part of the highway 
 woman cycle a lot less than men—71 of woman do not cycle compare with of man safety concern be the main barrier that gender gap be not acceptable what be the government do to address that 
 the hon lady raise a very important question and i be passionate about this issue she will be aware that the government will be bring forward a new road safety strategy the in over a decade part of that will be look at how we can address that imbalance and the perception of and actual issue with safety on our highway 
 what step she be take to help improve road safety for gig economy courier use wheeled vehicle 
 this government have announce a £ road maintenance funding uplift for next year as well as £ for active travel scheme that will improve road condition and safety for all road user include delivery rider 
 wheeled courier work in the gig economy experience more road danger than average rider due to time pressure from employer research from university college london show that gig economy rider be time as likely to report damage to their vehicle and nearly twice as likely to   report injury what step be be take include with employer of gig economy rider and other stake- holder to protect gig economy rider and reduce danger for they and other road user and pedestrian 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that important issue which i know will be familiar to many member across the house in december the minister for local transport write to the main food delivery company to remind they of the importance the government place on the safety of food delivery rider and other road user and to remind they of their obligation it be essential that delivery rider follow the highway code despite the time pressure they be sometimes operate under 
 what step she be take to improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to improve local bus service 
 improve local bus service be vital to kick start economic growth through our bus services no bill and the £ we be invest to support and improve bus service we be take definitive action to help deliver the well more reliable bus service that passenger deserve throughout the country i be delighted to see the result of the recent transport focus survey which show that passenger satisfaction have increase to we can and will do more 
 i thank the minister for his response in watford private bus operator such as arriva change bus route on a whim usually provide less frequent service and sometimes withdraw they altogether that leave hertfordshire county council scramble to plug gap in service through expensive contract do he agree that there must be a well way to run local bus that put passenger and foremost 
 it be vital that passenger have access to a stable and reliable bus network and our bus services no bill include a measure that offer great protection to service from be arbitrarily cancel or reduce alongside our investment in bus include £ for hertfordshire this government be take action to help local leader improve their bus service 
 score of my constituent include carole have tell i they oppose the removal of the no bus service in part of calcot which have mean they can not get to work the supermarket the gp or even the food bank i be proud of our bus service in reading which be a shin example of a locally run service and i be glad to see the government commit to strengthen service far do the minister agree that local route need to serve all those who need they in every part of our community and will he back my campaign to reinstate the no bus in royal avenue and garston crescent 
 i agree with my hon friend and i encourage she to continue to speak with the operator to understand whether change can be make to the route to well meet her constituent need our bus bill alongside the £ for reading and the £ for west berkshire will give local leader the tool to deliver well bus service for passenger 
 local bus service be part of the integrate travel plan for my constituency but my constituent also rely on transport for london to commute into london frustration of my community be that concession fare be offer to london resident who live very close to the hertfordshire border but not to my constituent as accessibility to public transport remain of my top priority will the minister push transport for london to extend those concession to every tfl user regardless of their address 
 that be a devolved matter but i appreciate that tfl also subsidise many route outside that boundary i be happy to pick up that matter with the hon gentleman outside the chamber 
 in my constituency bus service be a lifeline for resident of all age young and old i be shocked to hear at a recent meeting at hereford form college that student this year have have to stop their study because of problem with the reliability and cost of public transport our old resident get free bus travel but our young people do not do the minister agree that it be essential that every young person be enable to access education employment and training will he meet i to discuss how the department for transport can work with the department for education to ensure that all young people can access those opportunity 
 i thank the hon lady for her question the english national concessionary travel scheme provide off peak bus travel to those who be eligible include those with disability and those of state pension age currently however local authority have the power to go above and beyond their statutory obligation area include the hon lady ’s area will receive bus service improvement plan funding which can be use for exactly that but i be of course more than happy to meet she to discuss this far 
 what step she be take to improve passenger rail performance 
 what step she be take to improve passenger rail performance 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of passenger rail performance 
 we be start to see train performance stabilise follow a decade of decline and cancellation be no long   rise we have end the national industrial dispute bring passenger confidence back with a increase in passenger journey furthermore we have make station specific performance information available for the time as a visible sign that we be determined to improve standard 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer in rural town rail link be vital to keep our community connect but many station such as shepley station in my constituency have poor accessibility for disabled and elderly traveller can she offer an update on the department ’s plan to upgrade accessibility at shepley station through the access for all programme and through its consideration of the business case submit by kirklees council to ensure that all resident can use it 
 i can assure my hon friend that accessibility be at the heart of our plan for rail reform although i be not yet able to comment on next step for access for all project at specific station such as shepley in her constituency i assure she that we be committed to improve the accessibility of the railway it will be a priority for great british railways 
 the croydon area remodelling scheme would upgrade east croydon and norwood junction station in my constituency and improve service across the brighton main line and most of the south east however after the previous government withdraw fund for this vital infrastructure project passenger continue to suffer delay and opportunity for growth across the south east remain untapped give the government ’s mission for growth and increase demand for rail service to gatwick airport will the secretary of state look again at the croydon area remodelle scheme and meet i to discuss how invest in croydon ’s transport infra- structure could unlock growth across the south east 
 i be sorry to say that the previous government recklessly over promise on rail infrastructure project mislead passenger who have struggle for far too long to access the service that they deserve in fact i would go as far as say that conservative ministers travel around the country promise rail user the moon on a stick pay for with fantasy money i will gladly meet my hon friend to discuss the croydon area modelling scheme 
 the secretary of state will know about the plan engineering work between didcot parkway and swindon and in the paddington area which will cause significant disruption between london and bristol and in south wales this sunday and next sunday disruption on major route cause massive chaos on the rural route that be access via bristol and far to the south west then there be the closure of the m4 between bath and bristol which mean that there will be no bus between swindon and bristol on those day the alert about long and busy journey and train cancellation and delay advise we to travel the day before or the day after that do not seem adequate will the secretary of state please pull the rail bus and road body together to avoid clash such as this particularly when we face year of further disruption as a result of high speed work which will not benefit the south west in the slight 
 the hon lady make a fair point have readjust my own travel plan for this weekend i feel her pain somewhat this government recognise that sunday performance in particular irrespective of plan engineering work have not be good enough on great western railway and we be work actively to address that gwr be continue to make tactical intervention to improve the resilience of timetabling diagram and rostere i will raise she wide point about join up between mode with official in my department 
 give that in train operate by southern rail arrive at chichester station be late and that there be no fast service connect chichester to london what step be be take directly to improve train punctuality and reliability for my constituent especially consider that an annual ticket be nearly £ 
 the hon lady be right to demand excellent train service for her constituent and that be what this government be determined to deliver we be work with the train operate company on plan to improve timetable and staff availability and rostering i be happy to take away the specific issue that she have raise in relation to chichester and provide she with more detail on the intervention plan on that line 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we be tell that nationalisation be the answer to improve passenger rail performance if that be the case surely it would make sense to start by nationalise the bad perform operator crosscountry come last out of all train operate company for passenger satisfaction and it be not comply with its obligation the secretary of state could call in that contract so why be it not the operator to be nationalise under gbr 
 we make a commitment to bring the train operating company back into public ownership without any cost to the taxpayer the appropriate point at which to bring the train operating company back into public ownership be when the franchise expire if there be terrible performance we can seek to break a contract early i be pleased that there be some improvement at crosscountry we be see improvement from the train operating company that have be bring into public ownership in particular for transpennine and lner there be a really positive story to tell on passenger journey and revenue growth 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer but she duck the point that if she have the political will she could bring crosscountry in house now it be not the operator to come under gbr or even close to it under current plan the government will not get around to tackle crosscountry until in the meantime highly effective private operator with some of the high level of customer satisfaction such as c2c and greater anglia will be subject to dislocate nationalisation this year why be the government force nationalisation in area where current service be like and sit on their hand where people be cry out for improvement 
 i be not sure the hon gentleman listen to my previous answer i say clearly that we be bring the train operating company into public ownership in a way that offer good value for money for the british taxpayer the number of cancellation on crosscountry have reduce markedly since the start of this year and although we recognise that there be more to do crosscountry be on a good improvement trajectory 
 what step she be take to increase capacity on the railway 
 we be committed to increase railway capacity for instance the delivery of hs2 phase will more than double long distance seat capacity between london and the west midland and many project that will increase capacity be be fund through the rail network enhancement pipeline particularly in the north and midland 
 i pay tribute to brian dunsby obe who be a pillar of the harrogate business community he tirelessly campaign to improve our railway include get a direct service from london to harrogate of the issue that we speak about before he sadly pass away be how the leeds to york line via harrogate become a single track at knaresborough which have implication for run high level of service and for delay as once service be delay the entire day can quickly fall i be launch a campaign for the dualling of the line between knaresborough and york so that the railway serve our community be fit for purpose will the secretary of state join i in that will she offer any advice on how we can go about secure that investment 
 may i express my condolence on the loss of the rail campaigner and constituent the hon member mention i be aware that network rail be look at both electrification scheme and potentially long platform scheme for station that serve his constituency but i recognise that he be talk about dual tracking may i suggest that he seek a meeting with the rail minister in the other place to discuss that in more detail 
 my constituent in uttoxeter have no train on a sunday until pm due to long stand network rail staffing issue in signal box with uttoxeter ’s grow population it be unacceptable that resident be leave without transport for much of the day on sunday i thank the rail minister for his engagement with i so far but will the secretary of state say more about how the government be improve the reliability of train service 
 i be clear that we must have a day railway where train be as likely to turn up on a sunday afternoon as they be on a monday morning we be work with train operating company across the country include those that serve my hon friend ’s constituent in uttoxeter and i be happy to provide more information to he in write about the specific action we be take in his constituency 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in south western railway order new arterio train to increase capacity on its rail network they be mean to enter service in however year later only be in service presumably not count the empty that sail by a teem and seething platform at wimbledon this morning with swr set to be in government hand in month what step will be take to ensure that those train be finally bring into service 
 i know that the rail minister be seize of this issue he have speak to i about it and i understand that it relate to issue with lighting on platform what can be see from the cctv camera and the role of the guard we be across the detail and it be important that those issue be resolve before the train be bring into public ownership on   may

 great western railway be currently operate a trial of direct saturday service between bristol temple meads and oxford that call at swindon official be work with great western railway to explore the feasibility of expand the current saturday trial of service between bristol and oxford to other day of the week

 the department be work with the rail industry to improve the performance of rail service in gloucestershire while gloucestershire county council ’s scheme for the m5 junction and a46 in ashchurch be currently be consider as part of the department ’s major road network and large local major programme 
 the government recently announce a uk silicon valley project link oxfordshire milton keynes and cambridge there be no mention of   gloucestershire with its burgeon cyber tech and engineering sector from gloucestershire our primary arterial road eastward to oxfordshire be the a40 and it be woefully inadequate as a single carriageway will the minister meet i to develop improve link eastward from gloucestershire to the benefit of our neighbour in the east 
 yes of course

 i be delighted that our labour mayor of south yorkshire oliver coppard be bring local bus back under public control do the minister agree that take back control of our bus will allow we to deliver on a low carbon future for local transport service what step be she take to increase the roll out of emission bus nationwide 
 i too welcome the step that mayor coppard be take to deliver well bus service for passenger in south yorkshire i know that the minister for local transport be delighted to launch our new uk bus manufacturing expert panel in sheffield early this month which will help to ensure the uk remain a leader in bus manufacturing expand the roll out of emission bus be central to our effort to decarbonise the bus fleet and improve air quality our bus services no bill will accelerate that by require bus operator not to use new non emission bus 
 what step be the government take to address diesel island which be section of track without electrification such as those between reading and my constituency to support the decarbonisation of the transport sector and encourage the transition to clean rail travel 
 the rail minister in the other place be very much focused on how we decarbonise our rail sector a combination of electrification and extended use of battery can allow we to do that i be sure he will be happy to write to the hon lady about the specific of the case she raise 
 what step she be take to improve the accessibility of bus service in kent 
 improve access to local bus service throughout england be a priority for this government our reform through the bus services no bill combine with the £ we have allocate to kent county council in will empower local leader to deliver well bus service for passenger across kent 
 conservative run kent county council recently confirm that £ of the £ grant provide by central government to improve bus service will go solely to prop up exist service that be despite the decline in access to bus service over the past year in kent as key route have be abolish or restrict my constituent in broadmead have no weekend bus service into town for example do the minister agree that that be a shocking indictment of the service that the tories have preside over and that change in may at the local election be how we improve bus service for our constituent 
 i could not agree more with my hon and learn friend i be absolutely clear that too often local bus service be not deliver for passenger right across the country that be why our ambitious reform to bus service include through the bus bill will give local leader the power they desperately need to reform service to well meet the need of passenger include in kent i be proud that our reform to bus funding allocation have mean additional fund for bus across the country unlike under the conservatives who preside over few bus mile in kent alone between and 
 if she will make it her policy to allow holder of category b drive licence to drive community bus 
 i be sympathetic to the hon member ’s concern but to date there be not enough evidence to prove that the repeal of the legislation would not have an adverse impact on road safety since holder of car drive licence have not receive an automatic entitlement to drive minibus this be primarily to improve road safety 
 my constituency be fortunate to have both dawlish community transport and newton abbot community transport they provide vital service for many people who would otherwise be isolate and lonely but like many other volunteer group they be find it hard to recruit recruit driver for their minibus service be a particularly anyone who take their driving test before automatically get a d1 minibus class licence as i do since then young driver have have to take a new driving test the estimate associated training and cost be between £ and £ will the secretary of state work with i to add exception to d1 requirement to cover community transport and other volunteer community group 
 unfortunately up to of driver who take the d1 test fail when we be consider change it be important that safety be at the forefront of our thinking 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help support people to use electric vehicle 
 the government be accelerate the roll out of charge infrastructure it be up in the month to   march   this year we be engage with industry to improve consumer experience include with contactless payment and design standard electric vehicle also receive favourable tax rate with target grant support electric van taxi and wheelchair accessible vehicle 
 some household in county durham include many in my constituency be unable to charge their vehicle at home what support be the government give to innovative local scheme such as kerb charge so that we can make electric vehicle more accessible for all my constituent 
 my hon friend will be pleased to hear that charge point number increase by in rural area such as the he represent and that the north east combine authority receive almost £ from the local electric vehicle infrastructure fund which mean more public charge point for his constituent we be also support cross pavement solution that provide safe charge option for those without driveway as he describe 
 what assessment her department have make of the effectiveness of the roll out of electric vehicle charge infrastructure 
 rose—[interruption 
 it actually follow rather well because 
 order the minister have to answer the question 
 it be lovely that people be so keen 
 charge point availability be increase everywhere as of   march there be over uk public charging device with add to the network every minute but we recognise that there be still regional disparity the local ev infrastructure fund will deliver a further charge point right across england 
 we new boy be still find our way mr speaker 
 my part of the world yorkshire have the low ev charging point per head of the whole country the national audit office have point out that only of charge point be in rural area compare with in london and the south east the net aim will collapse if we do not fix the equitable provision of ev charging point what will the government do to correct those problem 
 the right hon member be absolutely right to raise concern that although charge point availability be increase rapidly there be regional disparity and difference between urban and rural area the local ev infrastructure fund be design purposely to tackle some of that regional disparity as i say charge point in rural area have increase by in the last year the east riding of yorkshire which cover the right hon member ’s constituency have receive £ in levi funding i hope that that will deliver the improvement he seek for his constituent 
 will the minister update we on the emission vehicle mandate consultation when can the sector expect an outcome 
 i know that the global challenge face the automotive industry have be significant over the past couple of month during the zev mandate consultation my right hon friend the secretary of state and i meet of the vehicle manufacturer we be currently consider carefully the representation that they and other have make we will make a further announcement later in the spring 
 what step she be take to support the maritime sector 
 this week we publish our maritime decarbonisation strategy set decarbonisation goal along with policy and regulatory measure to support the sector through the net transition the strategy provide clarity to the sector and will unlock investment in clean maritime technology ensure that the sector be prepare for a emission future 
 the low thames crossing announcement a couple of day ago be a disappointment to many of my constituent will the minister meet i to discuss how we can use a small proportion of the toll to support the maritime sector particularly the tilbury gravesend ferry to reduce congestion and rat run through the village 
 i recently meet my hon friend about her campaign to reinstate the local ferry local ferry be a matter for the competent local transport authority and i call on kent county council to help she in that campaign to re establish the ferry i know that she be work with maritime partner but i be happy to meet she 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i put on record my thank to all those involve in respond to the major incident that we have see unfold on land and at sea in recent week the collision of vessel in the north sea and the fire at the electricity   substation serve heathrow have cause disruption and distress i be pleased that recovery have be swift and i be clear that no stone should be leave unturned either in identify the cause of the incident or in learn lesson for the future 
 i be pleased with the work take place across my department to keep britain move on monday we announce what council need to do to unlock their full share of almost £ of investment to repair our broken road for the time we be ask every council in england to tell we how many pothole it have fix to unlock its allocation as we strive to make our train more reliable i welcome the end of the avanti west coast dispute transport continue to drive the government ’s plan for change unlock job growth and opportunity for all 
 last weekend in my constituency our shrewsbury moves festival celebrate progress towards our year plan to implement more inclusive and integrated public transport across our beautiful medieval town what additional transport be the department make available to historic and economically thriving town such as shrewsbury in order to combat congestion by enable more integrate public transport 
 the aviation minister my hon friend   the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane tell i that he be at shrewsbury moves on his wedding anniversary and have a very good time 
 the integrated national transport strategy will set the long term vision for transport in england different place face different challenge so we want to enable local leader to deliver the right transport for community that will always include good public transport as well as scheme that balance the need of driver cyclist and pedestrian on the road 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 when the government hand the aslef trade union an eye water £ pay agreement in the summer they promise that it would 
 protect passenger from further national strike 
 yet recently the secretary of state say on national television that 
 there will be occasion on which strike will be necessary 
 will she provide the house with an example of a necessary strike 
 the hon gentleman will know that i have extensive experience from my time in london where we do take strike when safety be at risk that be direct example that i can give he 
 the secretary of state will be aware that in response to her department ’s recent rail consultation the trade union welcome her plan and say that a just transition to nationalisation would mean the levelling up of pay and condition for rail worker the cost of that to the taxpayer could be considerable would she consider a strike over harmonise pay and condition to be a necessary strike 
 let we be clear the cost of those national roll strike over year be £ in lose revenue i be sorry but i be not go to take any lesson from the shadow secretary of state on industrial relation on the railway 
 i have launch a petition in my constituency ask warwickshire county council to take our bus back under public control almost of bus do not run on time and my constituent be sick and tired of be strand if they do not have a car do the minister agree that warwickshire county council must do the right thing and improve the dismal service that my constituent be currently stick with 
 we know that too often local bus service be late or bad do not turn up at all block passenger from access vital service our reform to the bus sector combine with that £ investment in bus will give local leader the tool they need to ensure that service truly reflect the need of passenger 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday the chancellor speak about the importance of get individual back to work in order to grow our economy but the uneven coverage unreliability and inaccessibility of our transport network be key barrier that prevent many from do so furthermore the chancellor maintain the decision she take in october to cut the department for transport ’s budget do the secretary of state believe that cut the transport budget be a good way of increase economic growth 
 i know that the chancellor and her colleague in the treasury understand completely the importance of invest in our transport infrastructure to unlock the job home and opportunity of the future 
 people in my constituency desperately need well and fast railway connection across our region and into the north west of england to connect with job and opportunity i thank the secretary of state for her positive engagement with the welsh government and the secretary of state for wales on the topic of rail infrastructure in wales will she meet i and colleague from north wales to specifically discuss the late on the north wales main line 
 i would be happy to meet my hon friend as i say in my letter to ken skates in january we do 
 recognise that railway in wales have see low level of enhancement spending in recent year 
 and we will seek to address that 
 when the roads minister come to norfolk recently she be report to have cast doubt over the approval of the a10 west winch housing access road which be essential to unlock thousand of home and economic growth without the   road the home will not be build give the government ’s commitment to house building will the transport secretary reaffirm her support for this long stand road scheme 
 i be pleased to find myself in norfolk announce huge amount of investment in the region ’s road there be a large number of scheme await the outcome of the spending review but i would be happy to write to the hon gentleman about the specific scheme that he raise 
 electric bike be very popular in my constituency however they travel at high speed with a maximum speed limit of mph and be heavy which be cause quite a lot of distress to many resident they can be speed limit and often be in our park have the secretary of state consider a low speed limit for e bike for safety reason 
 e cycle must comply with the exist regulation which state that 
 electrical assistance must cut off when the vehicle reach mph 
 the police already have the power to seize e cycle and electric motorbike be use illegally and to fine individual who fail to stop when instruct to do so 
 the secretary of state will recognise that it be very difficult for private landowner and local authority along the line of high speed to plan future development when they do not know what will happen to land that be necessary for construction but be not need for the long term operation of the line a land disposal strategy for hs2 be overdue can she produce urgently when she do so will she seek opportunity to benefit community like those i represent which be suffer the disruption of the line but will not benefit from its operation 
 this be a matter that i be seek to expedite as i recognise the uncertainty it cause for landowner and community along the line i will take the right hon and learn gentleman ’s wide point into consideration 
 east midlands railway have a new fleet of train that will be on the track this year a £ investment these train can be power by electrified track but can revert to diesel when travel on the part of the midland main line that be not yet electrify as electrification mean clean air less diesel and quieter and fast train do the secretary of state agree that the more of the track that can be electrify the well it will be for passenger community and the environment 
 i do agree that government investment in new bi mode train and electrification on east midland railway will result in low energy cost a reduction in noise emission and a significant improvement to the railway 
 as the secretary of state will be aware the government move the money earmark for aldridge train station on the   whim of the labour mayor sadly make aldridge resident feel that they be no long care about as the government say that they be minded to grant open access from wrexham to euston will they work with i to demonstrate to the people of aldridge that they do actually care by work to deliver a train station by as plan and budget for by the conservatives 
 i find it rather strange that every month i come to the dispatch box and answer the same question from the right hon lady give that she be rail minister for a number of year i be very happy to discuss the importance of aldridge station with the mayor of the west midlands and to update the right hon lady far 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 yesterday the all party parliamentary group on cycling and walking publish its report on social justice as it impact on vulnerable road user injury to pedestrian could be cut significantly with simple side road zebra crossing without belisha beacon that would align with the highway code change such crossing be common across the world and they be be trialle around the corner from this building at the department for transport will the government consider amend the guidance for highway authority so that these crossing can be roll out across the country 
 the government agree that everyone should have the opportunity to walk or cycle whatever their background and we will obviously study the content of the report in detail which correctly highlight some of the way in which cycle to work scheme for example might be reform the government agree that adapt cycle which be include in the report also play an important role in provide freedom and independence 
 the root cause of the pothole problem be council inability to afford to resurface road wokingham borough council see no uplift in resurface funding for many year with no account take of inflation or new road this be a legacy of the conservative party in government lead to maintenance funding per mile effectively be halve will the minister meet i to discuss the urgent need for fund for resurfacing of new road 
 i be afraid that the hon gentleman ’s local council have suffer the same fate as council across the country as a result of the under investment in local road maintenance under the previous government but they will now have benefit from their share of our £ uplift for the year ahead and they be absolutely encouraged to use that to resurface the road and fix pothole 
 i thank the minister for her answer on the work the government be do with business to support people deal with the consequence of the gig economy and road safety will she join with i in my work to ensure that the area around baker street be safe for resident and will she work with i and   resident around baker street to make the case to gig economy business that we need to do more on enforcement and on the regulation of these worker 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise concern obviously enforcement of the rule on use cycle and e cycle be a matter for the police but i would be very happy to meet she to discuss the issue 
 this week the government have give a commitment to provide extra ev charge unit right across this united kingdom so may i ask the minister a very helpful question what discussion have she have with the northern ireland assembly in relation to expand ev charge infrastructure in the devolved nation how can we help northern ireland scotland and wales to catch up 
 as a departmental team we have regular meeting with our colleague across the devolved government include on issue of how to extend ev charging and i would be very happy to pick that up with the hon gentleman far 
 my constituency have a very successful passenger branch line but there also use to be a freight line there be a tiny piece of track that quite inexpensively could be reopen to carry tin and lithium out through the dock will the minister meet i to discuss the possibility of do that 
 this government be commit to move more freight from road to rail which be the right thing to do for our environment and our economy i would be happy to have that meeting with my hon friend 
 derby station have recently be reveal as the bad for delay in the uk when people can not get to work on time it be not just a pain for they it also impact productivity and hold back our local economy will the secretary of state outline the step she be take to tackle delay train in derby and the east midland so that the transport system support economic growth rather than hold it back 
 we be work closely with east midlands railway and crosscountry to resolve cancellation and delay whether relate to train fleet staffing or infrastructure matter 
 the reduction in funding for our waterway by year on year from will have a detrimental impact on the operation of the dudley canal and caverns trust will my right hon friend commit to a review of the funding of our waterway and reinstate that support 
 i be happy to look into that issue for my hon friend and provide she with a write update 
 i recently meet the manage director of morebus again to call for new service to hengistbury head reinstate service to throop and well service such as an improve route and route to the royal bournemouth hospital and the airport do the minister agree that well bus be good for our community and our economy and that there be a lot of growth to unlock in bournemouth and the south west with well bus 
 my hon friend be a fierce advocate for good public transport in his constituency and i absolutely agree with the sentiment of what he say 
 project willow report back last week among the option be a hydrogenate ester and fatty acids plant produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel and the report recommend a delay in the implementation of the hefa cap be the department currently consider that action 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his commitment to project willow at grangemouth we introduce a mandate from   january so of all aviation fuel have to come from sustainable source we will be legislate on the revenue certainty mechanism and look at how we can contribute to the future of that great site 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions if she will make a statement on the change to personal independence payment and how that will impact those who receive carer ’s allowance 
 the pathway to work green paper set out our plan to fix a broken system provide proper employment support for those who can work and a strong and sustainable safety net for everybody who need it we will change personal independence payment to focus support on those in the great need that change will be in primary legislation with a full debate and scrutiny in parliament the cost of personal independence payment have increase by £ above inflation in each of the past year and those increase be carry on that be simply not sustainable 
 in the green paper we be consult on how good to support those affect by the change to eligibility for example with transitional protection for those no long eligible for pip and for the entitlement link to it include carer ’s allowance as reference in the hon member ’s urgent question and the universal credit carer element which be an increasingly important part of the picture the pip change will be implement from november next year they will apply to new claimant and to people at their award review after that date and those with severe condition who will never work will be protect 
 i pay tribute to the million of unpaid carer across the country we recognise and value their vital contribution provide care and continuity of support include to many people with disability the census indicate that approximately people in england and wales be do some unpaid care as the hon member know we be deliver the big ever cash increase in the earning threshold for carer ’s allowance increase it by £ a week to £ benefit more than carer by our reform will build a system that be fair and more sustainable so that it will always be there for those with the great need to live with the dignity and support that they be entitle to 
 yesterday see the big cut to carer ’s allowance for decade although we need to manage down appropriately the benefit budget that need to be do in a way that be care compassionate and far from rush which be what we see yesterday we be look at approximately carer lose allowance under these proposal half a pound will be take away from those who care the joseph rowntree foundation suggest that some couple will lose £ a year when pip cut and carer ’s allowance cut be take into account while i welcome the apology that the chief secretary to the treasury give yesterday in relation to his reference to pocket money will the minister agree that it be inappropriate to compare cut to pip with cut to pocket money 
 i very much agree that this all need to be do in a managed and compassionate way which be exactly what we be do so i do not agree   that it be be rush as i have say the change will not happen for more than month they will not take effect until november they will not affect current recipient of personal independence payment until their award review after november and review period be typically year so this be definitely not be rush it will happen in a properly plan stag and careful way 
 the hon gentleman refer to couple lose £ i think he must be refer to instance of people who receive personal independence payment and also receive carer ’s allowance for care for their spouse he be right that there be some instance of that there be couple for whom that happen both way the transitional arrangement we be consult on which be refer to in the green paper need to take account of that incidence but it be absolutely the right thing to do to ensure that personal independence payment continue in the long term as part of a sustainable benefit system 
 we do have to make some reduction as i think the hon gentleman acknowledge if he have another idea on how that can be do i be interested to know what it be by concentrate on those whose impairment be the most severe which the propose change will do we will be able to ensure that the benefit be there for the long term and that it be sustainable 
 do my right hon friend agree that in order to safeguard the future of the welfare system we must ensure that it be sustainable 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we have to do that year ago we be spend £ on personal independence payment and this year in current price we will spend £ the government have to address that precisely as he say in order to ensure that this crucial safety net be there for the long term we will not be mean test it freeze it or convert it into voucher as the conservative party suggest we want it to be a cash benefit that can meet the need of those who depend on it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate   the hon member for torbay steve darling   on bring this important matter before the house in government my party support carer we increase carer ’s allowance by £ and with the support of the liberal democrats introduce carer ’s leave we be unite again today in dismay at what this government be do 
 the government have year to prepare their welfare reform we have nothing for month and then everything in a rush because the chancellor crash the economy with growth this year cut in half inflation rise far unemployment up productivity down debt interest soar a record tax burden and people be push into absolute poverty by the measure take by this government they have have an emergency budget contain cut to benefit for disabled people perhaps if they be not in such a rush they would have realise that these crude reform also impact carer some people who give up income to look after a love and who rely on carer ’s allowance to make end meet be now go to lose it 
 the government be balance the book on the back of the people least able to take the weight that be labour make other people pay for the fiasco of their budget they come for the farmer then for the pensioner and now it be the carer the most important people in our society do the most important job a human being can do not for the money but for the love the least the government can do be to give they our support that be what we do in government so why will they not 
 can the minister confirm whether carer ’s allowance be a deliberate target of the government ’s reform or do they not realise the impact of what they be do to pip because of the rush they be in do they think that take £ from carer while give above inflation pay award to the trade union be the right priority and do the minister share the chief secretary to the treasury ’s view that cut support for carer and disabled people be like take pocket money from child be that what he believe carer ’s allowance be pocket money 
 i suppose the hon gentleman have no choice but to attempt to defend his party ’s record in government as i have refer to already the conservative party ’s plan be to convert pip into voucher that really frighten people who be dependent on that system and they also want to make some big cut to the work capability assessment which be rule out by the court as unlawful we announce in the green paper that we be go to abandon those cut for example the conservatives be propose to remove the mobility descriptor from the work capability assessment on the ground that people can now work from home but it be clearly ludicrous to claim that a mobility impairment do not affect a person ’s ability to work i remind the hon gentleman that in respond to the green paper on behalf of the opposition his hon friend   the member for faversham and mid kent helen whately   demand further cut so the outrage he have express be a bit inappropriate 
 we have a proper plan set out in the green paper it have be well think through as the hon gentleman will find if he read it properly include a reference to unpaid carer on its very last page we be well aware of the impact it will have which be why we be consult on the transitional arrangement 
 i thank my right hon friend for come before the house and calmly lay out some of the fact on this matter as i would expect from he give his experience however there have be a lot of fear out there and confusion among mp adviser and most worryingly people who be in receipt of pip and other benefit and be affect by these change do my right hon friend agree that clear communication at all time about this matter be very important and that every minister should be very careful about clumsy and inappropriate language because of the impact it have on the people who be most affect 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the sensitivity of this issue i particularly regret the anxiety that have be cause by press speculation over the past several week that have certainly be regrettable from my postbag the thing that particularly   frightened people be the point i have already refer to which be the previous government ’s proposal to switch pip from a cash benefit to voucher that cause a great deal of concern but my hon friend be right we now need to be absolutely clear in our communication about these matter i think the green paper be clear the accessible version of the green paper will all be publish by the beginning of next month and we will then have a week consultation period as a result of those version include the easy read version be available i hope that everybody will be able to see clearly what be propose and will be able to respond to the consultation with their view 
 the analogy of the chief secretary to the treasury have prove to be controversial but the minister agree with the point he be make do he not 
 i do not hear what my right hon friend say what i can say be that a very large number of people be dependent on the personal independence payment we want it to be a sustainable benefit that will be there for the long term because of the change we be make which will reduce the future increase in spending on personal independence payment we can be confident and recipient can be confident that that will be the case 
 i be potentially of the few member of this house who have be a recipient of the high rate of live allowance i be a recipient of the high rate of mobility allowance and i rely on a motability car for many year too on the flipside i remember after my hip replacement in my early 30 have to try to navigate the access to work scheme which be pretty impossible in fact it lock people out of work rather than let they in 
 there be many good thing in the green paper that have be bring forward that address some of those point when i think back to what i have to go through from age to i be also pleased that those benefit will be protect for people in that situation pip be also what we call a passporting benefit such thing as access to the blue badge scheme and carer ’s allowance be often dependent on pip so potential implication be that people could be lock out will the minister consider carry these thing forward and meet i to discuss access to the blue badge scheme and carer ’s allowance for people who might lose pip but would still be entitle to those benefit 
 i very much welcome my hon friend ’s testimony to the value of the support that the system provide and the importance of maintain that into the future he be right about passporte benefit the availability of blue badge be not affect by anything in the green paper because the mobility component of personal independence payment be not change by any of the proposal we have make access to carer ’s allowance as we have say certainly will be and i would welcome a discussion with he about that 
 i declare an interest as an honorary vice president of carers uk and i sit on the board of the fife carers centre last september i have the adjournment debate on support   for unpaid carer in that the minister for care   the hon member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock promise that we would 
 forge ahead together with the promise of that future in which unpaid carer be visible value and support ”—[official report   september vol c. 
 that be not how unpaid carer be feel today the minister refer to how the earning limit for carer ’s allowance have increase but there be still a cliff edge be the government planning to bring forward plan to link the earning limit to the hour of employment at the national minimum wage we know that those be some of the thing that cause the overpayment for carer ’s allowance in the place 
 yes the earning threshold will in future be set at time the hourly rate of the national living wage and that will continue indefinitely in addition the chancellor announce in the budget last year that we will look at the idea of an income taper in carer ’s allowance to replace the cliff edge which as the hon member rightly say be a feature of it at the moment we be look at that assessment 
 i thank my right hon friend for how he be respond to this urgent question the conservatives after year in government break our social security system and create a hostile environment for disabled people and therefore it be for we labour in government to fix our social security system i would like to press my right hon friend on this of disabled people already live in poverty and the propose change to personal independence payment could see more be push far into poverty and many be push out of work indeed the government ’s impact assessment highlight that people could lose carer ’s allowance or the carer ’s element may i press he again to think about how we ensure that we support ill and disabled people as we fix the mess that the tories have create 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to say that we be leave with a broken system may i pay tribute to she for her work on the all party parliamentary group on eye health and visual impairment which focus on support people into employment that be the crucial element of this package we will invest substantial sum rise to £ a year by the end of the parliament in support people who be out of work on health and disability ground into work and i very much look forward to work with she in that endeavour when somebody who be out of work move into a job the likelihood of their be below the poverty line be halve so there will be a very positive poverty impact from that commitment 
 i have already be contact by carer in my constituency who be scared about what will happen to they and the people they care for i welcome the minister ’s explanation thus far but there will clearly be a problem with encourage people who care for other to go out to work who will say who ’ go to care for the person i care for now what message do the minister have for those who look after very vulnerable people and can not leave they alone and who can not work 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for make that point give his description of the people be care for they will continue to receive personal independence payment once the change have take effect from november next year those who do not score at least point on any of the daily living activity that the benefit condition set out will not be eligible for personal independence payment i would need to look at the particular case that the hon gentleman have in mind but i imagine that people who can not be leave alone at home will continue to score at least point therefore the carer ’s allowance for their carer will continue as at present 
 i have the high respect for my right hon friend but i be afraid he be not right on this policy as a former physiotherapist i know that many people will not be able to claim carer ’s allowance now that we have have the impact assessment we have see that nearly disabled people will be push far into poverty include child and that carer will lose the lifeline of carer ’s allowance we do not have a social care system to replace it besides social care be more expensive today i want to speak truth to power sometimes government get thing wrong and i ask the government to seriously reflect on these policy the half of pathway to work be good but the half will let a lot of people down please reflect and please withdraw this policy 
 i be grateful to my hon friend but we will not withdraw the policy we will certainly reflect on it and we will consult properly on the content of the green paper the figure publish by the office for budget responsibility yesterday show that the benefit change on their own will take people include adult below the poverty line but that be before any consideration of the impact of the big commitment that we be make to employment support up to £ a year by the end of the parliament that will clearly have a very positive effect in reduce poverty the office for budget responsibility will look at all of this over the summer and then update its figure in the autumn we will see what it conclude but i think the balance of this package will be very positive for reduce poverty in the uk 
 to help family the last government put in place the household support fund which this government have continue however it be due to run out in when the minister ’s change be come in what hope be there for household who need emergency support if the household support fund will be drop when his change come in 
 we have retain the household support fund as the hon member rightly point out and the future arrangement will be set out in due course however i can reassure he of the absolute commitment of this government to support family who need our support the child poverty taskforce be work on this issue at the moment and will bring forward a strategy to address the problem of child poverty the figure publish this morning on household   below average income show just what a huge challenge there be give the very high level of child poverty leave by the previous government we will be address that 
 i thank the minister for pay tribute to carer for the economic and social contribution they make and for the big ever increase in the employment earning threshold for carer there be a lot of worry about the change so could the minister confirm that nobody on pip will be impact by they until november at the early in the meantime i will be work with disabled group in my constituency to understand the impact on individual and the impact of the investment on support disabled people into work the minister speak about transitional arrangement how can i ensure that the view of disabled people in newcastle upon tyne central and west feed into decision about the implementation of these change 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to underline again the hugely important contribution not least economic contribution make by carer the consultation be under way and it will run for a full week from the time when all the accessible version of the green papers be publish which will be in early april i would be very grateful if she encourage the organisation that she be work with to respond to that consultation and i would also be very interested to hear and see her response to it we will take those contribution extremely seriously as we finalise the detail of these proposal 
 before i put my question to the minister i be sure that the house will want to join i in offer condolence to keith brown our deputy party leader on the death of his wife christina mckelvie who be a very distinguished and long serve member of the scottish parliament and a minister 
 the impact assessment sneak out yesterday under cover of the spring statement confirm what the snp have be warn about for some time labour ’s austerity cut will have a devastating effect with the poor and most vulnerable in society force to foot the bill for the chancellor ’s incompetence some people will be affect by the change to carer ’s allowance but also at an absolute minimum—250,000 people include child will be force into poverty these be very modest assessment i hear   the hon member for york central rachael maskell   give a figure of people labour promise that it would improve living standard but with the full extent of the damage now spell out do labour ’s promise not lie in tatter what will it take for the government to change course before irreversible harm be do 
 i echo the hon gentleman ’s condolence the figure be certainly not snuck out yesterday i do not think anyone can accuse the office for budget responsibility of sneak they out they be publish on the day of the spring statement as they always be and always have to be let i make it clear that spend on the personal independence payment will continue to increase above inflation it will not increase as fast as it would have do if we have do nothing but the advantage be that the funding for that   benefit will be sustainable and that be vital because so many people depend on it it be not go to be mean test and it be not go to be frozen it will be there for the long term 
 there be real fear among many of my calder valley constituent with disability and with caring responsibility about the propose change to pip and that fear have be exacerbate by some of the reporting can the minister please give i a categorical assurance that the consultation on these measure be genuine and that the government will ensure that the response of disabled people and of disability right campaign such as scope will be give the weight they deserve 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise those point i can give he the assurance that he seek indeed i speak to scope yesterday and to other disability charity yes this will be a proper consultation and we will listen very carefully to what people say to we in response 
 terminal illness devastate people ’s finance more than terminally ill people every month be refuse pip and every day people die in poverty have fall through the crack of our benefit system many family carer in the midst of bereavement be then leave with nothing the government ’s plan in the green paper say nothing about how the terminally ill or their carer will be affect by these cut can the minister guarantee today that they will not be plunge into deep poverty 
 i be grateful to the hon member for raise that point but the green paper be very clear about the protection provide for people who be terminally ill there be special rule in place and they will absolutely be maintain she can be very much reassure about what the green paper say about that group if there be a point that i have miss that she have spot i would be grateful to hear about it but we have very robust protection for those people for exactly the reason she set out 
 i grow up care for disabled parent as i say in my maiden speech i would not be here if it be not for the sacrifice they make when they have so little in the place i have see both my mother and my father force out of work by their poor health i have see their mental health suffer because they could not get a foot in the door of the nhs i have see the consequence in our family home they suffer significant bout of depression i know the dignity and importance of work to people who want to and can work when my parent health get bad they could not work so i know the importance of protection for people like they i be pleased that the government be emphasise both part of the issue will the minister please assure my constituent who be concerned because of the leak into which an official inquiry be under way that the government be truly listen to our constituent will he give the assurance that through the pathway to work consultation the government want to hear from disability group in my constituency include the cambian   wing college whose representative i meet on monday and other organisation will he also reassure the public that the government be commit to close the disability employability gap we need employer to support people into work too 
 i understand that this be a very important urgent question that be why it be grant but i need to try to get everybody in that be what i be bother about if we can speed up question and answer that would help we all 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for bring his experience to this debate i can absolutely give he the reassurance he seek 
 early in the week i write to the secretary of state ask she to confirm that the plan would not go ahead if the proposal be assess as be harmful to disabled people the equality analysis say that the family who will lose out be estimate to represent of all family who report have someone with a disability in the household give that pip be not relate to work and that the money can not be make up through work change do the minister agree that proceeding be not acceptable when there be this level of harm 
 the assessment publish yesterday be that of those receive the daily live pip component will continue to receive that benefit after the change take effect so i think the concern that the hon lady raise be not entirely appropriate 
 like thousand of other i carry out my caring responsibility this morning before i come to this place i have hand experience of worry about pay the bill every month due to care responsibility something i no long have to worry about will the minister consider whether we need a plan across government departments to identify the support available to ensure that carer can work and that they and their loved one do not fall into poverty as a result of the announcement make 
 i be work with the minister for care in the department of health and social care on this i agree with my hon friend that we need to work across government on these issue we need to be concern about the effect on young carer in the education system so the department for education need to be involve as well his point about cross government work be absolutely right
