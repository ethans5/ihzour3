certainly we will come into the detail of how this work once it be on the statute book in the guidance that be issue but i be make it very clear to the house tonight that the government wish those few people the very small number of asylum seeker and refugee who have be convict of serious sexual offence such that they have be put on the sex offender register to be deny refugee status we will also deny refugee status where we be able to show that an individual have be convict in a foreign court for a crime that would have fall under schedule to the act if they have be convict in the uk those convict and make subject to the notification requirement have commit the most serious of sexual offence which should be include in the definition of a particularly serious crime 
 i shall move on to the amendment relate to the immigration services commissioner the government be seek new power for the immigration advice authority to clamp down on malpractice in the provision of immigration advice build on clause and schedule these new measure will extend the power of the immigration services commissioner to ensure effective modern regulation and enforcement of immigration advice and service 
 government amendment create the power to amend the definition of relevant matter for the different type of immigration advice that can be bring in and out of the immigration services commissioner ’s regulatory oversight it will introduce great flexibility to keep pace with wide modernisation and transformation of the immigration system currently those definition be in primary legislation but this amendment move they into secondary legislation 
 government amendment allow for a person ’s registration as a provider of immigration advice or immigration service to be cancel or suspend with   immediate effect where serious concern be raise regard their action or behaviour government amendment establish that person who have receive certain severe disciplinary sanction can not continue to provide immigration advice under the supervision of a person regulate by the immigration and asylum act otherwise know as substitution

 no 
 for i border security sit alongside fix pothole tackle graffiti and fly tipping and stop e scooter and e bike speeding it be obviously more complicated for thing it involve a great deal of international negotiation but border security be security it be vital for people ’s safety and pride it underpin so much if people can not rely on the basic they can not begin to enjoy everything else that life have to offer if people can not see pledge be keep promise be deliver and thing be improve where they live they will not just lose trust they will succumb to hopelessness we must not allow the spirit of our people to break we must get the basic right and with the bill we will do that 
 we will secure our border with this bill and these amendment we will have new power on seize electronic device a new law to protect life at sea a new statutory border security command tough action on foreign national sex offender and the ending of asylum hotel that cost eye watering sum it be in our national interest to get our border back under control against criminal smuggler gang 
 in order to understand the politic of where we be i have be look back at old debate and conservative members may enjoy hear what i be about to say with our policy and politic on border security as with much else i feel that we could benefit from listen to a question that be put by the earl of stockton in his maiden speech in the other place in he say 
 should we just slowly and majestically sink like a great ship or shall we make a new determined and united effort let we do the latter and then historian of the future will not describe the decline and fall of britain but the beginning of a new and glorious renaissance ”—[official report house of lords   january vol c. 
 as the member of parliament for bournemouth east i want to work with all in this place who share the former conservative prime minister ’s moderation and   determination to have a united effort to bring about a well britain that involve fix the basic such as border security after all it would be an absurdity for small boat to sink a big ship 
 that be an important concern as my hon friend know we be determined to open up opportunity for people who have be out of work   often for a long time on health and disability ground and to give they the chance to get into work through much well employment support however we recognise that there will be people who will never be able to work under the proposal for claim for the new universal credit health element from next april a high payment will protect those with the most severe lifelong condition that have no prospect of improvement and who will never be able to work eligibility for that will be through the work capability assessment condition criterion 
 i refer the house to my declaration in the register of members financial interests about the help that i receive from the refugee asylum and migration policy project i be also the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on migration i welcome the government ’s action in the bill to repeal part of the previous government ’s repeat gimmick and nonsense legislation in the last parliament i will speak to new clause and all of which i have sponsor 
 new clause be table by my right hon friend apology i should have say my hon friend   the member for nottingham east nadia whittome she be not right honourable but she should be the new clause would require the home office to publish quarterly statistic and information on death in the asylum system and small boat channel crossing under the last government a horrifying number of refugee and people seek asylum die try to cross the channel and in home office accommodation in that number reach a record high despite daily and weekly report on the number of people stop or deport we still do not have regular clear and transparent reporting on those who have lose their life in the system that be incredibly important not just morally but in order to address the evidence gap so that we get policy right 
 new clause would require report on the right to work i hear what the minister say about this be a discussion about time but mental health and working right be not separate issue the majority of asylum seeker in the uk be unable to work and use their skill to support themselves and their family or even to save enough to rent a home instead they be trap isolated inactive and dependent on state support there be countless compelling reason why asylum seeker should be allow to work like the rest of the population give the huge amount of support that idea have from the public and business we should at least have the opportunity to scrutinise why the ban remain and the impact that it be have if we want integration why not let people work in their community and build english language skill 
 finally new clause table by my hon friend   the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy seek to ensure that child bear in the uk who have grow up here and know no other home be not price out of citizenship simply because of their parent immigration status at the time of their birth such young people be part of our community school and the fabric of our future they should not be deny their right or go on to face barrier in education housing healthcare and across society they be not stranger they be our friend and neighbour 
 some have stoke racist division against migrant a drum that the far right have continually bang since and the whole house must oppose that rhetoric amid rise anti refugee sentiment include last year ’s shocking riot it could not be more urgent or valuable to enable people to feel secure and contribute to their community i be aghast at some of the amendment table by opposition party particularly new clause i wonder how many ruin live those member will consider too many it be shameful to see the victimisation of people who have come here to find safety 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to support disabled people in receipt of personal independence payment 
 personal independence payment be a crucial benefit that make a contribution towards the extra cost of live with a disability i know how anxious many people be when there be talk about reform but this government want to ensure that pip be there for people who need it now and into the future in our green paper we promise to review the pip assessment work with disabled people the organisation that represent they and other expert and we be start the phase of that review today my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability will be invite in stakeholder this week to develop the scope and term of reference of this review and will keep the house update as this work progress 
 many of the disabled people in bradford who rely on pip to live with dignity and stability be rightly horrify by these propose cut in particular the point rule have the potential to devastate the life of ten of thousand of people in bradford overnight let we be clear these plan would take away a vital lifeline from those with the great need live in the most deprived area of britain i can not support any cut that worsen inequality in place such as bradford so i say to the minister in absolute sincerity please listen to the grow call in this place and out there to scrap these unfair cut and instead do the right thing by tax the super rich so that they can pay their fair share 
 i hear very clearly what my hon friend say but i also want to be clear to the house if people can never work we want to protect they if people can work we want to support they the truth be that a disabled person who be in work be half as likely to be poor as who be out of work we want to improve people ’s chance and choice by support those who can work to do so and by protect those who can not 
 the personal independence payment do what it say on the tin it be design to enable people to live an independent life as someone who have represent constituent in tribunal appeal i know only too well that while there be many who should not be claim pip there be also many whose disability may not be immediately apparent will the minister assure i that she will use the utmost care and sensitivity before take any further decision 
 i can absolutely reassure the right hon gentleman that we will make these change carefully we be consult with disabled people and the organisation that represent they about what support can be available for anyone who lose out we will be consult with disabled people about how to build our £ a year employment support programme and we will make sure that those who can never work will be protect include by make sure that they do not have to go through reassessment repeatedly which have be the situation so far 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s confirmation that there will be a full review of pip in consultation with disabled people and their organisation pip be design year ago but since then we have increase our understanding of the impact that fluctuate condition and mental health problem can have on disabled people ’s ability to live independently do the secretary of state agree that it be certainly past time for a review of the pip system to ensure that mental health problem be fully understand and that the fluctuate nature of some condition be properly take into account 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be more than a decade since pip be introduce and there have be change in the prevalence of disability in the nature of long term condition in wide society and in the workplace too we have also see a real increase in recent year in the number of young people and those with mental health condition so it be right that we now have a review of the pip assessment process this be a highly sensitive issue and it will take time but my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability and i will be do this in consultation with disabled people and the organisation that represent they and we will begin invite they in from this week i also very much hope that all member of parliament can feed into this process include with the organisation in their own constituency 
 the secretary of state will be aware of our concern around the change and the damage they could do to the most vulnerable she will also be aware of the implication for the scottish government who administer this will she at least give i the assurance that the full detail about how the change will interact with devolve power will come before a vote be bring to this chamber 
 my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability be work closely with all the devolve administration to ensure that the change work in every part of the country i also say to opposition members that we want to ensure that disabled people in scotland have the same right chance and choice to get into work stay in work and get on in their work so i hope the hon member will be keen to work with we on those issue too 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in my constituency more than people be set to lose the lifeline that be pip when we look at other element of the green paper family across the country be set to lose out often those who benefit from pip be from the most deprived community in the united kingdom and those be set to be hit hard will the secretary of state advise how the government be consider the economic impact of the cut on these community with high level of deprivation 
 the hon gentleman ’s figure be the number of people right now who may have few than point on pip these change be not come in overnight they would not be implement until november next year and many people ’s health condition change   so it be not right to say that that be the exact number who would lose out we want to ensure that anyone who do lose out have their eligible care and health need meet as well as have the employment support they need we know that many disabled people want to work they have too often be deny opportunity to get into work and this government want to change that 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in makerfield constituency 
 it be an unacceptable part of the conservative legacy that almost young people be out of work or education and have little hope of a good start in life that be why as part of the plan to get britain work we will create a guarantee for all young people age to in england to ensure they have access to high quality training or an apprenticeship or have help to find work that plan will be vital to young people everywhere include in makerfield ’s town 
 in the town i represent the large type of private employment be the trade bricklayer plumber electrician these be the people who build our nation ’s future and on whom our future security and prosperity depend they be the work people the labour party be create to represent what be the minister do to ensure that more young people get into the trade in particular partnering with local technical college like our in wigan and leigh 
 i thank my hon friend for that question because as the prime minister say we be the party of the builder as my hon friend say the labour party be create to serve the simple principle that working class people could run the country the department for education be work closely with college and with we in the department for work and pensions to create construction foundation apprenticeship from this august which will give many more young people the tool they need for a career in the trade that be in addition to dwp support for employer which we have recently expand specifically with those trade he mention in mind 
 the rule and regulation that apply to employment education or training in the makerfield constituency should apply across this great united kingdom many of those in the construction sector that the minister refer to whether they be builder carpenter plumber plasterer or electrician come from my constituency of strangford across to london so it be important that people in my constituency and across northern ireland get the same opportunity through the college will the minister ensure that discussion take place with northern ireland so that my constituency can continue to supply the people who build house here in london 
 i pay tribute to all those from the hon gentleman ’s constituency who have be part of build our whole country we work very closely with   the devolved administrations across the united kingdom to ensure that as the secretary of state lay out chance and opportunity be there for everybody i look forward to work with the hon gentleman as we move forward through our change programme 
 what step she be take to help support young people not in education employment or training 
 our new change jobcentre will serve the whole of great britain the change that we be bring forward will mean more personalised help for everyone but especially young people frontline work coach who help young people need well technology and more time to help they find the good opportunity the goal of our change be to well serve employer and young people 
 in the pandemic young people be among the least at risk but they give up so much of their life to protect those who be at risk no generation have make such a sacrifice for another since the war but they have be badly let down across the uk in be not in employment education or training and it be bad in scotland where the figure be in young scot what step be the minister take to mitigate the inaction of the snp scottish government and build a well future for young scot 
 as i just mention our new jobcentre will create a universal service across great britain we must make those change to serve young people my hon friend make an excellent point about the pandemic generation who deserve much well from we all i know that his city of edinburgh be full of chance and opportunity that we can not let go to waste give the role of edinburgh and glasgow in our visitor economy i be sure that he will be interested in the work we be do with ukhospitality to help more young people to have an opportunity in that great sector 
 struggle to make end meet pay bill buy work appropriate clothing and pay for public transport all affect someone ’s ability to get and keep a job that be just as true for under-25s as it be for anybody else but the government continue to maintain a low rate of universal credit for young people when there be no guarantee that they have financial support from their family in look at universal credit will the government consider that 
 as the hon member will know we be review universal credit i be particularly focused on ensure that young people have a chance before they reach the age of if they be out of work in those year after leave school or college it be absolutely devastating for the rest of their career that be why we be make these change 
 over the weekend i be shocked but not surprised to see the new statistic for young people in thanet who be not in education employment or training have hit the figure be the high in the south east some of young people in thanet also experience support for special educational need although i be not suggest that correlation equal causation can the minister explain how deny access to the health relate element of universal credit will help those young people into work 
 the house will know that we have consultation in a number of policy area relate to my hon friend ’s question as i have say in the end young people need an opportunity at the start in place like thanet where there be significant poverty and challenge but great opportunity i want to ensure that we serve employer and the young people who need they much well 
 employer in my constituency tell i that they be less likely to employ young people as a result of the employment rights bill because of the increase risk of employ someone at the start of their career what representation have the minister make to her colleague to ensure that the most damaging part of that legislation be soften 
 the house may know that on come into office the secretary of state and i totally change the way the department for work and pensions approach employer we want to serve they much well and we have give they a single point of contact have meet many business over the past or month my experience have be that they have vacancy and want we to help fill they we will do that so that we can serve employer and young people alike 
 what step her department be take to help increase the accuracy of personal independence payment assessment 
 the department be commit to ensure that individual receive high quality and accurate assessment assessment supplier be closely monitor use a range of performance measure design to improve the accuracy of their advice independent audits be conduct to maintain high standard and as part of our pathway to work proposal we be consider record assessment as standard to increase transparency and build trust in the system 
 datum share with i by dermot devlin from disabled people against cuts show that £ have be spend on pip appeal in the past year alone and also that his majesty ’s courts and tribunals service have report that over of those pip appeal have be successful when people be put through the harrowing process of be tell that their pip appeal be not appropriate and have to go through the entire appeal system what be minister do to ensure that any change make that system friendly to those use it 
 i would be very happy to have a conversation with the hon gentleman about the assessment process and the mandatory reconsideration process but i would also say to he that i do not recognise those statistic indeed under the current statistic appeal be down by on the previous year to january the other point that i would make to he be that while around of application be subject to a mandatory reconsideration only around of those be successful 
 the centre for inclusive living in dudley which support those with disability and many resident have write to i to raise concern about the pip entitlement criterion and assessment what reassurance can my hon friend give that this government will protect those most vulnerable in society and that those with disability will be enable not disable 
 i thank my hon friend for raise her constituent concern and say to they that as my right hon friend the secretary of state say at the beginning of this session we have this week announce a broad review of the pip assessment process that i hope in due course and by work with stakeholder will be able to give my hon friend ’s constituent and stakeholder organisation considerable reassurance 
 can the minister explain why it appear that telephone assessment for pip have a significantly high success rate in application than face to face application 
 i be not able to explain the reason for that difference but i be able to reassure the right hon gentleman that we be look to move away from telephone appointment and return as quickly as possible to assessment make face to face wherever we be able to do so 
 can the minister give we more information on what the pip assessment review will look like 
 as my hon friend will appreciate the review have only be announce today there be a considerable number of strand to it that will be lead by my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability what i can tell my hon friend be that as my right hon friend the secretary of state say early that work be begin this week by reach out as be entirely appropriate to those stakeholder organisation who will feed in to the purpose and scope of that work move forward 
 what progress her department have make on its review of the personal independence payment assessment system 
 as i say in response to an early question it be over a decade since pip be introduce and there have be significant shift in the nature of disability and long term condition in this country as well as change in wide society and the workplace that be why our green paper announce our plan to review the pip assessment work with disabled people the organisation   that represent they and other we be start that work today invite key organisation represent disabled people in to discuss the term of reference which we will publish and we will continue to keep the house update as our work progress 
 there have rightly be a lot of focus on the people the government ’s own impact assessment say will be push into poverty by this cruel disability benefit cut but the true impact on poverty will be even bad new dwp figure obtain from a freedom of information request show that family already in poverty will be hit even hard it be wrong that that have have to come out through a freedom of information request so will the minister come clean today about the true scale of poverty that this disastrous policy will cause do it not fly in the face of what a labour government be mean to do lift people out of poverty not push they far into poverty 
 my hon friend will know as we have be very clear with the house that those figure do not take into consideration the number of disabled people who we believe will find work through our big ever investment in employment support pathway to work neither do they take into consideration the huge stride we will make with our forthcoming child poverty strategy we have be more open and transparent than any previous government publish all the poverty impact and other detailed assessment because we be very happy to have this debate in the house and to put forward our case our mission be to get as many people as we can into work and on in their career with more income and well choice and chance that be what a labour government be for 
 my consistent louisa write to i about her pip assessment she suffer from a number of debilitate fluctuate condition her assessment take over hour and the assessor ignore her explanation do not ask how she feel afterwards and threaten to end the call when her word be misinterpret which go against dwp guidance will the secretary of state undertake to review how fluctuating and invisible condition be handle in the assessment process 
 yes and i would really like the hon lady to send in that information and we will go through it with a fine toothed comb 
 i would be interested to hear from the secretary of state about what assessment she have make of the impact on public service particularly adult social care of the move to change personal independence payment in my local authority the director have say to i that she be deeply concerned about the additional cost and about move people into dependency as their independence be remove can the secretary of state set out what assessment have be make and provide figure to demonstrate that 
 our objective be to give disabled people more independence by ensure that those who can work have the support to do so we have clear evidence that be in work be good for people ’s health good work be good for people ’s physical and mental health   we be invest extra money into social care include an additional £ this year on top of the £ extra for the nhs i would be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss these issue far as i know she be passionate about ensure that people have the help care and support that they need and deserve 
 last wednesday the prime minister tell i that cut back on pip eligibility be in line with post war labour principle but more and more labour members be say that that policy balance the government ’s book on the back of disabled people and those who care for they be cruel and wrong in principle will the secretary of state tell we who be right 
 i do not recognise the way the hon lady frame the prime minister ’s answer we want a social security system that protect those who can never and will never work but disabled people who be out of work and economically inactive be more likely than non disabled people to say they want to work and if they be in work they be half as likely to be poor we want to shift the focus of the system to do more to help people who can work to do so and to protect those who can not because that be the way that we give people a well future 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in kensington and bayswater constituency 
 as we have already discuss every young person in this country need a good start as part of our plan to get britain work we announce £ worth of funding for youth guarantee trailblazer to lead the way kensington and bayswater be cover by the youth guarantee trailblazer launch last month by the greater london authority 
 i recently visit the north kensington jobcentre to learn about its support for young people and discuss the potential for work more closely with our brilliant local college the north kensington centre for skills so that people can access opportunity in industry such as trade and housing will the minister outline what more the department be do to bring together college and jobcentre for young people 
 i thank my hon friend both for his question and for go to see the team at the north kensington jobcentre there be a really dedicated team of work coach specifically for young people i be work with colleague in the department for education on the development of skills england so that in the future our work coach for example the who serve his constituency and look after young people will have much close access to get they into course and get they build to move our economy and their career on 
 the government ’s own impact assessment of their employment rights bill say that it will increase the cost to business by £ which will be bear mostly by small business do the minister share my concern that when combine with the additional national insurance charge on employer that will reduce the opportunity for young people in my constituency just as much as for young people in kensington and bayswater 
 i have say already in this session of question that we have change the dwp to serve employer much well and that be an important shift i understand that conservative members do not want people in this country to have great right at work sick pay if they need it or secure hour if they be on an exploitative hour contract unfortunately for they last year the public vote for the opposite 
 what step she plan to take to encourage young people to increase their private pension pot 
 this be an important question and where we have see some good news on the back of cross party work over the last year automatic enrolment have succeed in transform participation rate in workplace pension particularly for young people participation among all eligible to year old have increase from to but there be much more to do that be why the phase of our pension review will look at further step to improve pension outcome for everyone include those lucky enough to be young 
 i thank the minister for that response thank to the introduction of auto enrolment million of young people be now save for their retirement but i have hear worrying report in mid bedfordshire that increase in employer national insurance which have result in pay freeze be now cause people to decide to opt out of pension saving do the minister recognise that risk to pension adequacy if so what be he do to address it 
 less than of saver actively opt out of save each month but the hon gentleman be completely right to say that we need to remain vigilant and ensure that opt out rate do not rise in the year ahead there be some more volatility in opt out rate during the pandemic for reason that i be sure he will understand but as i say we have be see those come down recently i be happy to keep talk to he about that in the year ahead 
 if we want young people include those in my constituency to believe in the value of long term investing they need to see that their pension be help to build the country that they live in and be not just distant market will the minister set out what step he be take to ensure that the government ’s pension reform encourage fund to invest more in uk infrastructure and hybrid company 
 my hon friend raise an important point although we celebrate the success of auto enrolment as   the hon member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson   have just do we must complete the job we need big and well pension fund that be well able to deliver return for their member support our economy and invest in infrastructure and private asset in the month and year ahead 
 what estimate her department have make of the potential impact of change to the eligibility criterion for personal independence payment on the number of people receive that payment who will move into employment 
 pathway to work set out reform to stop people fall into inactivity they include tailor employment support for people out of work on health and disability ground include those claim personal independence payment so that they can fulfil their ambition like everybody else 
 the government say that their pip reform will help people into employment but the multiple sclerosis society say that of sufferer believe those reform will make it hard for they to find work not easy an estimate must have be make of what percentage of claimant will feasibly enter employment as a result of these reform will the minister share those figure 
 this be a very important set of reform for exactly that reason to make sure people do have the opportunity to move into work in working age pip claimant be in work in march last year we want many more to have that opportunity we be go to improve employment support substantially connect to work be be roll out across the country this year and there will be an additional £ per year for employment support by the end of the parliament as the hon gentleman know the impact of these change will be set out by the office for budget responsibility at the time of the autumn budget and there will be very big improvement for those who be intend to benefit from they 
 help those who can work to find meaningful employment be an important way to tackle poverty among disabled people but it will require investment in employment support programme incentive for employer to recruit disabled people and enforcement of anti discrimination rule give the importance of these measure be it not appropriate that member be ask to vote on any change to the benefit system only after all the information about the impact of the proposal have be provide 
 my hon friend be right about the scale of the ambition and the change that need to be make to deliver on it sir charlie mayfield be lead the keep britain working review at the moment look at what more employer can contribute to those goal we have commit an extra £ a year for employment support but we need to get on with the change we have   announce in order to ensure that the cost of pip in particular be sustainable in the future as it be very important they should be 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be week since the government cobble together an emergency plan for welfare cut to rescue the chancellor from the consequence of her job destroy economy shrink budget but we be still wait for some information can the minister tell the house how many more people will be in work as a result of these measure 
 as i have just tell the house the office for budget responsibility will publish its assessment in the autumn that be what we say at the time of the spring statement this be a very big programme the commitment of an additional £ a year to employment support will open up opportunity for a very large number of people in the way that the new deal for disabled people do under the last labour government all those year ago we want to get back to provide the support that people need at the moment people who be out of work on health and disability ground say that they could be in work today if they have the support they need we be committed to deliver that support 
 i look forward to the obr ’s report and also to its assessment of the impact of the employment rights bill we know that many ten of thousand of job be go to be lose because of the national insurance rise and we know from the obr that because of the change that the government have introduce and the scrapping of the measure we be introduce few people will be in work and almost half a more will be on long term sickness benefit 
 however let i ask the minister about disability benefit be he aware that half the number of people who receive pip who have multiple sclerosis will no long be eligible for that benefit under the plan that the government be bring forward a quarter of people with cerebral palsy and quarter of people with arthritis will also be ineligible be the minister happy with that and if not what hope can he give the hundred of thousand of people who be be abandon that the government will look after they 
 the hon gentleman be completely mistaken these change will not take effect until november next year and follow each claimant ’s award review after that date who receive the benefit will depend on the outcome of the assessment at that time as the hon gentleman will know the view of the office for budget responsibility be that about of those who be currently claim pip will lose their benefit as a result of these change a much low proportion than the he have just refer to 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in colne valley constituency 
 in colne valley my hon friend ’s constituent receive support from huddersfield jobcentre work be also ongoing lead by west yorkshire combine authority which be of our trailblazer it be step up to help everybody who need help get into work whether or not they be on universal credit 
 recently kirklees college in partnership with flannery plant hire and kirklees council officially launch the kirklees operator skill hub to meet local skill demand in the construction industry the hub which be the of its kind in the country be a mobile unit with virtual reality plant machinery simulator and classroom facility for skill bootcamp and will open many door for young people in my constituency do the minister agree that such initiative will help many young people into work and help we to bring about the growth that we need in our economy 
 i do agree with my hon friend as we have say in response to a number of question our ministerial team know that this government be about build the home that we need and ensure that the job in the sector go to people who will really benefit from a career in construction and i congratulate kirklees college and all those involve in that pioneer work last week i visit the uk construction week conference where george clarke talk about the fantastic opportunity in construction and the great building business i say well do to everyone in my hon friend ’s constituency who be push this forward 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of mean test the winter fuel payment on level of pensioner poverty 
 i refer the right hon member to the secretary of state ’s letter of   november   to the work and pensions committee as well as mean test the winter fuel payment this government launch the big ever pension credit take up campaign because we want all pensioner to receive the support to which they be entitle the result have be almost more award than be receive during the same period in the precede year 
 the government do indeed launch a campaign to increase the number of pension credit application but sadly there be also a surge an increase of 133%—in the number of claim that be not allow and more than award be not make for many pensioner include a number in my constituency the winter fuel payment be a lifeline indeed many need their heating to be turn on throughout the year not just during the winter but just because of an arbitrary threshold they now receive nothing at all and they be lose out will the government look at this again give the impact and the risk of push more pensioner into poverty 
 i can tell the right hon member about pensioner poverty it halve under the last labour government and it rise on the conservatives watch by yes we have have to make some difficult choice but it be because of those difficult choice that we can   afford a £ annual increase in the state pension over the current parliament and an extra £ a year for the nhs none of those choice would the conservatives back which be why the nhs and the state pension would be endanger on their watch 
 in my year as a member of parliament i have run consistent campaign throughout my constituency to raise awareness of pension credit and encourage hundred of people to sign up to it but i know that many of my constituent be just above the threshold and by no mean well off what assessment will the government make of those who be not eligible for pension credit but will still face fuel poverty next winter 
 i be grateful for the work that have be do by council and sector organisation throughout the united kingdom to drive uptake of pension credit that work have lead to the extra award that i mention early the choice we have make mean that we can protect pensioner across the board and the increase in the state pension in april be possible exactly because of the tough choice that we have have to make 
 stockport council be of the local authority to roll out the warm space programme that be use by sector group to support people in need during the winter month will the government commit themselves to help authority roll such programme out early in the face of the winter fuel cut and rise energy price 
 i be grateful for the work of local authority include mine in swansea to provide place for pensioner and in fact member of all age group to go to if they be in need during the winter the most important action we can take be tackle directly the cause of the issue that the hon gentleman have raise by bring down energy bill in the year ahead move away from the system that the conservatives leave we which be dependent on the price of gas drive by the action of dictator such as putin and continue to raise the state pension fast than inflation over the current parliament which be why the new state pension be set to increase by £ by the end of this parliament 
 this morning the work and pensions committee be at the welsh assembly where we hear from wales ’s older people ’s commissioner as part of our pensioner poverty review i be impressed that wales have a role with real legal clout from what we hear it be make a difference for old people in wales do minister agree that we should at least look at extend that to england and scotland 
 we should always learn lesson from wales in fact this government be already do that the roll out of free breakfast club which be happen across england at the moment be pioneer in wales child be receive a free breakfast because of the work do in wales i praise my hon friend and the entire work and pensions committee for the work that it be do as part of its inquiry into pensioner poverty    i will be come to give evidence to the committee shortly and i know that its member have be listen not just in wales but more widely with event in glasgow and manchester as well 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i suspect that the hon member on the government front bench be now surround i suspect that they be the only people leave in this chamber who be prepared to defend the cutting of the winter fuel payment dozen of their own mp have now join a long list of people tell the government that they have get it wrong include the welsh minister talk about learn lesson from wales the money save expert martin lewis and voter up and down this country the conservatives have lead this campaign from the start but if the government will not listen to we will they now listen to everyone else and think again 
 we have set out our policy but here we be month on and i have no idea what the conservatives policy be i be not even sure that they know what their policy be for all the shouting there be no promise to reinstate a universal winter fuel payment there be policy from the leader of the opposition the very woman who call for the winter fuel payment to be mean test in now she want to mean test the entire state pension apparently that be exactly the sort of thing we will look at she think that be bold policymake it be not it be bonker 
 the good news be that the minister have no responsibility for the opposition 
 that be not something that the leader of the opposition say to the point in hand the winter fuel payment i wonder for how much long this tone deaf final stand will go on every time the government talk about winter fuel payment they make out that they have no choice but that be simply not true to govern be to choose at good this policy be only ever go to save £ or so but they be spend £ on set up an energy company and the cost of asylum hotel will rise to £ under labour this have always be a choice and it be the wrong can the minister guarantee that next winter every single of the poor pensioner who miss out on the winter fuel payment this year will receive it 
 i can guarantee that this government be go to deliver on our priority for pensioner by raise the state pension with a £ a year increase this april and save the nhs with a £ increase every single year what will the conservatives be do none of that because they oppose every single measure require to fund it we know what the tory plan be because we have just live through it pensioner poverty rise and the nhs collapsing 
 what step she be take through the social security system to tackle poverty in wales 
 this government be commit to tackle poverty right across the uk we be review universal credit to ensure that it be do the job we want it to do make work pay and tackle poverty we have already announce that we will improve the adequacy of the standard allowance in universal credit and we have introduce the fair repayment rate alongside that the child poverty taskforce be explore all available lever to reduce child poverty in all nation include consider social security reform 
 just a day before the new figure reveal yet another rise in child poverty in wales the uk labour government confirm plan for billion of pound worth of welfare cut push ten of thousand more child into hardship the government tell i that the data be not robust enough to know the poverty impact on wales which be really not good enough the labour minister of the senedd not the assembly if i may correct   the hon member for bristol north east damien egan have also criticise this government ’s approach will the secretary of state now listen to the minister of wales conduct a wales specific impact assessment and scrap these cruel measure 
 i be sorry to disappoint the hon lady but i be sure she would not want we to produce a potentially inaccurate assessment of the impact on wales what i would say and i be sure that she agree with this be that the level of poverty in wales be unacceptable which be a result of year of the conservative party fail to address the long term industrial decline of many community across wales i would also say to she that the good way to get people out of poverty be to get they into work so i be sure she will welcome the recent launch of the inactivity trailblazer in wales 
 do the minister agree with i that the new fair repayment rate which cap universal credit deduction at along with the action of the welsh government to help more than young people gain skill and find job through the young person ’s guarantee scheme will help alleviate poverty in wales and therefore should be welcome 
 i of course agree with my hon friend about both the benefit of the youth guarantee and the specific impact of the fair repayment rate which across the country will support of the poor family include family with child 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 since our last question time work and pensions ministers and local leader have launch of our get britain work trailblazer programme across the uk back by £ of additional investment these include south yorkshire ’s brilliant plan to get people back to health and back to work trailblazer in london include specialist support   for young care leaver and those with musculoskeletal condition join up health and employment support in blaenau gwent denbighshire and neath port talbot in wales and our youth guarantee in cambridgeshire and peterborough there be still much more that we need to do but we have already make real progress in unlock people ’s potential and get britain work and grow again 
 of my constituent be experience severe delay in get access to work scheme payment date back to february in correspondence with the department a letter openly say there be no long term solution to that so when will the secretary of state come forward with a long term solution to speed up these payment 
 i really thank the hon gentleman for his question and we do actually have a plan right now it be announce in our green paper that we be go to reform access to work it be a brilliant support with a grant or money to help people with physical aid and adaptation and other support to get work and to stay in work i would encourage he to input into the review and either i or my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability would be more than happy to meet he to hear his view about how we can make this work for his constituent 
 accord to sense there be over people with complex need in north west cambridgeshire many of whom will never be able to work because of their condition do the minister agree that dignity for severely disabled people need to be a priority for the welfare system and can he update the house on progress towards ensure that people whose condition mean they will never be able to work be no long subject to the appalling repeat reassessment that we see all too often under the previous government 
 my hon friend raise a very important subject social security must always be there for those who can not work the change announce recently to the rate of universal credit protect the income of those with the most severe lifelong condition who will never be able to work we will also guarantee that for both new and existing claim those in this group will not need to be reassess in future those be bake into the green paper proposal 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the number of job vacancy be fall month on month under this labour government but the number of people employ be also fall could the right hon lady admit what this mean be happen in the economy 
 it be quite interesting to get that question from the shadow secretary of state since under her government the employment rate do not get back to where it be pre covid the only country in the g7 not to do so she leave young people not in education employment or training and she leave near record number of people—2.8 out of work due to long term   sickness business be still desperate to recruit we be overhaul the system to ensure that people get the support they need 
 i be disappointed that the secretary of state do not answer the question i can answer it if she will not it mean that business have stop hire the grow economy that we leave be be hammer by the government ’s job tax and thousand of young people be leave school and university with bad prospect than this time last year business need a government who understand they and back they that be what job depend on she need business to hire people so she can hit her employment target what be her message to they 
 the shadow secretary of state fail to recognise that job vacancy be fall under her government i would say to she that we be inundate with business that be desperate to recruit and to get young people the skill they need i meet a whole group of business in leicestershire last week who be really keen to work with we i suggest the hon lady take a good long hard look at her own party ’s record the number of people she leave on the scrapheap say sorry and get her own policy right 
 i have be in touch with a constituent who have a disability and need help with showering and dressing she be concerned that under our propose reform she will not score enough point to continue receive the daily live portion of pip i welcome the secretary of state ’s announcement that the government be review the pip assessment include the descriptor but can she confirm that case like that of my constituent will be consider as part of the review 
 i recognise my hon friend ’s concern we will engage stakeholder to consider the scope of the review before publish term of reference in the review we will consider whether the assessment criterion effectively target the right people at the right level we will look at the descriptor and consider the point allocate to they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 with people set to be plunge into poverty through the proposal in the green paper and family set to go deeply into poverty will the secretary of state advise how change to pip will ensure that people with disability be live their good life 
 the crucial thing be to improve the employment support for people who be out of work on health and disability ground as the hon gentleman know we have an ambitious programme connect to work which be be roll out this calendar year build up to an additional £ a year in employment support by the end of the parliament at the moment there be people out of work on health and disability ground who say they would like to be in a job now and could be in a job now if they have the support they need we be determine through the change to provide exactly that support 
 my constituent charlie vernon be happily benefit from the access to work scheme until redundancy he find a new job and do a fresh application last autumn but since then well beyond the week timeframe there have be nothing will my right hon friend look into these sort of delay and have a more join up system because assessor be apparently deal with application from august at the moment 
 my hon friend be right that there be currently delay with the access to work scheme reflect the very large increase in demand and application for it over the past year or we be make change to speed thing up we be also in the green paper consult on the future of the access to work scheme i would really welcome input from my hon friend and perhaps her constituent as well about the change we should be make 
 the government claim to be the party of business but speak to business today and they be hurt reduced opportunity for wealth creation and entrepreneurship employee national insurance contribution and the employment rights bill be destroy opportunity what be the government do to incentivise our wealth creator and encourage job creation 
 the government be provide the stability that business desperately need we be work to transform skill in this country that be absolutely what most business say to i they be desperately short of we be overhaul our job centre so that we actually serve business need i would just say gently to the hon gentleman that it be under his party that we see the low business investment in the g7 we be go to overhaul that and make this the good country in which to start up and grow a business 
 what assessment have the minister make of the merit of increase local housing allowance to alleviate the pressure on housing authority 
 my hon friend raise an important matter i just point out that the april year local housing allowance increase have cost an additional £ in the last financial year and it will cost about £ over year we keep local housing allowance rate under review he be right to stress the importance of those but future decision on they will need to be base on the government ’s priority and reflect the difficult fiscal condition that the government be deal with 
 help more people off welfare and into work will require the support and good will of employer which i fear those on the government benches do not fully recognise how will the minister achieve that move have clobber business with the job tax which cover all sector of business hospice charity and many employer 
 as i say in response to an early question we be overhaul the way that the department for work and pensions support employer we think it be unacceptable that only in business have ever   use a jobcentre to recruit we be change that include by have a single account manager for business so that they do not have to tell their story time and again we be overhaul skill in this country reform the apprenticeship and extend the number of sector base work academy programme and short skill programme that business desperately want i know that business be desperately keen to engage with we because they want to recruit and it be about time that the right hon lady ’s party start listen to business 
 i have be ask by many of my livingston constituent for reassurance on the government ’s propose welfare change can the secretary of state assure the house that these reform will genuinely help people into decent secure work all the while protect those who clearly can not work due to ill health or disability 
 i absolutely reassure my hon friend that that be what we intend to do our employment bill be about ensure that we improve the quality of job give great security to people and bring about more flexible working that will benefit sick and disabled people we be invest £ in employment support to make sure that disabled people have the chance and choice they deserve through our review lead by sir charlie mayfield we be change the workplace to make it more inclusive because the labour party be absolutely about ensure that disabled people who can work have the right to do so 
 carer uk report that unpaid carer be still receive debt notice over carer ’s allowance between may and february the number of notice increase by so we be now talk about people will the secretary of state halt the creation of those overpayment debt until her independent review have take place and the recommendation be implement 
 the hon gentleman be right that there have be a problem over a long period with overpayment often inadvertent of carer ’s allowance that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state appoint liz sayce to undertake her independent review i know she be make good progress and i have regularly keep in touch with she we be look forward to receive her recommendation which will cover those who have be affect and will recommend change for the future too 
 what analysis have be do of how the change propose in the pathway to work green paper will affect those who rely on pip not just for employment support but for their daily living and mobility need can my right hon friend please assure my constituent in wolverhampton west who be disabled and will never be able to work that their financial support will not be restrict in a way that affect their quality of life so that they can live with independence and the dignity that they deserve 
 that be an important concern as my hon friend know we be determined to open up opportunity for people who have be out of work   often for a long time on health and disability ground and to give they the chance to get into work through much well employment support however we recognise that there will be people who will never be able to work under the proposal for claim for the new universal credit health element from next april a high payment will protect those with the most severe lifelong condition that have no prospect of improvement and who will never be able to work eligibility for that will be through the work capability assessment severe condition criterion 
 how be the minister work with the department for education to ensure that when young people leave education they have the skill they need to thrive in the world of work 
 i refer the hon gentleman to some of the response we have already give the dwp and the dfe be work together closely as we change apprenticeship and change our jobcentre to ensure that the opportunity be there have meet the hon gentleman i know that his constituency be full of opportunity for young people and we want to ensure that they get they 
 recent analysis by health equity north show that more than £ will be strip out of the local economy in the city of durham every year due to pip change that come on top of the already worsen health condition for people in the north east due to tory austerity would it not be more constructive for the government to start by listen to the call of disability group and disabled people and support they into work rather than cut the benefit and push those people far into poverty 
 i can reassure my hon friend that we be listen we be consult precisely on how good to deploy the additional £ a year for employment support that we have commit to in the green paper however the assessment of those measure need to take account of the significant impact that support many more people into work will have on reduce poverty 
 my constituent be extremely concerned about change to the pip assessment system and particularly how they will affect people with mental health issue and fluctuate long term condition those people may not be able to show the require evidence of how their ability to function be impact since their experience do not always fit within the daily living and mobility assessment criterion can the minister assure i that the assessment system will be update to take those genuine challenge into account 
 as i say early we be review the pip assessment process to ensure that it be fit for the future that start this week with stakeholder have be invite in to discuss the scope of the review and its term of reference however it be important to bear in mind that by the end of the parliament we will still be spend £ more on personal independence payment and there will be more people on pip than there be now we be make change to focus pip on those in great need while look at the underlie   assessment process to ensure that it be fit for the future but there will be more spending and more people on pip by the time of the next election 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for what she say about resolve the issue with the application process for access to work will she also kindly reassure disabled people about the future of access to work and that there will not be cut in the budget for it 
 our reform to access to work be not about saving they be about ensure that this brilliant service be available to more people in future we be also look at how it might be deliver whether it will continue to be deliver through the department or through an arm ’s length body or indeed an organisation run by and for disabled people this be a big opportunity to make change to a brilliant programme and i know that the select committee will engage with we on this 
 what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that the financial reparation that will be make to lgbt veteran follow the etherton review be not take into consideration when assess entitlement to other benefit 
 there be an issue with compensation payment more widely and the right hon gentleman give an example of a current case we be look at how we can ensure that people who receive those payment be protect 
 south shields will be the most negatively impact constituency if the government ’s propose welfare change go ahead yet there be no in person consultation event in the north east at all can my right hon friend please rectify that 
 i will absolutely take that away to look at it 
 so many disabled member of society be unable to demonstrate the minimum academic requirement to get on to many course or to secure employment what step be the government take to support those people so that they can demonstrate vocational and non academic competency and get the job that they deserve 
 that be exactly the point of our change to jobcentre and the £ of investment in employment support so that we can understand the pathway to work for people who have skill and talent but as the hon gentleman say perhaps not quite the right qualification 
 more than people in the uk be not actively seek work with long term illness cite as the single large reason do the minister agree that rather than penalise those who be sick or disabled the government should introduce a wealth tax to fund a   genuine transformation of our public service enable we to face the future with a healthy happy and more productive workforce 
 i refer my hon friend to the fair tough choice in the autumn budget there be increase in inheritance tax capital gain tax and dividend tax and there be fair taxis on private jet and private school for what purpose to fund investment in our public service with £ extra every year by the end of this parliament this be bring an end to an era of austerity those be the fair choice that this government have make and will continue to make 
 a number of constituent of mine in edinburgh west former police officer and former and current nhs staff have come to i with concern about the way the mccloud judgment on public sector pension be be implement and worry that they will be negatively impact at great cost how will the government ensure that there be no negative impact 
 the implementation of the mccloud judgment unfortunately of the sad consequence of botch reform under the liberal democrat and conservative coalition government before be important and we need to take it seriously if there be specific case please do write to i about they i be aware of the issue about make sure that scheme member get the detail from the nhs pension scheme and we be work together closely to make sure member get those letter as soon as possible 
 i call perran moon 
 meur ra mr speaker some of the most vulnerable people in my camborne redruth and hayle constituency have profound anxiety about what the change to personal independence payment eligibility criterion will mean for they what step be the minister take to communicate to people who will never be able to work again that the new process will not subject they to unnecessary and degrading assessment 
 my hon friend raise an important point i recognise that there be a good deal of concern at the moment and we want to ensure that people respond fully to our consultation set out in the green paper we have say clearly in the green paper that we will ensure that those who will never be able to work will not go through repeat reassessment that will be build into the system initially the people who will benefit from that will be those who meet the work capability assessment ’s severe condition criterion 
 today be world me day and i hope that the secretary of state and her ministers will recognise the up to people who live with i and me like symptom and some of those with long covid all they want be to have a normal life i recognise what she have say about make pip work for fluctuate condition can i ask she to work with her colleague in the department of health and social care to put aside research funding so that money be available to ensure that those who would love nothing more than to live a normal life and go to work can get well 
 i will certainly discuss that with the health secretary we have a joint work and health programme and team who be really try to join these issue up   the hon member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt   have make her point very strongly in the house and i be sure that she will do so again at health and social care question 
 the middlesbrough disabled supporters association do vital work to support disabled boro fan but it be currently be hammer by increase bank charge will the minister for disability work across government to help take these bank to task so that non profit disability group such as the mdsa can continue their important work 
 i be aware that there be concern along those line across the charity sector as a whole i would be delighted to work with my hon friend to address the concern in middlesbrough specifically 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make a statement on the failure of the prison estate to protect staff from serious and sustained violence by high risk inmate 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i be shock and sadden to hear about the serious assault against a prison officer that take place on   thursday may   at hmp belmarsh my thought be with the family and colleague of the brave hard work prison officer at this time we will not tolerate any violence against prison officer prisoner who be violent towards staff will face the full consequence of their action 
 the incident at hmp belmarsh be subject to a police investigation as such we be unable to comment far in any level of detail at this stage the prison service have also commission an investigation and its term of reference be be finalise it will include detail of what happen and why as well as recommendation to prevent recurrence we will provide update to parliament in due course separately on   april   we announce to parliament an independent review of the recent terrible incident where staff be assault by hashem abedi at hmp frankland we will make further announcement in the come day 
 our prison officer be some of the hard work and brave public servant this country have we be committed to ensure that they be safe at work and be able to keep the public safe we announce at last the justice oral question that the prison service have commission a rapid review of access to and use of self cook area across the prison estate include their use in special unit the review will report back with recommendation in june we recently announce a review of conduct energy device also know as taser and there be a trial involve a small number of national operational response and resilience unit staff 
 body wear video camera baton pava spray and rigid bar handcuff be currently available for use by staff and protective body armour be already wear by specialist prison staff and officer in case where there be plan use of force or where safe system of work for the management of high risk prisoner dictate we have also announce a review into whether protective body armour should be make available to frontline staff and that review will report in june i repeat the safety and security of our frontline prison staff be our no priority 
 let i place on record our sympathy to the prison officer injure at hmp belmarsh we wish they a full recovery and thank all prison officer for their courage in the face of grow danger 
 let we be clear about what be happen in our prison violence against officer have spiral out of control in just the past month of britain ’s most dangerous terrorist axel rudakubana and hashem abedi have launch vicious attack on officer in of our supposedly most secure prison the secretary of state order a snap review into the attack at hmp frankland   but week later we have no answer and no action every day it go on the safety of officer be at risk so i ask the minister when will this review conclude why have every prison officer expose to dangerous inmate not already be provide with a stab vest not in june but today i have speak to officer who say that attack with boiling water be not uncommon will the minister commit to order the removal of every kettle from high risk prisoner not in june but today 
 this go deep than review man like rudakubana and abedi glorify violence and dream of martyrdom and still governor pander to they i could not care less if rudakubana never have a hot drink again nor would the british public this culture of appeasement and protect the right of convict terrorist and criminal over the safety of our officer must end now if that mean keep they in cell with just a bed so be it if it mean no contact no privilege and certainly no cup of tea so be it let segregation truly and finally mean segregation 
 i want to say this as clearly as i can i warn the house now that if the government do not get a grip a prison officer will be kill we have have enough review we need action that be the least that prison officer deserve 
 we be manage the most complex people in the most complex system our prison staff have to manage extremely dangerous people and they do it with real bravery we will do whatever it take to keep they safe that be why we have already take the action that we have 
 all prison carry out regular risk assessment and implement associate safe system of work if a risk be identify regard kettle use or intelligence be receive that might be use in an assault the kettle will be withdraw frankly kettle be use for year under the previous government ’s watch as they rightly trust the professional skill and expertise of those run and work in our prison that be what we be do now 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 last week the justice committee visit wandsworth prison and note improvement but from a very low base we hear that the poor reputation of some prison include rise violence make recruitment more difficult that be the legacy of year of starve prison of resource what be the current government do to improve the recruitment and retention of prison officer 
 my hon friend be completely correct we inherit a prison system in crisis where prison be on the edge of collapse reduce violence in prison be a key priority that be why we have take the action we have in build new prison and in the sentencing review to ensure that we always have prison space to lock dangerous people up 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 no prison officer should go to work in fear that they may leave in an ambulance i therefore send my sympathy and those of the liberal democrats to the officer injure at   hmp belmarsh assault on prison staff have double since a reality for which the conservatives should hang their head in shame 
 the government must now get a grip the prison officers association which be hold its conference in my constituency this week have request more protective equipment the ministry of justice be review that but will it accelerate the review to ensure that officer get that support now not next month 
 recruitment and retention issue also compromise prison officer safety so what be the government do to address that will not discontinue prison officer graduate scheme such as unlocked graduates compromise safety how be the moj robustly rehabilitate violent offender to reduce the risk they pose to prison officer and our community 
 immediately after the incident at hmp frankland the lord chancellor the prisons minister in the other place and i meet the prison officers association that be a significant discussion and commitment be make to ensure that thing be address properly and correctly the prisons minister will be speak shortly at the prison officers association conference 
 the review that be in place be be do in fast time but they need to be do properly so that we can learn the lesson and take the appropriate action they also need input from the people who know exactly what be go on those in the workforce and those who manage our prison 
 i confirm my interest as a member of the justice committee do the minister agree that overcrowding in prison be a cause of increase violence towards our prison officer and that that be a direct result of how the previous government deal with our prison system will he please outline what step be be take to reduce overcrowding in our prison 
 my hon friend be completely right to say that prison overcrowding make address these issue far more difficult that be why the government have pledge to continue build the remain prison place which the last government fail to deliver in month this government have already add more than prison place the conservative government add place in year 
 surely as a minimum any prisoner who assault a prison officer should automatically forfeit any right to early release and all privilege do the minister agree if so when will he introduce that change if not why not 
 the right hon member be right to say that anything that happen should be deal with immediately by the prison authority and that be exactly what be happen that be why these review be in place to learn the lesson so that appropriate action can be take and appropriate step put in place for the future take into account the issue she raise among other 
 this government inherit a violent squalid prison estate which make the job of prison officer much more difficult and dangerous the privatising of maintenance have contribute to overcrowding and the spiral of violence towards prison officer so can the minister explain why contract be be retendere also will he release the report recommend more privatisation so that we can all understand the logic behind this decision 
 my hon friend raise a question about prison maintenance that be always under review contract be in place when this government come into office that need to be take forward to ensure that our prison be keep as safe as possible those who be assess as pose a raise risk of violence be support through a case management approach that be centre around the individual and address the underlying cause of their violence include specific risk factor and need to help they manage and move away from violent behaviour 
 i support the shadow secretary of state ’s request for accelerate the supply of stab vest can i ask the minister for a bit more detail on the government ’s thinking on the use of taser there be a long track record of taser use in the uk and it would seem that we could also accelerate the use of tasers in prison as quickly as possible 
 i agree with the right hon member that this need to be look at as quickly as possible this summer an operational trial on tasers will be launch involve specialised officer to help staff respond to high risk incident more effectively the finding of the trial will inform any future decision about the use of taser in the prison estate we need to learn from what we do so that we can get it right in the future 
 i declare an interest as an honorary life member of the prison officers association i thank the minister for the working relationship he have establish with the union since come into office but could i ask he to liaise with the poa and urgently bring forward a report prison by prison about staffing level and the timescale set aside for training staff particularly to deal with the violent prisoner they be deal with at the moment 
 i be very happy to continue to work with the prison officers association and other staff association work in the prison sector to try to address the issue that my right hon friend rightly raise 
 the minister very graciously find time in his busy schedule to meet i and colleague recently to discuss the be too late campaign do he agree that recent event prove the tremendous pressure on our prison officer and staff and will he give an undertaking to i and the house that during the course of this parliament the term and condition of prison officer could be review especially with a view to the be too late campaign 
 i thank the hon member for his question and for meet i early in this parliament to discuss these issue yes these thing rightly need to be keep under review and the conversation take place with the workforce through the prison officers association and other body will continue to make progress on this matter 
 violence in prison escalate for year under the previous government who leave our prison at break point what be the minister do to bring down level of violence in our jail 
 my hon friend be right to point that out a violence reduction training module be available to all staff to help they well understand the driver of violence and how to mitigate and manage those risk include the use of a case management model for those at raise risk of be violent measure to ease prison crowding be vital for improve prison safety as we know that crowded condition can fuel violence in recent year prison have expand security measure such as x ray body scanner and airport style enhance gate security to tackle the smuggling of drug mobile phone and other contraband that can drive violence in prison we must always be alert and move thing forward because the situation be forever change 
 do the minister accept that the safety and security of our prison officer should always come before protect the right of convict criminal will he provide stab vest and tasers for all officer who request they 
 i agree wholeheartedly that the safety and security of our prison staff must always come and foremost to address the other part of the hon member ’s question i have already indicate that a review be go on that need to be do properly and effectively and we will come back and inform the house in due course 
 violence in prison rise sharply as investment and staffing fall under the previous government i speak to a prison officer who get an award for his bravery in deal with of the many incident at the prison he take his daughter to receive the award and afterwards she beg he to stop do the job he no long be a prison officer after that what be the government do to halt the level of violence and increase staffing level 
 i congratulate that prison officer for the award he get and the work he do the assault on emergency workers offences act require court to consider the fact that serious offence be commit against emergency worker the police crime sentencing and courts act double the maximum penalty to year so there be action in place but we need to be ever vigilant on this matter that be why   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick   be right to ask the urgent question we need to be ever vigilant and work ever hard with the brilliant people who run and work in our prison 
 as co chair of the justice union parliamentary group i know that union have be raise the problem of safety and violence against staff in prison for year under the previous government which underfunde they and let they down will the minister commit to meet union at the launch in july of the newly update safe inside prison charter develop by the joint unions in prisons alliance a coalition of union represent worker in prison and that his majesty ’s prison and probation service will accept the recommendation in the charter 
 i be happy to meet those union and the right hon member on the charter obviously until we see the charter it be difficult to know where thing be go on that but i be sure that hmpps will be proactive in work with all the association on get the charter right 
 minister will recall the horrific attack on prison staff at hmp frankland in durham last month while i be grateful for the minister for prisons reply to my correspondence i note the lack of commitment around the issuing of stab proof vest on the high security estate that be a key ask from the prison officers association while i welcome the minister ’s word today when he say that it will be look into i ask that it be do at pace because too many prison officer be worried about whether they will come out of work in their own vehicle or in the back of an ambulance 
 where an assessment be need for stab proof vest now they can be deploy but follow the recent incident at hmp frankland hmpps have commission a review to establish whether it be necessary for prison officer to wear protective body armour routinely the review will inform any decision on the use of protective body armour on the prison estate and will report in june june be next month so it be happen pretty quickly and rightly so because this be an urgent issue 
 we all understand the need to strike the right operational atmosphere and balance in prison but in the interest of the retention and recruitment of prison officer which be absolutely key if our prison estate be to work effectively i hope that irrespective of what the review might advise the minister and the department will move speedily to a position whereby the wearing of anti stab clothing and the carrying of tasers and other equipment become de facto and routine rather than merely happen in response to glean internal intelligence otherwise there will be a crisis in the retention and recruitment of officer 
 it be crucial that prison officer be equip with the right protective equipment to do their job safely and securely the purpose of these review be to ensure that we get that right 
 many of my constituent work at hmp frankland which be in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for city of durham mary kelly foy i meet representative of the   prison officers association last week of the concern they raise be about equipment they say that during the horrific terrorist attack by hashem abedi they be unable to use baton because the space be too small to wield they and he be so enraged that pepper spray have no effect on he they clearly need additional equipment so what step be be take on that if as the poa tell i activist lawyer and the court be insist that dangerous terrorist prisoner have access to kettle and the ability to use kitchen will the government consider change to primary legislation to enable those privilege to be remove from that category of prisoner 
 let i say straightaway that access to kitchen have be immediately withdraw a review of equipment be take place the point that my hon friend make about the intelligence he have have from prison officer at hmp frankland illustrate the complexity around that issue that be why we need to take our time to get this right while move at pace and come back to the house fairly quickly 
 prison staff be kill in northern ireland by terrorist and their criminal associate what step be the minister take to ensure that our prison officer staff be safe both inside and outside prison as we see an escalation in terrorist activity across this united kingdom will he raise that issue at the nation forum on prison 
 i can certainly commit to ensure that that be raise at the nation forum the hon gentleman raise a sensitive and serious issue that need to be address in the right and proper way i thank he for his question 
 i have meet constituent who be prison officer they agree with the former justice secretary who say that prison officer cut be too much and lead to overcrowding and unsafe condition this labour government be rebuild the trust of prison officer with a pay award whereas the conservatives run away from make such an award what engagement do the minister have with prison officer to understand what safety change they want particularly the use of taser and stab proof vest 
 my hon friend make a good point about the way in which the government immediately recognise the need for an uplift in pay in line with the independent pay report and take action straightaway as i say immediately after the terrible incident at hmp frankland the lord chancellor the prisons minister in the other place and i meet the prison officers association line be open with all the other staff association across the piece it be important that we work with they to address this issue properly
