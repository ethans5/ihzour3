i be grateful for be able to contribute to this debate it be a privilege to follow so many powerful speech and the speech deliver by my hon friend   the member for luton north sarah owen   be the most powerful i have hear in this place her word rise to the moment mine be inadequate by comparison i can only thank she for speak so powerfully about an issue that affect so many of we 
 i welcome the new secretary of state to his place and thank he for the way in which he open this debate 
 at the outset i draw the house ’s attention to my background as an officer of the gmb union and my current unpaid role as chair of the gmb parliamentary group in that capacity i thank   the hon member for dundee central chris law as he leave the chamber for what he say about member staff in this place gmb be the union that represent the majority of people who work in support of we as member of this house i be sad to say that they be perhaps uniquely vulnerable to some of the abusive practice that have sham our democracy for too long and i be at a loss to understand how the relevant lords amendment be ever bring forward from the other place 
 i wish to speak specifically against lords amendment and and in support of the government amendment that seek to strike they out before do so i want to say a few word about my hon friend   the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders who be not in his place at the moment as a former shadow minister and latterly as the sponsoring minister for this bill he unfailingly and characteristically bring graft industry and good humour to the brief this will be a weak and less bill without he and those of we who support the bill and its principle owe he a debt of thank i be glad that my hon friend   the member for halifax kate dearden who bring a real depth of knowledge and understanding to the role of under secretary of state for business and trade be now guard the bill ’s passage to royal assent i know that she will be both pro worker and pro business in her approach 
 i believe that lords amendment contain significant drafting weakness and would fundamentally alter the nature of the propose and restore school support staff negotiate body the amendment state that employer may introduce new term and condition of employment that 
 meet or exceed any minimum standard set by the sssnb 
 in legal term however the sssnb will not set or determine those standard it be a statutory forum for negotiation the actual condition of employment will be set through regulation draft by the secretary of state and approve by parliament 
 secondly the actual parameter of a future pay and grade structure will be negotiate by the relevant party the representative of employer and the representative of employee that be the spirit of the original act and the actual operation of the sssnb in its original incarnation give my experience as a former trade union officer represent school support staff i know the contractual issue that need to be address be so complicated that they can not be satisfactorily resolve on the floor of the house that complexity be a result of year of drift dither and political disinter in the support staff worker in england who keep our school go and it be a damn indictment of the decision to cancel the original sssnb 
 finally lords amendment risk create confusion at a local level the amendment state that employer must not be restrict from introduce improve term and condition but change to contract be not merely introduce they be consult on and agree either individually or collectively under exist statute the effect of the somewhat loose wording in the amendment may be to encourage local attempt to make unilateral variation to contract and term and condition member who support this amendment might say that only improvement could be make under it but both improvement and detriment be subjective term they be in the eye of the beholder and i believe that if the amendment be to be carry through the actual effect may be to increase the number of court case concern school support staff 
 i urge the opposition not to push a point and to reconsider their wide opposition to the school support staff negotiate body school support staff undertake essential role and they deserve the same professional    standard and professional respect that be afford to teacher that be what the restoration of the school support staff negotiate body will achieve 
 we have debate the official opposition ’s amendment many time at various stage but i want to comment on some of the lords amendment that stand in the name of liberal democrat peer either in whole or in part when i enter this chamber at the start of the debate i do not presume that those amendment necessarily enjoy the support of the liberal democrat front benchers in the commons but i be afraid that impression be dispel by the contribution from the liberal democrat spokesperson   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney 
 i be at a loss to understand how the radical change in approach have come about among the liberal democrats in this house between committee stage report reading and the debate that we be hold today in fact listen to the hon lady i feel an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu it be like watch the rose garden press conference all over again after all her front bench colleague the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson and for torbay steve darling)—were at all time appropriately critical in committee but they be essentially supportive of the principle of enhance worker right lord amendment which be originally a conservative amendment in the commons but now stand in the name of a liberal democrat peer be not support by the liberal democrats in committee 
 lords amendment which stand in the name of both liberal democrat and conservative peer seek to amend clause however the liberal democrats support that clause in committee and only voice concern which be reasonable that timely guidance to employer must be issue to accompany it indeed they vote with labour members when it be put to a vote in committee i fear that this amendment too could have serious unintended consequence 
 the clause that it seek to amend put a duty on employer to offer regular hour contract to workers”—that be the language use in the legislation as it stand at the moment but the amendment seek to convert that duty into a right to request by employee employee be of course a more restrictive category than worker indeed clause of the bill as draft make it clear that for the purpose of the interpretation of this bill worker and employee mean different thing many of the people who be class only as worker be precisely those who may benefit the most from these protection some people who be nominally casual worker in sector such as social care construction hospitality security and retail could be exclude from these protection if the amendment which stand in the name of conservative and liberal democrat peer be to be carry i hope it be not the intention of those on the conservative benches to exclude those people at the start of this debate i could not believe that that be the intention of the liberal democrats but now i be not so sure 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what discussion she have have with the mayor of london on the closure of front counter at police station 
 it be clear to we that visible policing be essential to restore public confidence in our police which be why there will be more neighbourhood police on the beat by april next year under this labour government the metropolitan police will receive up to £ in a £ increase in funding through the settlement 
 may i as a london member begin by pay tribute to the brave police officer from the met and many other force who be police protest on saturday a number of whom be injure in the line of duty as a result of abhorrent attack i be sure that the thought and prayer of all member in all part of the house be with they 
 last week we discover that sadiq khan the mayor of london have admit that he have know as long ago as november that the met plan to close a number of police front counter across london have promise just month early in his election manifesto that not a single borough would be leave without a police front counter the decision to close twickenham ’s counter mean that richmond upon thames will be leave without do the minister agree that give the importance of police counter in maintain trust in and accessibility to our police this decision need to be reverse do she also agree that the mayor of london have break his promise and that the metropolitan police should be fund properly 
 may i associate myself with the comment make by the hon member at the start of her question as she would expect we have be in close contact with the met throughout the weekend our thought be with the officer who be injure some of they seriously and we must of course ensure that justice be do for they they run into danger for we every day 
 it be clear to i that the mayor of london be make the right decision on police across london of course member will feel that their particular police station be important and of course visible policing be important what our community be say what my community in croydon be say to i be that they want to see police on our street tackle crime not sit behind desk do the job that unwarranted police officer could be do and that be why we be put neighbourhood police at the heart of our policy and put those officer back on our street by april next year 
 a constituent of mine try to act as a good samaritan by hand in a handbag that they have find in the town centre but they could not do so because hemel hempstead police station ’s front desk have be close under the last government they be tell that they would have to travel to hatfield police station which be half an hour away do the minister i welcome she to her place agree that the hemel hempstead front desk should be reopen so that the police can be even more accessible to our constituent 
 order i be not sure that the minister have responsibility for matter such as this 
 i be of course happy to talk to my hon friend about the situation in his local community so we can ensure that the police be do all they can to tackle all the crime that be not consider a priority under the last government from antisocial behaviour to low level threat that be extremely important to our community 
 i call the shadow minister 
 let i begin by welcome the new ministers to their place 
 the last conservative government recruit a record number of police officer but early this year we discover that despite labour ’s promise of more police the headcount have already fall by since it come to office both the national police chiefs council and the metropolitan police commissioner have warn that we will lose even more officer when will the minister restore police number to the level they be at under the last conservative government 
 i thank my opposite number for his welcome let i also use this opportunity to thank the minister of state department for work and pensions my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson who do a brilliant job as policing minister over the past year 
 under the last couple of year of the conservative government shoplift soar we see a increase street theft rise by in year and the conservatives ignore antisocial behaviour violence and abuse against shop worker be at epidemic level and the yo yoing of the police number do not help the hon gentleman may remember that the conservatives cut they by we be prioritise neighbourhood policing we will ensure that the police have the resource that they   need and we will use new technology to ensure that we be tackle crime as much as we can those neighbourhood police officer will be in place by next year and the police officer that we have pledge in our manifesto will make a real difference to people ’s life 
 may i gently say that the question be about the mayor of london and police closure we have allow a little bit of leeway let we see how we go from here and try to stick to the question before we 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her department 's policy of the approval under the animals scientific procedures act between april and june of the use of animal over the next year 
 the department take its responsibility under the animals scientific procedures act extremely seriously approval for the use of animal in science be give only when no alternative exist and where the scientific benefit justify the potential harm the government will soon publish a strategy on how we will work towards phase out the use of animal in science 
 more than animal have be approve for test over the next year include through licence for invasive brain research on monkey and for look at different method of kill animal in laboratory labour ’s manifesto commit to phase out animal testing can the minister reassure i that the non animal method strategy will commit to herbie ’s law and provide a clear framework for phase out animal experiment within the next decade 
 i be grateful to the hon member herbie ’s law be a propose legislative framework to phase out animal experiment specifically in medical research in the uk by the government ’s commitment be clear we will partner with scientist industry and civil society to work towards a long term goal of phase out the use of animal in scientific research and testing i will ensure that he receive a letter from the relevant minister 
 i thank the minister for his answer it be quite clear that people have have their life save through scientific experiment with animal and we thank the scientist for that at the same time a grow number of people have grave concern include my constituent and probably the minister ’s constituent as well can he assure we that when it come to do animal experiment of any sort the priority will always be the people who can be save as a result of the experiment but it will also be the care of the animal that be what my people want and i think it be what everybody want 
 i can give the hon gentleman that assurance the government authorise the use of animal in science under the animals scientific procedures act in   order to support critical national objective in public health scientific innovation and environmental protection the authorisation provide by the regulator be not a blanket approval but a tightly regulate process that have rigorous and robust ethical legal and scientific scrutiny 
 what step she be take to help prevent migrant from cross the english channel illegally 
 under this government the national crime agency have lead disruption of immigration crime network its high level on record and a increase on the previous year we be pass legislation to give both the national crime agency and law enforcement more power to arrest those suspect of facilitate people smuggle at a much early stage i be very sorry to see that the hon member do not match his rhetoric with real action by vote for those measure when they be before the house 
 i have it on good authority that the people smuggler in northern europe be absolutely delighted with labour ’s new front bench team and especially with the promotion of   the hon member for dover and deal mike tapp because they know we will get more of the same from this labour government the boat will keep come the boat will get big and the people smuggler will make more money what difference be this home secretary go to make that the last home secretary could not 
 i think the hon member have just admit to have a hotline to a bunch of people smuggler perhaps he would like to contact the national crime agency and tell it that he be in touch with a bunch of criminal so that they can be appropriately deal with all he and his party have be a bunch of rhetoric and no answer to the problem that the previous government leave behind it be this government who will clean up the mess and secure our border 
 illegal immigration be by definition an international crime that be why it be so important that we work with our ally such as france in target this issue which affect our community i welcome the government ’s in out deal with france which have the potential to be the most game change step in british migration policy in decade can the minister give we an update on how the in out deal be go and have she speak to her counterpart in france in her new role 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that international co operation be the key to we secure our border here at home and assist our international partner to do the same with theirs i be already in touch with my french counterpart that be a landmark agreement which the conservatives try to achieve for many year but they be all word and no action it be this government who strike that   landmark deal and we be work with our partner in france to get the flight off the ground as soon as possible 
 i congratulate the right hon lady on her appointment and i wish she every success it be in the national interest and the national security interest that this issue be tackle but her front bench colleague and the prime minister be absolutely wrong to get rid of a deterrent notwithstanding all the new policy all the new bills and all the new relabelling and rebadging of organisation unless there be a deterrent the illegal migrant will continue to cross the channel as they have do since this government come to power when be a deterrent go to be put in place and what will it look like 
 i welcome the tone of the part of the right hon gentleman ’s question it be in our collective national interest that we secure our border and i look forward to work with member from across the house as we get on with that important task it be important not just to prevent criminality but to hold our own country together which be why i have always say i will do whatever it take 
 the rwanda agreement which be what the right hon gentleman refer to as a deterrent be nothing of the sort from the day that agreement be sign to the day it be cancel people cross into this country that show it be not a deterrent that be ever go to work i be clear that i will do whatever it take i be already consider other measure that will deter people from make that crossing in the place and i will update the house in due course 
 immigration be still a big issue for my constituent they email about it and it come up when i be in the pub but people ’s frustration be turn to direct action and northampton be now fill with flag do the home secretary agree that flag be a symbol of our pride in our country and they should not be hijack by plastic patriot and those who do not work in our country ’s interest 
 let i be very clear i understand the strength of feeling across community in this country about the use of hotel in particular the right to protest be an ancient right in this country and we will protect it but it be important that we do not slip into rhetoric that incite violence or hatred towards other community i love the st george ’s flag and i love the union jack those flag belong to i as much as they do to anybody else and we must never allow any of our flag to become symbol of division 
 i call the shadow minister 
 lot of people know that under this government the number of people arrive illegally have hit a record high what many do not know be that this labour government be repeal the power to scientifically test the age of those arrive and be hide the datum on the number make false claim about their age why be the government do away with power that could prevent adult migrant from get into classroom with child and why be they hide this datum from the british people 
 come from of the conservative members who frankly do nothing across their period in office and who be responsible for the mess i be have to clear up i think that be a little bit rich this government have be absolutely transparent we will carry on be so and we will publish all the relevant datum at the appropriate time i be very clear that nobody who try to game our system will get away with it we will strengthen our rule rather than weaken they which be what we see under the conservative party 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 many of those who come to this country by cross the channel go on to be grant refugee status early this month the government backtrack on their promise to continue with the day move on period for those grant refugee status barely week after a home office minister assure this house that the policy would last until the end of the year the move on period extension be work in that it be give refugee time to secure work and housing while shield local council from sudden surge in homelessness cause by people be force out of asylum accommodation too quickly halve the move on period be bad for refugee who want to support themselves bad for the community support they until they can get on their foot and certainly bad for already stretch council budget do the home secretary agree that it be well to do what work both for refugee and for community welcome they and will she look again at reinstate a policy that work rather than chase headline 
 i say to the hon lady that we be follow what be work rather than have an arbitrary time period we be work with local authority to make sure we have the appropriate move on period it be in nobody ’s interest that people remain in hotel for long than be absolutely necessary and of course this government will end the use of asylum hotel 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 what step she be take to help ensure the delivery of effective community policing 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 every day the police make we safe but the public be rightly concerned that there be crime that blight their community and too often go unpunished we be focus police on the crime that matter to local community we have deliver the neighbourhood policing guarantee include a dedicated name officer in each neighbourhood guarantee response time and more officer by april 
 the devon base devon and cornwall police and crime commissioner announce month ago with great fanfare that camborne in my constituency would be a focus for she there have be very little evidence of that increase focus since she also say that redruth would not be a focus because it be not a business improvement district neighbourhood policing performance in the town of camborne redruth and hayle be inextricably link will the home secretary meet i and cornish colleague to discuss neighbourhood police across cornwall 
 i be very sorry to hear about those issue with the police and crime commissioner in my hon friend ’s local area it be important that those concern be listen to i would be very happy for he to meet the minister for policing and crime my hon friend   the member for croydon west sarah jones 
 i welcome the action the government be take to strengthen neighbourhood police in wolverhampton with additional role and officer newly allocate or move back into neighbourhood role year of cut have leave west midland police with around few officer than in and a funding formula that short change our region by £ every year will my right hon friend commit to review the tories funding formula so my constituency can have the same level of neighbourhood policing and security as other part of the country 
 as a fellow west midland member of parliament i of course hear my hon friend ’s concern but she will understand that as with previous year decision on police force funding allocation will be make via the police funding settlement which be take place later in the year 
 i commend the government for their commitment to neighbourhood policing not least the propose power in the crime and policing bill that will empower officer to stop antisocial and illegal e scooter riding which have be a dangerous blight across stevenage town centre however do my right hon friend not agree that we should be give police the legislation and guidance they need to keep our local neighbourhood safe rather than arrest individual for post on social medium view that while consider offensive by some be nowhere near the bar for incite criminal behaviour 
 on the part of my hon friend ’s question he be absolutely right about strengthen neighbourhood police to deal with the concern he raise that be why we have bring forward new power in the crime and policing bill i agree that it be important that the line between that which be perfectly legal fair   comment even if offensive and that which be illegal be maintain as strongly as possible i have already have conversation with senior police officer on this matter and i be pleased to see statement from for example the chief of the met police i will be meet they in more detail to make sure that that line be not cross so we can maintain confidence in our police 
 the prime minister promise there would be a summer blitz on antisocial behaviour with more funding and more community police officer promise for our constituency yet this summer in cheadle village we have see even more antisocial behaviour in the community throughout the summer i be contact by resident about crime in the area include police officer attack a local school break into and neighbour threaten for simply ask gang not to throw rock at their house of my constituent adam tell i it be the bad he have ever see it why do the summer blitz on antisocial behaviour not include cheadle 
 more than town centre across england and wales have see the benefit of that summer initiative i will ask my official question about the hon gentleman ’s area in particular but it be an important model that we have trialle this year we look forward to build on it as we ensure we have the local response and neighbourhood police to deal with local concern build confidence so that people can enjoy our town centre as they use to do 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to the neighbourhood police guarantee to restore bobby on the beat in our town centre follow year of conservative cut that have leave our town and village at the mercy of shoplifter and antisocial behaviour will the home secretary outline how lancashire and in particular my constituency of blackpool north and fleetwood will benefit from that guarantee 
 the neighbourhood policing guarantee be absolutely critical to deal with the issue that my hon friend raise and to raise confidence more generally the guarantee will ensure that all area include her constituency will have a name dedicated officer guarantee patrol and reliable response time and will give community absolute clarity about local police priority 
 how can persistent shoplifter be deter if short sentence be abolish 
 the right hon gentleman be ask i a question relate to my previous brief but he will be pleased to know that i expect the new justice secretary and lord chancellor to set out proposal for deal with prolific shoplifter in particular base on some of the conversation and exchange he and i have have i know it be a big problem but the government will have a response to tackle the scourge of prolific shoplifting 
 i be contact by constituent yesterday from the pound street mosque and riverside community centre mosque who have   hear comment from the unite the kingdom rally about islam not be welcome in this country or in europe how can neighbourhood police help to reassure my constituent and the practise muslims in this country that they have the right to practise their faith without fear 
 freedom of conscience religion and belief be a protect freedom in this country it be part of the right and responsibility that we have as citizen of this great nation and nothing should get in the way of that freedom of speech be also protect in this country there will always be some crossover between those freedom but as i say in answer to a previous question i be absolutely clear that there be a line between content that be offensive rude or ill mannered and incitement whether to violence or hatred which be a crime it be important that we police the line between those type of comment effectively so that everybody in this country can have confidence in our police system as well as confidence in exercise their right under the law of our land 
 last week be rural crime action week i recently have an opportunity to join cambridgeshire constabulary ’s rural crime action team to see the work that it do despite have to cover a huge county of constituency with just officer those officer have recently be reallocate from be designate operational support unit officer to neighbourhood police officer thus bolster the number of officer the government will classify as neighbourhood police and help they to reach the target of officer however those officer be neither new nor dedicated neighbourhood police can the home secretary explain why she be artificially inflate neighbourhood police number by reclassify those in specialist role 
 the government ’s policy position be to ensure that the police resource that we have focus on neighbourhood policing because we know that visible neighbourhood policing increase the confidence that community have in go about their business and help we to take back our town centre from those who indulge in low level criminality which be not low level because it harm people and their confidence in their own community that be why we make no secret and be not ashamed of our neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 very simple question why be police number come down under a labour government 
 this government be focus on deliver neighbourhood policing we be go to have neighbourhood police officer by april with as we commit in our manifesto by the end of the parliament 
 what step her department be take to support ukrainian national with their visa application 
 i call the minister welcome 
 this government remain committed to support ukraine follow russia ’s vile illegal invasion i acknowledge the warmth and generosity show by so many local community in support ukrainians in the uk since the conflict begin more than ukrainians have be offer temporary sanctuary through the dedicated ukraine scheme ukrainians can still apply to the homes for ukraine scheme with a uk sponsor and once here extend their stay to a total of year as recently announce 
 i start by congratulate the minister and welcome he to his place my constituent lesley have be host and support a ukrainian refugee ella who after month of delay and difficulty have thankfully now receive a visa extension ella ’s case highlight the wide problem in the system long wait radio silence and a lack of communication cause huge distress for the refugee and their host can the minister set out what be be do to improve the visa application system generally and secondly whether the government will consider look again at allow ukrainian refugee who do not want to or can not return to ukraine the pathway and the chance of apply for indefinite leave to remain 
 i thank my hon friend for her congratulation and her hard work in this area the uk government have be clear from the outset that the ukraine scheme be temporary and do not offer a direct route to settlement the ukraine permission extension scheme reflect our strong humanitarian commitment while also this be important respect ukraine ’s wish for its citizen to return when safe to support national recovery the long term position be under active consideration and further detail will be provide at the early opportunity 
 what step her department be take to help tackle crime in city centre 
 the united kingdom boast a fantastic array of city each of which have a unique character and appeal in order to thrive our city centre must be safe that be why this government be put police back on the beat and bring in strong power to crack down on shop theft and antisocial behaviour 
 i be pleased to see newport city council announce last week £ for new cctv in our city centre and i commend the work of trading standard whose effort have seize almost £ of illegal cigarette and vape while trading standard and the police be work really hard to tackle this issue the time limit nature of shop closure order mean that the shop often quickly reopen what more can the government do to strengthen power to stop this 
 i welcome the action in newport city it be good to hear the tobacco and vapes bill will strengthen enforcement and crack down on rogue retailer and a raft of other measure in the bill will crack down on these pernicious crime i look forward to talk more with my hon friend about this 
 sometimes crime wear a suit as happen in brechin in my constituency where mackie motors have equity in their vehicle steal by a french bank base in london then through mendacity or incompetence or both the bank turn off the oxygen for that business of year i have meet with home office and treasury ministers to try to get around this my constituent have be to the financial conduct authority who tell they to go to the police who then tell they to go back to the fca who then tell they to go to citizens advice you could not make this cluster fankle up be it not the case that in the uk today if a small or medium sized enterprise be in dispute with a bank the fca will demonstrate that it be neither use nor ornament 
 i can not comment on the specific detail as i be not aware of that case but i be very happy to have a conversation with the hon member some sme in my constituency have have similar issue so i be very happy to take that forward 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 antisocial behaviour cause untold distress and misery across our community under the previous government the response to this menace be weak and ineffective and visible neighbourhood policing decline dramatically this government be put that right by rebuild neighbourhood police and introduce respect order to tackle persistent perpetrator and strong power to seize dangerous and deafen off road bike 
 i thank the almost constituent who respond to my summer road safety campaign of the top issue raise be the use of antisocial off road bike i warmly welcome new measure in the crime and policing bill to allow the police to seize these bike without warn will my hon friend also look at the sale of off road bike to see what can be do to restrict they at source 
 i think the number of constituent who respond to my hon friend ’s survey show that this be really important for our community and something that we have to get a grip of there have be a worrying increase in such crime as part of our safe street mission   this government be crack down on the crime that make people feel unsafe in our community include snatch theft pickpocketing and robbery our safe street initiative have be run this summer in town centre include in my hon friend ’s constituency i think we aim to prevent crime and antisocial behaviour and the sale of off road bike be at the heart of that 
 in wrexham north wales police be do very important work to tackle persistent antisocial behaviour and low level crime but local people be quite rightly seek further reassurance that these issue will continue to be deal with and tackled head on will the minister please update the house on how police recruitment and training be progress in north wales and beyond so that community like mine can feel safe and secure in the place they call home 
 as part of our commitment to restore neighbourhood policing the neighbourhood police programme career pathway develop by the college of policing be create a structured training pathway to professionalise neighbourhood policing benefit community across england and wales include in wrexham in term of recruitment north wales police have be allocate just over £ to support its project neighbourhood police growth over which be make up of additional police officer and police community support officer 
 in gloucester thank to the government invest £ in neighbourhood policing and a furth £ in its safe street initiative we have see more police on our street this summer lead to an increase in arrest and seizure of illegal e bike and vape some of that funding be to come to an end this autumn will the minister please update i on how she will ensure that gloucestershire constabulary build on the great work it have do this summer to make gloucester a safe place to live and work 
 i thank my hon friend for his question it be encouraging to see the work go on in his constituency it be our intention to ensure that the police have the resource they need to do the job we need they to do whether in hotspot policing neighbourhood police or tackle anti social behaviour we will change legislation here in parliament to ensure they have the power as well as the resource they need to act locally in the interest of our constituent 
 local youth provision go hand in hand with a decrease in antisocial behaviour commit by young people with even something as simple as a ping pong table in a close shop able to make a difference in a community will the minister outline what work she be do with the department for education and the treasury to ensure that we solve this problem once and for all and we do not just move it on and move people around the place 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right if we want to ensure that people be not get into crime we need to ensure they have activity and thing to do we be work closely with both the department for education and the department for culture media and sport to ensure we have a programme of activity   for our young people that give they thing to do and a purpose in life include mentoring and support so that they can take the right path 
 resident of long hanborough in my constituency have describe to i a summer of misery characterise by antisocial behaviour in the local playing field i understand that the local rural police constabulary do not have sufficient vehicle for all its officer to be out at any time be the minister satisfied that thames valley police have sufficient resource in its rural community police force to deal with antisocial behaviour in our village 
 antisocial behaviour be pernicious wherever it happen of course we need to ensure that the police have the right resource as the home secretary say police allocation decision will be make in the autumn but i be happy to have a conversation with the hon member about the particular issue he be face in his constituency to ensure that when it come to issue such as police car and vehicle we be make the most of taxpayer money and make as many efficiency as we can on that front 
 in line with the comment make by my hon friend   the member for maidenhead mr reynolds   about how we good tackle antisocial behaviour among young people do the minister agree that it be really important that outdoor education be integrate in the government ’s youth strategy the draft make no reference to outdoor learning whatsoever yet it be prove to broaden people ’s horizon give people thing to do with their life and make they much less likely to fall into antisocial behaviour 
 i be happy to take that question on board i have speak to the head of all the violence reduction unit across the country today and it be clear that some of the most important work they can do be in partnership with other agency and other body whether in education our youth service or other we need to pull the resource we have together use what work and follow the evidence 
 what step she be take to help reduce level of bureaucracy for frontline police officer 
 the government be commit to tackle bureaucracy and be invest ten of million of pound this year in technology to get officer on to the frontline that include work with police to reduce admin use tool such as automated redaction and artificial intelligence and deploy cutting edge technology such as facial recognition and video response to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of police 
 i recently meet the chief constable of leicestershire and he explain some of the red tape that his force face between april and march 
 it use use of force form these be for when people go into handcuff some of those be for people who be complicit and be happy to be handcuff each time that happen it take an average of minute to fill in of those form if that could be take away it would save the force about £ will the minister look at this and will she meet i to discuss some of the other red tape that we could remove to make policing much more streamlined 
 we need to ensure that the police be do what we need they to be do and that they be out on the street solve crime and not tie up in red tape that be absolutely certain the way to be tough on crime be to be smart on crime and i be happy to look at the hon gentleman ’s suggestion 
 i recently meet a police officer in cambridgeshire who tell i that that force have a policy require all footage from stop and search to be review by a more senior officer due to this they feel discouraged from do proactive patrol due to the extra work that it add for already stretch supervisor will the policing minister write to cambridgeshire ’s conservative police and crime commissioner and urge he to be more proactive on challenge these issue so that our frontline police can spend as much time as possible out in our community 
 i be sorry that my hon friend ’s police and crime commissioner be not do what be need we need to empower the police to be out do what they do well not create barrier for they to do so 
 what step her department be take to help tackle shoplift 
 shop theft hit a record high in the last year of the previous government but our crime and policing bill will remove the effective immunity for shop theft under £ we be invest over £ to support police effort against retail crime over the next year include support a specialist team to target organise gang and offender we also back the tackling retail crime together strategy in which industry and police be collaborate to well target perpetrator 
 as a proud member of the union of shop distributive and allied workers and formerly the young deputy store manager for halford ’s in the east of england i know at hand the fear that shoplifting cause to retail worker what action be my hon friend take to ensure that the police have the power they need to use the full force of the law to tackle those who steal from our shop 
 my hon friend be absolutely right every member of parliament hear about this issue and know how distressing it be the intimidation of shop worker must stop and the thief who target shop and be steal to order must be target we be repeal the legislation that make shop theft of and below £ a summary only offence which will send a clear message that we will not tolerate this crime 
 recently a. c. models in my constituency be target by a series of theft that cost the owner annette and clive thousand of pound yet the shoplifter be order to pay they just £ in compensation with retail loss due to theft at record high what measure be the government take to support small business that be prey on by shoplifter 
 we need to protect retail worker and we need to do more to tackle shop theft as i have just outline we be do just that i be very sorry that the hon lady ’s constituent have have to suffer this terrible crime we need to ensure that the message be loud and clear that we will not accept it 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential merit of disapplye the human rights act to immigration matter 
 clearly the balance between the human right of illegal migrant and the wide public interest be out of kilter this government will legislate to limit the application of article of the european convention on human right which cover the right to a family life this will mean that we can deport and remove more illegal migrant and we will pursue international reform too in my previous role i be already involve in conversation with other member state of the council of europe and this government will continue that work 
 i welcome the home secretary to her position every new appointment come with an opportunity to take a fresh look at these matter clearly since the 1950 when the refugee convention and the european convention on human right be write the world have change significantly successive government have tweak various bit work with partner but do she agree that if we be to stop the small boat that be cross the channel and illegal migration the government will need a more wholesale change 
 i hope the hon gentleman will take a bit of time to look at the speech i make to the council of europe just before the summer recess in which i make a very similar argument to the he be make for those of we who be supporter of the convention and who want to see it stand the test of time we have to recognise that it be a treaty form many decade ago in a different reality and we should have a conversation about whether it be still fit for purpose it be a conversation that other in europe be have and we be take a lead role in those discussion we will pursue international reform and also reform of our domestic legislation 
 by leave the eu the tories tear up our return agreement with the eu and they completely fail to negotiate a new but this government have now rectify that do the home secretary agree that the tories and reform be in cloud cuckoo land if they think that the french would have sign a return deal with we if we have leave the european convention on human right 
 my hon friend be right to point out that the fact that we be sign up to the european convention underpin other international agreement that we have with partner it underpin the good friday agreement it also underpin our treaty with the french on the france return pilot that be why we should be responsible in take forward a conversation on reform of the convention and that be the approach we be take i be take that approach in my previous role and i will carry on do so as home secretary 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i warmly welcome the home secretary to her place i very much look forward to the exchange that we will have so long as the prime minister leave she in post when it come to human right do she not accept that tinker around the edge simply will not work she say in her answer a ago that she want to see the echr reform but her own government ’s attorney general lord hermer say just day ago that echr reform be a political trick perhaps she and the attorney general should get themselves on the same page give that the attorney general say that reform be not possible do she not agree that more fundamental change be need as my hon friend   the member for fylde mr snowden   say a moment ago this year have be the bad in history for illegal immigrant cross the channel the number be up compare with last year only radical change will fix this mess so will the home secretary back the conservative plan to completely disapply the human rights act and ensure that all illegal immigrant be immediately remove upon arrival 
 order you know the score you know we have to get through question when colleague do not get in they will blame the shadow home secretary please try to help other 
 after that performance i have to confess that i find myself rather miss the shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick the shadow minister say that we be tinker at the edge he could not be more wrong we have a proper plan for look at legislative reform but tinker at the edge would have be fantastic under the conservatives because their track record be that they do nothing sod all in year suddenly they have find their reform instinct now that they be in opposition this government will take forward domestic as well as international reform 
 what recent progress she have make on establish a national inquiry into groom gang 
 the process of select a respected and independent chair for the national inquiry into group base child sexual exploitation and abuse be under way a dedicated victim and survivor panel be support the process the inquiry ’s term of reference will of course follow shape by a public consultation the inquiry will be trauma inform and time limit as recommend by baroness casey ensure accountability truth and change 
 it beggar belief that the inquiry inch along at such a dreadfully slow pace with the scottish government rule out an inquiry there will the home secretary please commit to fast track a thoroughgoe inquiry into the grooming gang scandal for the sake of the victim 
 for the sake of the victim who we all think about today we must ensure that we get this right there be multiple issue with the chair at the start of baroness jay ’s inquiry which take many year we want to do what baroness casey have recommend do this right and properly and do this alongside the victim whom we be talk to we must of course lead the way on this we will ensure that we get the right strategy it be for scotland and the scottish government to decide on whether to have a similar strategy it be important to say that alongside have this important national strategy we be put in place lot of other policy to tackle this kind of crime 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the conservatives raise the issue of a national statutory inquiry in january the government attempt to block our call for an inquiry until they be force into a u turn in june on   september the under secretary of state for the home department   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips say 
 this government will not lose any more time in pursue truth and justice for victim and survivor official report   september vol c. 
 yet here we stand today no start date no chair announce and no term of reference agree the victim need action not word so will the minister please tell the victim of these abhorrent crime when the national inquiry will begin or will this secretary of state have to be force into action just like the last 
 i will not take any lesson from the hon lady give that the previous inquiry be not implement in any way shape or form by the previous government through the crime and policing bill we be put in place baroness jay ’s key recommendation which be the right thing to do it be so important that we make the right decision about the chair the term of reference and the process for this inquiry which have victim at its heart we be follow baroness casey ’s advice and as the hon lady will hear soon we will ensure that we have the right chair and the right approach for the victim we can do no less 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i would like to use this statement to address the subject of this weekend ’s event on saturday well over protester march in london many be exercise the ancient right to peaceful protest,—but not everyone do some turn on the brave police officer who be there to keep the peace officer be injure and protester be arrest   those violent thug will face the full force of the law those who turn to violence on saturday do not represent what this country really be when a foreign billionaire call on our citizen to fight against our ancient democracy i know that be meet by the vast majority with a shake of the head that be because we be in truth a tolerant country and yes a diverse too you can be english and have root here that stretch back year but you can also be english and look like i the st george ’s cross and the union jack belong to we all they be symbol of unity a kingdom united and must never be use to divide we 
 i welcome the home secretary to her position do she have plan to introduce a statutory cap on in bind migration 
 i have job and it be to secure our border i will do whatever it take but what i will never do be take the approach of the previous government who be lead by gimmick and false promise that be never meet 
 antisocial behaviour include car produce excessive noise along the southend seafront and westcliff road have long affect my constituent southend city council essex police and i be work hard to address those issue will the home secretary set out how the government be go far fast in tackle antisocial behaviour and how deliver on our commitment to have a name neighbourhood police officer in every community will directly benefit resident 
 this year £ have be make available to force to kick start the delivery of more neighbourhood officer across england and wales i would be very happy to talk to my hon friend about the issue that he be face we must tackle antisocial behaviour

 do the home secretary accept that her predecessor be move because this government be fail on immigration indeed of the public think that the government be fail illegal migration be up make this the bad year in history let i try again will the home secretary take this opportunity to commit to real action back our plan to disapply the human rights act in relation to all immigration matter and immediately remove every illegal immigrant upon arrival 
 i will take no lesson from anyone sit on the conservative benches their government utterly fail on both legal and illegal migration this government and this home secretary will clean up their mess 
 the home secretary have some brass neck this have be the bad year in history with illegal migration up by press report this week suggest that a handful of illegal migrant might be remove to france she have be silent about that so far but that amount to only of people cross do she   accept that allow of illegal immigrant to stay will be no deterrent and will she commit to publish full datum on a weekly basis 
 on the subject of brass neck i will have to buy the shadow home secretary a mirror so that he can stare at as i say i will not take any lesson from he or any conservative this government have get removal up to get asylum decision move again and strike an historic agreement with france we be work with our partner in france to get flight off the ground 
 will the minister give an update on the work of the defend democracy taskforce please 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the question because the target intimidation and harassment of elect representative be completely unacceptable the defend democracy taskforce work to ensure the safety and security of all electoral process and democratic institution and to strengthen democratic society we be conduct a review of the harassment and intimidation face by elect representative the taskforce have also conclude a review of transnational repression and we have update parliament on that i hope this will be a share endeavour right across the house 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 this weekend as the home secretary say elon musk use a rally to call alongside convict criminal so call tommy robinson for the dissolution of parliament and to incite violence on our street give the seriousness of a high profile figure apparently urge attack on our democracy what assessment have the home office make of these statement and what step be be take across government to respond to they and to protect our democracy 
 there be both a legal question here and a political question on the legal question in all case include the that the hon lady raise it be for the police and the crown prosecution service to decide independently whether the law have be break and charge should be bring we would never expect a minister to comment on that it would be improper to do so on the political question let i say this the word that be use at the weekend be abhorrent and i know that the vast majority of people in this country will feel the same way whether you be a hostile state or a hostile foreign billionaire no get to mess with british democracy 
 member of the all party group on anti corruption and responsible tax which i chair have the opportunity to meet national economic crime centre officer last week and discuss the work that necc be do to disrupt money laundering and tax evasion include through its landmark operation machinize high street money laundering be of huge concern to i give the explosion of cash intensive business over recent year seek to hide beneath a veneer of respectability in order to conceal their dirty money what measure be the minister take to empower   trading standard local council his majesty ’s revenue and customs and law enforcement to tackle this issue head on 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and the appg for their work the government be absolutely committed to tackle high street money laundering to deliver safe street and economic growth work closely with partner through multi agency initiative like operation machinize we have strengthen the power under the economic crime and corporate transparency act and have fund new role under the anti money laundering and asset recovery programme to detect and investigate offence 
 just over a week ago nearly peaceful protester include priest and pensioner be arrest in a single day for oppose the ban on palestine action yet over the weekend at the unite the kingdom protest police officer be injure and arrest be make do the home secretary agree with my constituent in dunbartonshire that this raise serious question about proportionality and will she consider reassess the proscription of palestine action 
 any attack on the police be utterly shameful the right to peaceful protest be a cornerstone of our democracy it be a freedom that we protect fiercely but palestine action ’s activity have meet the threshold for proscription establish in the terrorism act the organisation have conduct an escalating campaign involve sustained criminal damage to national security infrastructure intimidation and alleged violence include the use of weapon result in serious injury to individual 
 weaponisation of social medium have become a real cancer in our society with mps and other be target what step be the government take on hostile state threat on social medium that might be be use to undermine our democracy 
 my hon friend be right to raise this new and emerge artificial intelligence technology have the potential to amplify threat to democracy include through hyper realistic bot which be use to spread disinformation and misinformation at speed the government be absolutely committed to address the threat include by ensure that social medium platform have the right system in place to identify and tackle harmful material that breach their term of service 
 the attorney general have claim that we need the european convention on human right and the european court to solve the illegal migration crisis an extraordinary claim will the minister please explain therefore how australia manage to tackle its migration problem and how the us be manage to implement our rwanda plan all outside the european convention that the attorney general say we need 
 the hon gentleman hear the home secretary ’s point on the convention but it be clear that gimmick such as rwanda do not work—£700 for merely volunteer to go what work be effective   processing quick decision and quick removal that be what we will get under this government and it be what we do not get from those who carp from the opposition benches 
 early this year year old harvey willgoose be murder by a fellow pupil when attend school his murderer have now be convict and a national child safeguard review panel set up but time and time again such panel make the same recommendation and we fail to implement the kind of learning and culture change that would ensure that another tragedy like this do not happen will the home secretary reassure harvey ’s family that she will ensure that those panel recommendation be implement and that we can avoid any family like harvey ’s suffer that same tragedy again 
 we offer our sympathy to the family of harvey whose death be a heartbreaking tragedy that have devastate the entire community our thought remain with his family and friend of course we recognise that pattern i have see it too in my constituency that be why we be create a child protection authority as be recommend in a previous inquiry to provide effective national oversight to ensure that lesson be learn 
 chichester city centre have see a rise in antisocial behaviour in particular by those on e bike and e scooter resident be understandably concerned about such bike which be often modify in the speed at which they can go what be the minister do to give sussex police power to identify remove and most importantly dispose of the e bike that be ride so recklessly on our street 
 that be a concern that many member in the house share the crime and policing bill will give the police power to seize vehicle be use antisocially i be happy to have a conversation with the hon lady about what more we need to do 
 last year a report by the charity justice and care highlight that a lack of regulation allow unscrupulous business owner to exploit vulnerable people nottingham trent university show that of hand car wash business operate in a way that make they high risk for forced or compulsory labour will the government consider license sector such as hand car wash to improve compliance and prevent illegal worker and modern slavery 
 in the view of the home office the most important safeguard be the right to work check that be why we will strengthen they under the border security asylum and immigration bill that be make its way through parliament but that will have to be underpin with rigorous enforcement that be why i be pleased that enforcement visit be up in the past year as be arrest 
 the definition of islamophobia by the all party parliamentary group on british muslims say that the debate about rape gang be a form of anti muslim racism among other alarming thing it say that raise concern about entryism into government by extremist which be an established tactic of the muslim brotherhood be islamophobic the home secretary endorse that   definition do she still believe that address the religion of rape gang member or identify muslim brotherhood entryism be islamophobic or do she now disown that definition 
 that definition seek to give context to pattern of behaviour let i be clear for the hon gentleman and the whole house there be absolutely no excuse for or hiding of the criminality of those who engage in heinous crime such as those involve rape or grooming gang that be why the government will take forward the casey recommendation and have that national inquiry he know that the government be work with a work group on a definition of islamophobia we have be absolutely clear that we will not pursue any measure that would impinge on our ancient right of freedom of speech 
 ensure that our town centre be safe vibrant and welcoming be hugely important in clwyd north i warmly welcome the government ’s safe street summer initiative in rhyl and colwyn bay from walkabout i have do recently with local police it be clear that a strong community police presence be crucial to tackle antisocial behaviour where it arise will the home secretary ensure that north wales police have all the resource they need all year around in rhyl denbigh abergele and colwyn bay to help build back our town centre 
 so far we have have really good feedback from over town centre that have take part in the safe street summer initiative that initiative finish at the end of september so we will have proper analysis then but it be our priority to ensure that our police have the resource they need all year round 
 when will level of shoplift finally reduce rather than rise as they have under this government 
 as we be discuss early target shoplifting be an absolute priority for this government we have a raft of intervention and we be take legislative action to protect our retail worker who have be particularly affect by a massive increase in abuse as well as a rise in crime 
 i congratulate the new team and welcome they to the government front bench a week be a long time but i have a promise to meet the previous minister to discuss the immigration system because of the challenge that the home secretary have inherit be a broken processing system as of the home office ’s large customer for my constituent i know where the gap and the problem be so i would welcome a meeting with the minister about that if the home secretary agree 
 i share my hon friend ’s important interest in that issue i would never miss a chance to meet she and i would be very glad to do so 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 i welcome member of the new government front bench team to their place the previous ministerial team have be clear that they want to stop the use of large site to house asylum seeker but there have be some indication that that position may have change will the home secretary or the minister clarify the position and confirm that if they be change that position they will learn the lesson of what go wrong previously 
 i look forward to work with the right hon lady and her committee in its important work we have make a significant commitment to the closure of asylum hotel which be crucial for public conference it be a matter of record that we be look at big site include ministry of defence site but we will of course look very closely at the history in this space to ensure that anything that we do be effective and sustain 
 i warmly welcome the home secretary and her team to their place the home secretary will be aware of the recent horrific attack and rape of a sikh woman in oldbury in my constituency who reportedly have racist abuse direct at she the case be be treat as a hate crime and a suspect be under arrest what step be the home secretary take to support west midlands police in secure justice in the case and to address the wide concern of the sikh and other ethnic minority community regard the increase of racism in the public discourse which can lead to target violence and damage community safety 
 the horror of a sexual assault motivate by race or ethnicity be absolutely appalling i be sure that the whole house will join i in condemn such crime in the strong possible term on the specific of the case it be an ongoing criminal investigation and it be imperative that we allow the justice system to do its work i urge anyone with any further information about the case to get in touch with west midlands police as soon as possible i hope that my hon friend and members across the house will have hear my comment early when i say that this government will not stand for any incitement to racial hatred or violence it be imperative and incumbent on all member of the house to ensure that we all jointly and collectively hold that line 
 in an early answer the minister refer to the increase use by police of live facial recognition while that may well have some effect on tackle crime it be be use without any legal framework and no national instruction will she say when those will be put in place 
 facial recognition be be use in a control way for high harm individual there be guidance about how it should be use but i be happy to have a further conversation with the right hon gentleman about that as i be aware that member from across the house have raise the issue of the framework within which it operate 
 i pay tribute to my former colleague for the way that they professionally police the protest over the weekend and i wish those who be injure a speedy recovery   police officer can not join a union and they have only staff association the police federation to choose from the chief executive of which reportedly take home over £ last year will the new ministerial team commit to review whether that monopoly can really serve the interest of our brave police officer 
 we need to ensure that our police officer be give the good support that they can be give through the police federation which be the vehicle by which they be support through any incident they have i will be work very closely with it to ensure that it be do the right thing on behalf of its member 
 i would not be here today without wimbledon police station in brave officer from that station save i from a murderous attack wimbledon police station be now under threat with its front counter due to close do the home secretary agree that local police station such as wimbledon ’s be critical to neighbourhood policing and community safety 
 i be very sorry to hear about the hon gentleman ’s incident that must have be absolutely terrifying we need to ensure that our neighbourhood police be responsive and be there when we need they most which be why we be target the resource we have to ensure that we have neighbourhood policing the response team must be there when we need they through any mean of get in touch with they whether it be on the phone online or in person and we need to ensure that they be there 
 when police officer up and down the country like my former colleague reach year of service they receive a long term service medal but police community support officer do not seem to receive any recognition for long service will the minister agree to look into provide similar recompense and recognition for the service that pcso provide 
 i hesitate to announce new policy in week but i certainly think there need to be some kind of recognition for our pcso who do such an incredible job across all our community 
 be the home secretary aware that of officer in the metropolitan police be currently either suspend or on restricted duty with senior officer warn that the situation be unsustainable do she agree that we need urgently to review both welfare and disciplinary process in our police service so that town such as romford can get more police actually patrol our street 
 i agree we need to ensure that resource be target in the place where we need they we have make significant reform to police standard already ensure that officer who fail background check for example be sack and that gross misconduct lead to dismissal but we need to ensure that that be right proper and appropriate and that our police be out on the street where we need they to be i be very happy to have a conversation with the hon gentleman about how these incident be be operate i will be have that conversation with the mayor and i have already have it with the commissioner 
 last week our us ally pull back from the global engagement centre their international effort to tackle cyber threat what step be the minister take to ensure that our democracy be protect from foreign interference cyber threat and misinformation 
 we take all those threat incredibly seriously we host the country ministerial meeting with our american canadian australian and kiwi ally just last week we work incredibly closely with our    partner to ensure that we be do everything we can to support uk business and to target the perpetrator of these attack 
 people in my constituency have raise with i problem of hare coursing theft speeding and fly tipping will the minister meet i to discuss how we can tackle the wide range of crime in rural area 
 i be happy to meet with the hon lady 
 before i call the minister i wish to make a brief statement i find out only this morning that the charge against the individual relate to espionage for the chinese authority be to be drop i do not think that be good of course we do not discuss the detail of security matter relate to parliament on the floor of the house but give the very important issue raise by this case i ask official to consider whether any further step should be take operational strategic or legal to ensure that all those who work in this parliament be able to undertake their activity securely and without interference i be a very unhappy speaker with what have happen the fact that it have take year until today for somebody to withdraw this case be not good enough 
 this morning the crown prosecution service decide not to proceed with the prosecution of christopher cash and christopher berry who have be charge with espionage for china under the official secrets act member right across the house will be aware that the charge relate to allegation of chinese espionage within parliament and will want reassurance as will you mr speaker many member will be as extremely disappointed as i be that there will now not be a trial 
 the decision not to proceed with this prosecution be an independent for the cps to make in its role as the uk ’s independent prosecute authority however i want to be clear that the government remain gravely concerned about the threat of chinese espionage parliament and our democracy be sacrosanct and any attempt by any foreign power to infiltrate or interfere with parliamentary proceeding be completely unacceptable with your permission mr speaker i will therefore set out the measure the government be take to tackle any residual risk arise from this case and outline the wide approach the government be take to protect our democracy and counter state threat include those from china 
 the decision of the cps relate to charge under the official secrets act which be the relevant legislation in force at the time it be well know that state threat legislation have not keep pace with the change threat we face the official secrets act be pass to counter the threat from german spy before the world war it refer to espionage as obtain 
 any sketch plan model article note document or information 
 that 
 might be useful to an enemy 
 clearly that language draft well over year ago do not reflect the type of espionage or state threat we face in the modern day nor the breadth of state that engage directly in that activity 
 for that reason the uk pass and have now commence the national security act with cross party support that legislation which replace the official secrets act bring new criminal offence and power to bear against the full range of modern day state threat moreover the national security act be state agnostic remove the unhelpful enemy language from the official secrets act and focus on the malign activity we be all concerned about 
 the act also introduce the foreign influence registration scheme which the government bring into force on   july firs encourage transparency strengthen the resilience of our democratic institution against covert influence and give our intelligence agency and law enforcement additional tool to detect deter disrupt and prosecute state threat actor it require that any foreign influence in our democracy include from china be declare we can now be confident that should case of espionage or state threat be uncover in the future we will be in a much well position to prosecute they under the new national security act 
 this case hit at the heart of our democracy so let i be clear the government will not tolerate any state threat to the uk and its democratic institution we will robustly challenge china when necessary as we would challenge any country for unacceptable behaviour on our soil i can confirm that the foreign office have démarche the chargé d’affaires of the chinese embassy in london to make clear that we will not tolerate any activity that interfere in our democracy mi5 be consider the provision of additional advice to those most at risk of be target by state lead espionage and the government be take robust action to counter state threat and continue to build up the uk ’s resilience 
 in april we establish a new cross government state threat unit to well co ordinate our response to state threat as i set out follow the recently complete review of transnational repression new training module on identify and counter state threat be be offer to all territorial police force through the college of policing and be mandatory for counter terrorism policing officer we have commit to legislate as soon as parliamentary time allow to take forward the recommendation of jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism and state threat legislation that include create a new proscription style tool for state threat 
 as the former foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for tottenham mr lammy   set out in his statement to the house follow the conclusion of the china audit we be invest £ in our intelligence service to support they in detect and disrupt state threat to the uk in september the national cyber security centre co seal a us lead technical advisory call out chinese state sponsor cyber threat actor target global network include in the uk i know there will be call to go far and i reassure the house and the country that we will keep all tool under review and act as necessary 
 as you be aware mr speaker the safety and security of our parliament be of the utmost importance that be why the national protective security authority will issue new protective security guidance to parliamentarian and political staff on protection against foreign interference and espionage that guidance outline the potential risk we all may face in our day to day work and how we can all well protect ourselves i urge colleague to read and follow the advice once issue i also urge member to take up the national cyber security centre ’s important opt in service for member of both houses it allow the ncsc to alert individual if it identify evidence of malicious activity on their personal device or account and swiftly advise they on step to take to protect their information 
 the strategic defence review be clear that china present a sophisticated and persistent challenge as the national security strategy reinforce instance of china ’s espionage interference in our democracy and undermine of our economic security have increase in recent year as i have set out we be address those threat but there be also opportunity we need to grasp as we navigate our complex relationship with china the last government do not describe china as an enemy and this government do not think our relationship can be simplify down to a single word instead we be take a consistent long term approach to china firmly rooted in the uk ’s global interest 
 i finish by pay tribute to our law enforcement security and intelligence agency who do so much to keep we all safe they operate often in secret often in the shadow and often at great personal danger but they have our endure gratitude while we be extremely disappointed with the outcome in this case the legislation it rely on have already be change should we need to go far we will not hesitate to do what be necessary to keep our country safe i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 let i start by thank the security minister for the briefing and information he provide ahead of his statement let i also join he in pay tribute to the officer in our police force and in the security service they work so hard and take personal risk to keep we safe 
 let we start with parliament ’s intelligence and security committee ’s assessment of china publish a year or ago it find that china have penetrate every sector of our economy when the security minister a moment ago say that china merely pose a challenge he be wrong i think to use that word china pose a threat it pose a threat because it participate and organise systemic espionage into our public institution include parliament it purloin intellectual property from university and from company particularly in the technology sector and it routinely spy on the uk as a state they also engage in transnational repression of chinese citizen here for instance run secret undeclared police station and put bounty on the head of individual the word challenge be not strong enough the state of china pose a threat 
 the security minister say that the government would robustly challenge china but let i gently point to some of the decision that the government have take in practice we see a signal back at the g7 last year when the prime minister be i be afraid to say obsequious in deal with president xi appear to prioritise economic link above security consideration we have not see any decision to place china in the enhance tier of the firs scheme although that regime have be in place for several month and the government seem to be view with favour the application for a new super embassy in london to which our ally include america be urge we not to consent and which many of our intelligence service say will be use as a base for espionage activity so the government ’s record on china cause deep concern but of equal concern be this specific case and mr speaker you explain why that   be of particular concern to parliament give that the alleged espionage activity touch directly on parliament and the way in which members of parliament do their duty 
 i have in front of i a briefing provide to the press by the crown prosecution service date   april when these charge be lay that briefing state that of the subject be commission over a period exceed a year between december and february by a chinese intelligence asset there be report on what this note describe as very specific topic some of which relate directly and personally to member of parliament of the deputy national security adviser tell the crown prosecution service that he assess this information to be directly or indirectly useful to the chinese state and say that it be 
 prejudicial to the safety or interest of the united kingdom 
 give the gravity of that assessment it be astonishing that these charge have now be withdraw the crown prosecution service clearly assess these allegation and the evidence against the law against the act in and find the test to have be meet so why today more than a year later have we suddenly be tell that the test be no long meet my question to the security minister be a simple give the gravity of the charge that i have just read out what have change between last year and this year why have a case that meet the threshold and meet the test in april all of a sudden be determine not to do so 
 may i ask specifically whether anyone in the government put any pressure on the crown prosecution service in relation to this case do the government co operate fully with the police the security service and the cps in provide the information require include information relate to the definition of an enemy can the security minister give the house those express assurance i certainly share your concern mr speaker and i be sure the concern of many other that what appear to be extremely serious espionage assess as such in the write disclosure that i read out assess by the deputy national security adviser as be prejudicial to our national interest have all of a sudden and with no explanation be drop even though previously just a year and a bit ago it be assess that this case do meet the threshold the house and the country need to know what exactly have change 
 let i seek to address the shadow home secretary ’s point he raise the question of whether china constitute a threat or not i think i be very clear in the language that i use as the right hon gentleman will know and as the government set out in the strategic defence review china present a sophisticated and persistent challenge the reality be that in government there be an absolute requirement to co operate with nation all around the world when there be area in which we need to challenge china of course we will do so i be sure the right hon gentleman and other opposition members will completely understand that when there be area in term of economic co operation in which we need to work closely with china of course we will do so because it be absolutely in our national interest 
 i reference the comment of the previous foreign secretary and the shadow home secretary might want to look back at what be say follow the china audit   the previous foreign secretary be absolutely crystal clear we will take a long term strategic approach to china that be root in the uk ’s national interest i understand why the shadow home secretary want to boil down such a complex bilateral relationship into a single word but the reality be that it be neither helpful nor sensible to do so 
 the shadow home secretary will not be surprised to hear that i do not agree with his characterisation of what he describe as the signal that this government have send to china in truth i will not take any lesson from he on that not least because i have say this to he previously it be not so long ago that a conservative prime minister take the leader of china to the pub when it come to signal i be not sure that the shadow home secretary speak with a huge amount of authority 
 the shadow home secretary speak about firs he know that the government ’s position be that no decision have be take with regard to the enhance tier and china and any decision take by the government will be announce in the normal way firs be a crucial tool and i be proud that this government have get on and implement it as of   july 
 the shadow home secretary specifically raise the issue of the embassy in london as i be sure other hon member will he will know that china ’s application to build a new embassy in london be go through an independent planning process a final decision on planning permission will be make in due course by the secretary of state for housing communities and local government but i can be absolutely clear in relation to firs the nature of the threat and the embassy that national security have be and will continue to be a core priority for this government throughout the process 
 the shadow home secretary ask about the cps decision i know that he understand that he be ask i about decision make by the cps that be entirely independent of government this be an independent decision make by the cps and it be not for any government minister to speculate on the reason behind it as i have say i have be crystal clear the government be extremely disappointed with the outcome in this case and we remain extremely concerned about the espionage threat pose to the united kingdom 
 i hope that the intelligence and security committee will get a good chance to dig into what have happen in this place because we be hamper in the chamber by not be able to look at sensitive issue i also hope that the minister will lend his weight to the approval of many senior member of this house prior to the last election it get as far as the last prime minister to create a committee to look at sensitive spending but also sensitive issue in the summer this government choose to reintroduce extradition arrangement with hong kong despite the application of the chinese security act give what the minister have say today how can we square both of those position 
 i hope that my hon friend know that this government hugely appreciate and respect the relationship we have with hongkongers through the process in place we will absolutely ensure that nobody be they a hongkonger or any other nationality be   extradite for reason of political expediency i can also point she to the important work which we take incredibly seriously on transnational repression i previously make a statement to this house and i hope that she and other understand the seriousness with which we take these activity we be work closely with our international ally and we be do everything we can to ensure that the uk be a hard target for these threat wherever they might originate 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as always i be very grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 for year the chinese communist party have work to undermine the democratic institution and value that underpin our society this house be all too aware of the warning not least from the intelligence and security committee ’s excoriate report on china that report make it clear that the previous government lack a coherent strategy for deal with the threat pose by the chinese state and that insufficient resource have be commit to meet that challenge we expect to see well from this government 
 we be face with a case in which man of they a parliamentary researcher with close link to senior mp be accuse of serious offence under the official secrets act only for the crown prosecution service to drop those charge due to insufficient evidence in this context the decision be deeply worrying it raise serious question about the uk ’s capacity to detect and prosecute espionage link to hostile state particularly china so what specific issue with the evidence lead the cps to conclude that the threshold for prosecution be no long meet 
 more broadly what do this outcome say about our preparedness to respond to threat from foreign intelligence service operate on our soil and even within the corridor of this parliament the government must make protect our democracy a national security priority that mean implement the recommendation of the isc ’s china report in full and ensure that we be not leave expose to foreign interference simply because our system be not equip to respond 
 finally the minister again today commit to introduce legislation for a proscription mechanism for state and state link body as soon as parliamentary time allow could he update we on the timeline for bring this forward and what its scope will be
