the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he have take with cabinet colleague to help support economic growth in scotland 
 what step he have take with cabinet colleague to help support economic growth in scotland 
 the scotland office be support the white ribbon scotland campaign which ask people to sign a pledge never to commit condone or remain silent about violence against woman i have sign it as have the under secretary of state my hon friend   the member for midlothian kirsty mcneill and i encourage scottish members from across the house to come to dover house foyer and sign the pledge themselves this government have a mission to halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade i be sure that the whole house support that 
 economic growth be our no mission in this government we announce a historic budget for scotland that choose investment over decline and an end to austerity on top of a record settlement the uk government be invest nearly £ into local growth project in scotland create the national wealth fund to support our new industrial strategy and drive the transition to clean energy via great british energy which be headquarter in aberdeen 
 the labour budget in year deliver £ for scotland in barnett consequential the big settlement since devolution put an end to austerity on top of that it confirm £ for kilmarnock in my constituency i thank the secretary of state for ensure that that funding be deliver despite the £ black hole in the public finance leave by the tories do my right hon friend agree that the last tory government make promise to scotland that they have no intention of keep 
 i thank my hon friend not only for that question but for the tenacity with which she have back kilmarnock to get more funding for her local area in the budget it be an absolute disgrace that the previous government make promise to community such as kilmarnock about fund that they never have an   intention of keep this government step in and fund those project choose investment over decline and will deliver growth and high living standard the irony be that the scottish national party vote against the large funding settlement in the history of devolution yesterday but will spend it today 
 i recently visit vector photonics in my constituency an optical and photonic centre of excellence and a successful spin out from glasgow university what role do the secretary of state believe there be for start up and spin out tech company in scotland ’s economic growth 
 i wish vector photonics well support start up and spin out tech company and the world lead scottish university that often incubate they be an important part of this government ’s steadfast commitment to economic growth it be privilege to see at hand the importance of these spin out during my recent visit to malaysia and singapore when i discuss this with the scottish university present in those country and representative from the government and business scottish university punch well above their weight internationally something we should nurture and be very proud of 
 with your indulgence mr speaker i wish peter macmahon well as he step down as scottish political editor of itv border peter have provide outstanding coverage of not just scottish question in this parliament but scottish politic more generally to my constituent and those across the south of scotland 
 i be sure the secretary of state will welcome as i do the fact that the life of torness nuclear power station have be extend that be good for energy security and for the scottish economy but give that energy be a reserved matter what more can he do to bring new nuclear development to scotland 
 i join the right hon gentleman in his tribute to peter macmahon as he step down as the political editor of itv in the borders region he and i share something closely we both have good face for radio but it be always nice to appear with peter macmahon on television this government be commit to clean power by and of course nuclear be part of that mix 
 the secretary of state will recognise that the rise in national insurance contribution will have a clear impact on economic growth whether in scotland or anywhere else in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland representative from the food sector tell i that food price will increase by between and that will impact the ordinary man and woman in the street what impact do the minister think the rise in national insurance contribution will have on economic growth 
 economic growth be the no mission of this government as the hon gentleman know when the chancellor come to the dispatch box to deliver her budget she start on minus £ that black hole leave for we by the previous government we choose investment over decline and we choose to end austerity so tough decision have to be make 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state have say before and he have say again today that of his top priority for the scotland office be growth to grow the government need confidence from business let we see how that be go the verdict from scottish business to his government ’s budget be in offshore energies uk say that 
 this be a difficult day for the sector 
 the scottish hospitality group have say 
 today ’s announcement be a blow to business across the country 
 the scotch whisky association say that the increase in spirit duty be a hammer blow the national farmers union scotland have say that the decision will cause huge difficulty and act as a barrier to those want to get into farming 
 give those response if not from retail oil and gas hospitality food and drink or financial service from which sector do he think this mythical growth will come 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place as the new shadow secretary of state for scotland and as a shadow energy minister he have something in common with   the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn the leader of the snp in this house who also aspire to have job unlike   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie i have actually run my own business so i know that run a business need stability credibility and confidence the previous government crash the economy leave it in tatter and leave business confidence at a record low we be invest for the future and business back that 
 i would take the right hon gentleman ’s response more seriously if we do not all see and indeed have just hear how damage his government ’s action be for the scottish economy national insurance increase and punitive tax rise on our most successful industry put at risk the future of family farm and the rural economy as secretary of state he would rather make performative gesture such as refuse to cross a picket line outside his department than meet scotland ’s business leader as people local authority and business await the scottish government ’s budget later today do he agree that when it come to economic incompetence scotland really do have in his government and in the proven ineptitude of the snp the very bad of all world 
 i will be correct if i be wrong but i think the hon gentleman back former prime minister liz truss who when she be prime minister crash the economy and leave a £ black hole—[interruption the hon gentleman shake his head and say that he do not but he walk through the lobby with she when she do those thing in her budget he do back former prime minister liz truss we will take no lecture from the opposition on how to run the economy or back business of course his party leave the high tax burden on work people in year another inheritance that this government will have to try to resolve 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i be sure that like   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   and myself the secretary of state for scotland be watch with bated breath for the late scottish budget after year of incompetence people be look for change in scotland and the labour party be promise it will the secretary of state follow the initiative of his scottish leader anas sarwar in say he will reinstate the winter fuel allowance and make representation to the prime minister to reconsider other policy such as the national insurance change which be create instability and uncertainty for the scottish economy 
 i have a lot of respect for the hon lady but this be another instance where the opposition party in this chamber want all the benefit of the budget but they do not want to be able to pay for it we have announce the large settlement for scotland in devolution ’s history £ which be £ extra the chancellor deliver £ extra in barnett consequential alone from this dispatch box during the budget the snp vote against it but will spend it today 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help support veteran in scotland 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help support veteran in scotland 
 this government be fully commit to deliver for veteran and i pay tribute to they and their family for the sacrifice they make during their service as well as their value contribution to our society after they leave the minister for veterans and people my hon friend   the member for birmingham selly oak al carns be lead work across government and with the scottish government to ensure veteran and their family can access all the support they need 
 there be significant variability in the provision of veteran service across the nation what step be the secretary of state taking alongside his cabinet colleague to ensure parity of service across the nation and in particular in scotland 
 the minister for veterans and people be lead this work the prime minister recently make an announcement on give veteran a social housing exemption which i can confirm will bring england in line with scotland where veteran be already exempt from the local connection requirement to access social housing we be create a level playing field across the nation to support veteran as i mention in my answer 
 since the royal british legion scotland have support veteran and their family through education remembrance and direct support this weekend   in my constituency in keighley the town council and community group be unveil a memorial to the fall of the world war with a time capsule place under the cenotaph to be open in year do the minister agree that event such as these which bring together the whole community be of vital importance for our veteran not only in keighley but in scotland and across the wide united kingdom 
 i join the hon gentleman in pay tribute to the volunteer who often run these event i also draw the house ’s attention to the work of the war memorials trust which be of the many unsung organisation that do incredible work across this country to maintain war memorial so that we all may remember across this house we have many veteran and those who have serve i pay tribute to they all and in particular to the member on the government benches who be veteran or reservist 
 last week i have the honour of attend the steel cut ceremony of hms sheffield at bae govan in my constituency add to a long list in the tradition of build high quality defence industry vessel on the clyde what assurance can the minister give i that defence procurement and skill will continue to be develop on the clyde 
 i can give my hon friend the firmest of assurance that we will continue to prioritise shipbuilding on the clyde and indeed defence job across scotland 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help improve living standard in scotland 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help improve living standard in scotland 
 our economic growth mission will raise living standard in scotland our new deal for work people will disproportionately benefit scot new protection such as guarantee hour will help shift worker with up to £ a year we be also deliver an annual pay rise of £ for hundred of thousand of full time worker in scotland and we have commit to the triple lock which mean an extra £ for pensioner next year last week we pay the instalment to former scottish miner with their full pension we will improve living standard through well public service and pay drive by economic growth 
 do the secretary of state agree that community benefit fund from wind farm contribute to improve living standard for community will he join i in praise the work of the community council group in ayr carrick and cumnock as a model of the fair distribution of fund to support local apprenticeship and improve living standard across the cumnock and doon valley area 
 i congratulate not only the community council in my hon friend ’s area on their initiative but community council up and down the country that do so much work on our behalf to ensure that the community benefit fund derive from local wind farm make a tangible difference to local people i congratulate she on stand up consistently for her community our mission be to become a clean energy superpower by and our community will be at the heart of that community must benefit from host national infrastructure for clean power that be why right hon friend the secretary of state for energy security and net be develop guidance on community benefit which will be publish in due course 
 some scot be on hour contract with no guarantee of secure hour labour ’s employment rights bill will address that do the secretary of state agree that scot be in insecure work be a damn indictment of the state the tories leave our economy in and show that we need a new direction in holyrood 
 mr speaker you will not be surprised to hear that i absolutely agree with my hon friend interruption absolutely shocked the government inherit not just a fiscal crisis from the previous government but an industrial too we need more high quality job in scotland between our industrial strategy our plan to get scotland work and the employment right legislation we will help to deliver that do not forget that the snp government say that hour contract be a positive destination for work our plan to make work pay will have a big positive benefit in scotland than in the rest of the uk that be the difference in have scottish labour mps on the government benches 
 i join the secretary of state for scotland in welcome the shadow secretary of state for scotland to his place i congratulate he on his appointment it do make it difficult sometimes to tell the of they apart that be say especially on day like today today the scottish government will continue to protect the most vulnerable in society from the excess of westminster cut instead of tory cut it will be labour cut to winter fuel payment do the secretary of state agree with the cut to the winter fuel allowance 
 mr speaker i be sorry for such a short response to the hon gentleman but there be reason why that question be rubbish 
 i have to say i be not surprised there be huge confusion in the labour party about the winter fuel allowance the scottish government be do something about it the uk government be not the secretary of state do not even know the number of pensioner who would be affect by the winter fuel cut labour be now distance itself from labour vote labour to stop labour be that the message his party be send out or should voter just vote for the party that be actually do something about it 
 i think what the hon gentleman be tend to forget be that the winter fuel payment in scotland be devolve it be the snp scottish government   who decide to mean test it as well if it be not for the £ extra deliver by our labour chancellor at this dispatch box to end austerity which the scottish government will spend today they would not be able to make any decision whatsoever 
 what step he be take to support the regeneration of scottish town centre 
 i commend the hon lady for her work with the chancellor to help to deliver a record budget settlement for scotland the large scottish government budget settlement in the history of devolution it be now up to the scottish government to ensure that our town feel the benefit of it there can be no more excuse from the scottish national party the budget also confirm nearly £ of funding for local growth project and we be deliver growth deal in all part of scotland many of which be improve town centre and other community asset 
 hamilton be a brilliant place in which to live and work but the board up shop in quarry street tell a story of their own what can this government do to support business across hamilton and clyde valley and across scotland which have suffer so badly under the chaos and neglect of government conservative and snp 
 my hon friend be entirely correct and i commend she for stand up for her town in england this labour government have already deliver low business rate for leisure hospitality and retail business which can help high street and i be sure that every scottish mp want to see that policy replicate in scotland 
 as we be discuss brilliant town it be timely to mention brilliant retail worker too especially at this time of year i be support the christmas campaign organise by the scottish retail consortium and the union of shop distributive and allied workers to encourage everyone to respect our shop worker at this particularly busy time of year 
 for far too long ullapool in my constituency do not have a post office which cause great inconvenience to local people recently however tesco step into the breach and we now have a highly successful post office in a branch in the middle of ullapool may i recommend this approach to regenerate town centre to the ministers 
 we be delighted to receive representation of all kind on how to improve our town centre we know that they have suffer neglect for far too long i hope that all scottish mps will have be lobby for the kind of support for our leisure hospitality and retail sector that this government have already give south of the border 
 what step he be take to improve transport connectivity between scotland and england 
 may i pay tribute to the hon gentleman my predecessor i know that he will continue to represent his constituent assiduously from the back benches both the secretary of state and i will be work closely with the department for transport and the scottish government to ensure that cross border connectivity remain a top priority for this government 
 extend the borders railway line to hawick and newcastleton and then on to carlisle will boost job help the local economy and improve social mobility the funding for the feasibility study be agree by the last conservative government with the snp administration in edinburgh but the new labour government seem to have push this into the railway siding will the minister ensure that the funding for the feasibility study be release as soon as possible 
 the uk government be fully commit to the borderlands growth deal it will deliver economic growth for the south of scotland and beyond which be of our key mission the scotland office continue to work with the department for transport the scottish government and borderlands partner on the next stage of business case development for the tweedbank carlisle corridor and on feasibility option for the extension of the borders railway line unfortunately it be ultimately up to transport scotland and the scottish government to follow through on the delivery of this important project 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i echo the minister ’s word about her predecessor and indeed my own predecessor as shadow secretary of state and the work that he have do 
 of the last government ’s decision of which i be most proud be the halving of air passenger duty which lead to cheap flight and increase route across the uk however with airline already cut back on route as a result of this government ’s decision to hike apd people who do not live within a few hour of london on the train such as those in aberdeen face high fare and few option for travel how can the government credibly claim to support well transport connectivity across the united kingdom when those live outside the central belt i know that labour member need to be remind that it exist be be punish 
 as the hon gentleman will know we face a climate emergency and indeed an economic emergency of his government ’s own making we be face in our few month in government with a £ black hole with treasury reserve spend time over we have take tough choice to try to deal with the economic inheritance that we receive 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the autumn budget 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the autumn budget 
 we have reset the relationship with the scottish government and i have meet the deputy minister numerous time to discuss the autumn budget and other issue between the moment when my right hon friend the chancellor stand up and the moment when she sit down scotland be well off to the tune of £ in barnett consequential alone again money that the snp vote against but will spend today i encourage the scottish government to use that money to strengthen frontline service bring down nhs waiting time and lift attainment in our school there can be no more excuse we end austerity and it be time that they follow 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer a thrive retail hospitality and leisure sector be critical to brand scotland follow the welcome decision in the budget to ensure a rate relief for rhl business in england what guarantee if any have my right hon friend have from the scottish government that the extra barnett consequential link to non domestic rate will be pass on in today ’s scottish budget do he agree that any failure to do so would be deeply damaging to the sector 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he be absolutely correct the uk budget choose investment over decline include investment directly in my hon friend ’s constituency as part of the £ town fund as well as the big budget settlement in the history of devolution he be also right to say that our hospitality business need the rate relief more than ever the scottish government should use their budget to deliver growth and investment to help our high street and pass on the relief should be the bare minimum 
 we have deliver the big budget settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution with as the house have hear today more than £ of extra funding that can go towards public service do the secretary of state agree that there be no more excuse for the snp and that scot expect and deserve delivery and improvement of our public service 
 of course i could not agree more it be not just the £ but all the other investment that the uk government make outside the barnett consequential the labour government have deliver billion of pound more for school and hospital in scotland it be more money than ever before but the snp mps vote against it they vote to deny holyrood its big ever budget settlement by vote against the finance bill last week but of course they will happily spend it in their budget today they also vote against great british energy which will be base in the snp   leader ’s own constituency give what we have read about the snp ’s selection process i guess the snp mp be keener to send themselves to holyrood than billion of pound of extra funding 
 i be sure that pensioner in the secretary of state ’s constituency be as relieve as those in argyll bute and south lochaber that the scottish government ’s budget will introduce a pension age winter heating payment for all scottish pensioner the snp government be do the right thing by scottish pensioner will he join i in urge the labour government here in westminster to do the right thing by pensioner in england and wales and give they back their winter fuel allowance as well 
 what the hon gentleman have just prove be that the winter fuel payment in scotland be actually devolve 
 of the consequence of the budget be to remove £ of regeneration funding for perth city centre we get practically nothing from the levelling up fund save for that paltry £ which the secretary of state be take away just what be it that the uk government have against the city of perth 
 no project have be cancel the perth deal be under consideration by the ministry of housing communities and local government and the treasury it have not be cancel it have merely be pause the hon gentleman should speak to his colleague in the scottish government who have £ extra in barnett consequential to spend today perhaps he could even have a chat with some of his colleague sit next to he who seem happy in holyrood than they be here 
 what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on the potential impact of propose change to employer national insurance contribution on hospice in scotland 
 i know there be consensus right across this house on the enormous value of the hospice sector and the extraordinary work that it do work that sadly have be undervalue for far too long support for additional employer national insurance contribution will be allocate to departments with the barnett formula apply in the usual way for the devolved government the rise do not begin until april and we will set out further detail on the allocation of funding in due course 
 there be hospice in scotland i can not be certain of that figure because so many of they be in dire financial circumstance i think of roxburghe house in aberdeen which provide service to my constituent and those of other mp in this chamber another organisation that provide vital hospice care be the marie curie charity which provide service in edinburgh and glasgow it also provide hospice at home care the charity be face a bill close to £ as a   result of decision make by this government what do the minister have to say about the help that can be provide to marie curie and other organisation 
 as the hon gentleman will know the pressure on hospice funding long predate the budget and relate to the decline in real term funding from the scottish government i note that nearly member of the public have write to the scottish government recently to support call from the scottish hospice leadership for fair funding those call might be answer this afternoon when the snp government will have an extra £ to spend this be secure by scottish labour mps but vote against by snp mps it will be spend this afternoon by snp ministers make it make sense 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday december 
 order what be those member play at that be absolutely disgraceful we have start pmq either come in early or at least wait please start read the room 
 it be a pleasure to welcome his highness the amir of the state of qatar to the uk i look forward to discussion this afternoon on how we be strengthen our relationship and boost trade and investment include an announcement today of a £ investment in our new clean energy partnership 
 sunday mark world aids day and we stand with all those we have lose and those live with hiv today we will seek to end new case of hiv in england by 
 i also note that we be join in the gallery today by mandy damari the mother of emily a british citizen still be hold hostage in gaza i have meet mandy a number of time and in my view what she be go through be nothing short of torture 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i would like to concur with the comment the prime minister have just make north devon district hospital be the most remote hospital in mainland england its intensive care unit have only bed it be almost year old and it serve a population of people can the prime minister assure my constituent that their hospital will receive the urgent funding that be need under the new hospital programme so that they will not face a more than hour drive to the near trauma unit 
 the new hospital programme that we inherit be emblematic of the failure of the previous government make promise with no plan to deliver on they we be commit to delivery   include the north devon hospital we be review the programme to place it on a sustainable footing and the health secretary will set out further detail of the new delivery soon in the meantime we continue to support trust to develop their scheme 
 i welcome the swift and decisive action this government be take to secure our border after the conservatives lose control in particular i welcome the world deal strike with iraq last week to tackle smuggling gang do the prime minister agree that international co operation shared intelligence and joint law enforcement be the good way to end the vile smuggling trade 
 i thank my hon friend she be a superb champion for her constituent and she be absolutely right the previous government leave a broken asylum system we have put a plan in place the border security command back by £ more national crime agency officer and we be introduce counter terror style power my hon friend be right to say that our new international co ordination include the landmark iraq agreement the hard graft be already begin to pay off because people who have no right to be here have be return that be a increase on the number of last year the conservatives promise to get the flight off the ground we have get they off the ground 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i pay tribute to mandy damari and her family for the strength they have show we on this side of the house and i be sure the whole house continue to seek the speedy release of emily damari and the other hostage 
 the prime minister talk about immigration so it be probably a good time to remind he that he be the write letter ask we not to deport foreign criminal he and his party vote against every single measure we put in place to try to limit immigration the question today be what have be on the lip of all labour mp include i believe the health secretary yesterday the prime minister knowingly appoint a convict fraudster to be his transport secretary what be he think 
 the previous transport secretary be right to resign when further information come forward what a marked contrast to the behaviour of the last year the leader of the opposition talk about immigration there be record level of immigration under the previous government with net migration of nearly and she be the cheerleader she be the urge the removal of the cap on work visa she thank the previous home secretary for the work that be do she champion it she advocate it record level of immigration 
 he be obfuscate but i be go to keep he on the topic he owe the house an explanation he say that the former transport secretary be ask to resign only after further information come to light what be that further information 
 i be not go to disclose private conversation further information come to light and the transport secretary resign what a marked contrast while the right hon lady be obsess with westminster issue we be get on with fix the mess and fix the foundation with that £ black hole our prison burst and as we find out last week net migration of nearly because of the tory open border policy 
 i be not ask about migration i be ask about the former transport secretary he never answer any question and it look like he do not ask his transport secretary any question either the truth be that he appoint a person convict of fraud to the cabinet and the thing she do be bung hundred of million of pound in pay rise to her trade union friend be this not a fraud on the british people 
 no she say she be not talk about immigration and i be not surprised i advise she not to talk about the economy or immigration for another year 
 he can try to change the topic as much as he like but the public be watch he owe they an explanation the country need conviction politician not politician with conviction 
 now on to an even big fraud the budget last week the prime minister fail to repeat the chancellor ’s pledge of no more borrowing and no more taxis it be obvious that they be come back for more in his manifesto he commit to make britain the fast grow economy in the g7 do he stand by his own pledge 
 i gently remind the right hon lady that of her predecessor have conviction for break the covid rule i also invite she to look at this morning ’s oecd report which have upgrade growth for next year and the year after put we on target to be the fast grow major economy in europe in the next year she should welcome that 
 i have see the oecd report and what it say be that they will be come back for more taxis the whole house will have hear he fail to repeat his own pledge he can not even repeat the pledge he make just a few week ago we be here to stop he damage the economy and that be why—[interruption 
 order i want to hear the question 
 they be laugh the same way they all laugh during the budget when they talk about raise national insurance they have no idea what people out there be deal with that be why yesterday we vote against his damaging job tax 
 even former supporter such as the chef tom kerridge who endorse labour at the election say that the budget be catastrophic he build a real business employ young people unlike this cabinet of trade union stooge cv embellisher and an actual fraudster none of they have ever run a business why will the prime minister not listen to business who be say his budget be catastrophic 
 i think the scripted joke be over but we have another and then lecture about the economy from the conservative party that break the economy send mortgage through the roof and leave a £ black hole the right hon lady talk about national insurance she complain about the rise in national insurance week after week but then week ago she say that she would not reverse it she sign trade deal that have farmer protest in whitehall but now she pretend that she be their champion she campaign to remove the cap on migrant worker visa but now she pretend she be furious about the open border policy of the last government 
 the fact be that the prime minister have discard his own labour leadership promise he have drop the mission he say would define his government he have ditch his pledge to make britain the fast grow economy in the g7 we leave office with the uk as the fast grow economy in the g7 and business be say he have damage the economy with his budget tomorrow he be go to have an emergency reset just month into his premiership but why should anyone believe a word he say 
 the only relaunch on the conservative benches be the leadership bid of the right hon lady ’s rival she obviously have not read the oecd report publish this morning the fast growth in the next year of any major economy in europe we be proud of that opposition members should never be allow to forget the damage they do to our country they use britain like some sort of mad scientist ’s experiment open border unfunded tax cut a neglect health service and now all the madness be still come out but they say they should be back in office they have not listen they have not learn and they certainly have not change there be only party that be drive this country forward and that be this labour government 
 today it be question but who know next week i could be no in the chart as the mp this year to bring out a christmas single will the prime minister join i in thank my musical collaborator the hugely talented mal pope and everyone involve with this year ’s everyone deserve hamper campaign which will deliver festive food to home across constituency in south wales like our song say there ’ a reason for the season and everyone deserve a christmas 
 i thank my hon friend for her christmas single there be obviously go to be some rivalry in the race for no by christmas i will not be join that particular race i thank she and mal pope for their campaigning i remember join she a few summer ago in the work involve the hamper which be much need by her constituent i know how much it mean to they christmas be a time to think of other and i pay tribute to she and all those support those in need this government will always support the most vulnerable in our society 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i for will be download the song by   the hon member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris and i join the prime minister in his delight about it i also join he in support for mandy damari and our joint hope that we will see emily and other hostage release as soon as possible 
 the prime minister have rightly speak about the need to restore and rebuild the public ’s trust in british politic we believe a crucial part of that be reform our electoral system to make it fair and more proportional and so do a majority of the british public this house vote yesterday in favour of a bill for electoral reform put forward by my hon friend   the member for richmond park sarah olney will the prime minister make government time available so we can consider that bill about electoral reform and restore the public ’s trust in our politic 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for reference emily it be important that we all remember she and the awful torture that her mother be go through as be the case for all the other hostage it be hard to imagine what it must be like for anybody with friend or family who be still be hold hostage after all this time 
 proportional representation be not our policy and we will not be make time for it i will just gently say to the right hon gentleman that he do not do too badly under the system as it be 
 i be disappoint in that reply and hope that the prime minister will reflect on labour ’s policy 
 move on to another press subject more than people have be stick on nhs waiting list for more than week that be probably the bad most appalling legacy of the last conservative government and it need to be fix do the prime minister accept that we will only get waiting list down and keep they down if it be easy for everyone to see a gp when they need it when he publish his milestone tomorrow will he include a guarantee with a timetable so that people will be able to see a gp within at least day or hour if it be urgent 
 the right hon gentleman be right to draw attention to the record of the last government on the nhs record waiting list and record low confidence in the nhs in addition to the economy and immigration they have well not be talk about that for the last year either 
 we will be drive that down we have already begin that work to make sure that we get those waiting list down and yes of course that include make sure there be well access to gps and other measure that need to be take that be a central drive mission of this government 
 give that a significant number of member of this place be regardless of class woman of a certain age do the prime minister agree that when a woman of a certain age or indeed any woman of any age and from any background say that they have experience sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour they should be listen to and support and the perpetrator deal with 
 i certainly agree with that and i think everybody across the house would my hon friend be right because of the great barrier that woman face when come forward to report unacceptable behaviour in the workplace be have confidence that they will be take seriously that require all of we to put in place mechanism and arrangement to make that possible everybody should be treat with dignity and respect and i be proud of the fact that our employment rights bill will strengthen protection from sexual harassment at work 
 friday the be a date associate with bad thing happen next friday the european union ’s general product safety regulation will apply in northern ireland create more cost and bureaucracy for english scottish and welsh company that want to do business in northern ireland and northern ireland consumer buy from they many business have already stop supply northern ireland haulage company be unsure of what be require of they online sale platform be divide on the advice they give a previous prime minister promise northern ireland business that if they be ask to complete additional paperwork they should phone he and he would 
 direct they to throw that form in the bin 
 what direct tangible advice can the prime minister give to those business that want to continue supply northern ireland 
 that be a serious issue and the government be work closely with business to ensure that they be ready for the change that the hon gentleman have identify we publish more guidance yesterday as he know to support they far we will be keep a close eye on the issue to help business trade freely across the whole of the united kingdom

 today be the scottish budget which contain provision to reinstate the winter fuel payment for all scottish pensioner something that the prime minister famously take away from nearly all uk pensioner support by scottish labour members of parliament but apparently scottish labour be now in favour of the winter fuel payment so what be his advice   to labour msp be it to vote for the budget to ensure that scottish pensioner get that single fuel payment or be to stick with his view and vote that budget down

 veteran anne puckridge be in the gallery and i urge the prime minister to meet she to talk about her frozen pension yesterday the report that scottish labour mp be very upset apparently that upset be cause by their scottish leader ’s diktat that they now have to support the very winter fuel payment that they vote against in this place as the prime minister comfort his upset mps will he remind they that the only people with the right to be upset be the scottish pensioner who be leave in the cold by labour ’s cut 
 i work very closely with scottish labour in a harmonious way we run a fantastic campaign early this year which be why the hon lady be sit on the benches at the back not the benches at the front 
 i echo the word of member across the house about mandy damari who i also meet this week and who be from beckenham 
 yesterday mark international day of persons with disability and i be proud to be of the disabled mps in this house as a former i become of the young people in britain to have a hip replacement and i rely on a blue badge datum release yesterday show that blue badge theft have more than quadruple in the past year will the prime minister back my campaign to tackle blue badge theft and ensure that million of disabled people can work socialise and live an independent life 
 i thank my hon friend for be a powerful voice for some of the most vulnerable in our society theft of a blue badge be appalling deprive people of their independence and ability to travel with confidence it have a real human impact every single time that be why we be work closely with local authority to help they tackle fraud and misuse and i will make sure that my hon friend have a meeting with the relevant minister to examine what more can be do

 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue because waiting list in scotland be appalling that be why we make the argument that now that the scottish government have the money and the resource there be no more excuse for poor delivery 
 on a point of order mr speaker i seek your advice on yesterday ’s debate about a job tax on work people who be not work people it depend on the definition of work people the exchequer secretary to the treasury claim that the office for budget responsibility state there be a cover up by the previous government in column of hansard we see the word use by the minister he say that the obr use the word cover up not once but twice i have since check with the obr it have not say this i believe it be a creative use of word to suit a political narrative could you advise i on how i could bring the minister to the house to correct the record 
 if no on the government front bench want to i will deal with this i be grateful to the hon member for give notice of the point of order i understand that he have notify the exchequer secretary that he intend to refer to this matter in the chamber and i thank he for do that the chair be not responsible for what minister say in the chamber that have historically be the case however he certainly have put the record straight in his view and i be sure that those on the treasury bench will have note his remark and will reflect on they let i put it that way 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to provide that where a public body collect datum about ethnicity for the purpose of deliver public service it must include specific sikh and jewish category as option for a person ’s ethnic group and for connected purpose 
 jews and sikhs be in the unique position of be consider both ethnic and religious group under the equality act sikhs and jews have be legally recognise as ethnic group for over year since the mandla v. dowell lee case in the bill would address a fundamental absurdity in the fight against discrimination and inequality which be that we have not collect ethnicity datum on sikhs and jews since law on racial discrimination be introduce nearly year ago 
 the women and equalities committee be tell in february that the government ’s race disparity audit have identify around dataset across government but find no datum on sikhs the only datum collect on sikhs and jews in more recent year be religious datum however the quality of datum collect by public body on religion as oppose to ethnicity be poor patchy and incomplete religion datum be never use by public body to make decision for the purpose of deliver public service this make both jews and sikhs invisible to policymaker ignore the inequality and discrimination that both group face that be why a specific jewish and sikh ethnic category be need and that be what this bill will create 
 this be a campaign to end the discrimination that both community face i campaign for a sikh and jewish ethnicity tick box to be include in the census because we know that for over year public body have be instruct to use the census ’s ethnic group question to design and deliver service in compliance with equality legislation give that we be talk about protect characteristic we would expect public body to be instruct to routinely collect information on sikhs and jews but they be not 
 the then minister with responsibility for equality   the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew write this to i last year 
 public body and decision maker who think that their decision may affect discrimination harassment or victimisation of sikhs should ensure that their compliance with the duty include consideration of sikh ethnicity 
 however they do not because people incorrectly argue and assume that datum collect on religion be a suitable substitute those people do not understand existing practice religion datum be rarely collect to a good standard it exclude non practise sikhs and jews and it be not use by public body to monitor and reduce inequality or provide public service the latter be key to this argument because sikhs and jews be miss from whole swathe of public datum on education housing crime health criminal justice the public sector workforce and the ethnicity pay gap 
 the bill would allow public body to start systematically collect datum on sikhs and jews to address the discrimination and inequality that they face which be especially relevant as the government have make a commitment to require ethnicity pay gap reporting in present this bill i have the support of a wide range of community organisation include the sikh council uk gurdwara and organisation the board of deputies of british jews the antisemitism policy trust and the community security trust 
 i would like to provide the house with a few example of why this bill be so important the pandemic shine a harsh light on the inequality between different ethnic group many expert in public health now accept that we be too slow to recognise that some ethnic group be die at a far high rate than other the office for national statistics belatedly start analyse covid relate death datum by religious group where datum be available a short term exercise that have since be discontinue it find that sikhs die disproportionately from covid even after adjust for region population density area deprivation household composition socioeconomic status and a range of other economic indicator not only that but it show that sikhs be affect at a very different rate from other predominantly south asian group mean that analysis use the exist ethnic minority category would fail to capture any of these inequality 
 the board of deputies of british jews have also recognise these argument british jews die at almost twice the rate of the rest of the population as there be a high prevalence of certain genetic condition among jewish people for example of breast cancer in ashkenazi jewish woman collect well datum will help public service to profile and respond to the community well to address health inequality we need to learn from the pandemic and we need to collect accurate datum to ensure well outcome for both these community base on evidence 
 to give just example that highlight the absurdity of this system nhs blood and transplant do not collect datum on sikh organ donor or sikhs require an organ transplant despite the fact that for more than a decade there have be a policy of encourage more sikhs to become donor nhs blood and transplant do not gather the single most important datum point that would allow we to improve sign up rate among this under represent group it be shocking 
 as amanda bowman vice president of the board of deputies of british jews write last year 
 imagine you ’re sit in a hospital waiting room and have be ask to fill out a form which among other question ask for your ethnicity so which box do i tick 
 as david baddiel the author of jews do n’t count have say 
 it be othere and alienate 
 that jews do not have a distinct ethnic box to reflect their race 
 since   october the british jewish community have face an appalling rise in antisemitic hate attack while the home office collect datum on religiously motivate antisemitic hate crime it do not do so on racially aggravate antisemitism that be despite instance of racial hate crime outnumbering instance of religiously aggravate hate crime by to there be a serious   risk that jewish hate crime be be undercounte by the home office because it do not have its own jewish ethnic category 
 in the half of this year the community security trust find that the majority of antisemitic incident that it record consist of anti jewish discourse link the victim 
 to israel palestine the hamas terror attack or the subsequent war 
 accord to crown prosecution service prosecution guidance hate target someone ’ real or perceive nationality or national origin such as a link to israel would indicate a racially not religiously aggravate offence 
 the same go for sikhs as be document in the all party group on british sikhs report on anti sikh hate sikh be the most visible minority in britain yet we do not collect datum on racist anti sikh hate the last government ’s hate crime action plan effectively ignore sikh hate or the need to define anti sikh hate herein lie the fundamental problem with focus on datum relate to religion rather than ethnicity when it come to sikhs and jews religion be not a mandatory field in crime reporting standard that the home office set for police force apart from in religiously aggravate hate crime case however police force be require to record ethnicity or use ethnic appearance code that relate to census category that do not include sikhs and jews despite their recognition in the equality act his majesty ’s inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service have produce at least report since criticise police force for the poor recording of datum on the ethnicity of victim of crime 
 let i give a final example in october the chief executive of the uk jewish film festival warn of the 
 erasure of british jewish culture from national cultural life 
 by art body which be of course largely publicly fund benjamin till a composer who have be nominate for a british academy of film and television arts award tell the jewish chronicle that arts council england 
 do not allow jewish people to identify as anything other than a religion 
 he insist that arts council england 
 must accept that jewishness be a cultural and an ethnic identity 
 as the all party group on british sikhs and the board of deputies of british jews have warn even on its own merit use religious question to capture datum on our community will increasingly become irrelevant the percentage of sikhs and jews who identify with their ethnic group but do not practise their religion be grow as britain become increasingly secular we be fail to recognise the other way in which british sikhs and jews face discrimination ethnicity datum can capture that in way that religion datum do not as the board of deputies of british jews have say 
 we be concerned that until this situation be rectify many jewish citizen will not feel fully count 
 a former cabinet member for public health and protection on sandwell council say that sikhs and jews be forget when it come to the design of service because there be no ethnicity datum on jews and sikhs to inform those decision 
 in the rare case where we do have some datum it expose glare inequality in of death of homeless people in london be of sikhs who be of london ’s general population and of sikhs in the uk report that someone in their family have an alcohol addiction good quality datum save life 
 in the past few year the office for national statistics have come to acknowledge the need to ensure that the ethnicity standard reflect the diversity of the uk population that surely mean it be time to address the injustice face sikh and jewish people whatever the future of ethnicity datum collection we must routinely be include in our own right if we consider our legal status as ethnic group we should be include if we consider the size of our population we should be include if we consider our contribution to great britain and society we should be include if we consider the specific form of discrimination and the inequality we face we should be include 
 our community be ask for fairness and justice and to be count as ethnic group give that we have be recognise as such in law for more than year as david baddiel have argue 
 identify antisemitism as religious intolerance rather than racism downgrade its importance which be what lead to jews not count 
 the same go for sikhs and it be not just a rhetorical point it be literally the case that regard sikhs and jews as a religious category mean we be not count we be not count when we fill in a form in an nhs waiting room we be not count in the census and local council do not count we in the datum they use to monitor and deliver service it be high time that change so i urge member across the house to allow this bill to progress today it be high time that public body end this injustice and as legislator we must put right this wrong and support they in do that 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that preet kaur gill ben coleman jas athwal jon pearce david pinto duschinsky joani reid and alex sobel present the bill 
 preet kaur gill accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday march and to be print bill 
 i inform the house that i have select amendment a in the name of the prime minister 
 i beg to move 
 that this house regret that the government have undo its promise to farmer and be seek to punish they with inheritance tax bill of hundred of thousand or even million of pound by cut agricultural property relief and business property relief far regret that the government have provide conflict information on the number of farm that will be affect and have not conduct an impact assessment of this approach note that figure from the national farmers union suggest that some quarter of farm will be affect further note that farmer tend to be asset rich but cash poor and that figure from the country land and business association suggest the average arable farm will have to sell of its land to pay the inheritance tax bill that this policy will cause note that the central association of agricultural valuers anticipate that this will affect owner of farming business over a generation note also that this land be not guarantee to be use for food production if sell and call on the government not to impose the cut to agricultural property relief and business property relief set out in the budget that will lead to the end of family farming as it have be know for many generation in the uk 
 this government have drive farmer to despair the hike in national insurance the acceleration of delinked payment the fertiliser tax the double cab tax the stalling of capital grant the scrapping of the rural service delivery grant and the slowing down of application to farming scheme be all conspire against our rural economy and the survival of british farm yet the government have add a death tax to that the family farm tax which be see family across the united kingdom worry about whether they will be able to hand on their farm to their child as generation before they have do 
 in the day since labour ’s budget the chancellor the secretary of state and ministers have try to justify their family farm tax which will break up family farm by claim that only farm will be affect each year awkwardly the figure use by the chancellor be contradict by figure produce by the department for environment food and rural affairs the left hand do not know what the far left hand be do when the figure be query by the national farmers union the country land and business association the tenant farmers association farmer across the united kingdom and we conservatives ministers tell we all rather patronisingly that we do not understand and that farmer should seek professional advice well farmer have seek professional advice which have reveal just how badly wrong the non economist chancellor have get her number 
 will the shadow minister give way 
 in a moment 
 since the budget the central association of agricultural valuers have analyse the family farm tax and apply tax law and the reality of modern day farming to it its analysis have reveal that up to individual owner of farming business could be affect over the come generation even before inflation which be the equivalent of time the government ’s figure of farm affect in how could they have get this so wrong it be because this city dwelling chancellor secretary of state and exchequer secretary do not understand modern farming or the countryside that they have overlook a major area of tax policy and forget to consider thousand of farmer 
 as the exchequer secretary have confirm the government forget to include of the route to the relief in their calculation they have not include business property relief only claim in their figure which mean that as many as tenant farmer who can not claim agricultural property relief because they do not own the land on which they farm be absent from their calculation what be bad be that minister do not know how many farmer be affect by that 
 the city dwell chancellor and secretary of state have also forget about the farmer who in year go by follow professional advice and transfer their farm into company or partnership those farmer will claim only bpr so they have be leave out of the calculation again minister do not know how many farmer be in that position 
 will the right hon member give way 
 i will in a minute 
 i be tell by adviser that some farmer choose to use bpr only because it be easy in probate guess what yet again minister do not know how many farm be in that position and they have not be include 
 i will give way to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   and then to   the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume i have so much more to say 
 i commend the shadow minister for bring forward the debate the collective decision to have this debate in the house be that my farmer and constituent very much support professional legal advice seek through the ulster farmers union i must declare an interest as a member of the union indicate that somewhere in the region of of small farmer and family farm in northern ireland will be affect when it come to understand that have labour really get no idea what be go on 
 i thank the hon gentleman for intervene the evidence be build again and again against the assurance that the chancellor the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the exchequer secretary and the farming minister have give the house frankly the farmer outside deserve well and so do we as member of parliament 
 i will give way to the hon lady and then carry on with the calculation that the government have get so wrong 
 the right hon member leave a trail of destruction across the government she be the health secretary who break the nhs the prisons minister who run out of prison place and the treasury minister who crash the economy no wonder her constituency majority crash from to interruption do she not think it be time to apologise and for once to support the government who be bring back stability to the british economy and farmer profitability 
 order i know that member be jeer about reading i know that when i come to the house it be a rule that you should not read but both side be do it remember that 
 rise 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 i have a point of order from the shadow minister ’s good friend of course 
 this point of order be spontaneous unlike that intervention interruption i be mr spontaneity 
 mr speaker you be entirely right that many right hon and hon member read their speech almost verbatim but surely it be just rude and discourteous to the house for   the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume   to read a supposedly spontaneous intervention as if it have just come into her mind she manage to find a typewriter and a printer in order to write down page of intervention 
 as i expect spontaneity do not make it a point of order 
 as the female prime minister say if they be go after you personally it mean you be win the argument 
 let i help the hon member for scarborough and whitby with the set of calculation that her chancellor have get so wrong because the chancellor ’s cockeye accounting extend to the claim that farmer will be able to transfer £ tax free that be wrong only a few in a specific set of circumstance will be able to claim that magic figure interruption there be jeer from government members but that amount be not available to widow it be not available to people who be single and it be not available to people who own a farm with another relative labour ’s magic £ figure assume that the surviving spouse live some sort of monastic existence where they have no personal effect to pass on to their loved one as farmer from sussex have ask why be widow family be target 
 a family write to i about their mother who be a widow they have calculate that they face an additional £ tax bill from labour because their father die before the budget and so do not know to transfer his allowance 
 we know that some labour members of parliament have concern   the hon member for south west norfolk terry jermy who represent over farm i do not know whether he be in his place have ask for assurance   on the accuracy of figure use by the government give the demolition of the chancellor ’s figure by the caav and many other will he vote for the family farm in his constituency or will he toe the party line 
 the caav ’s concern about the figure be peddle by the government be share by the institute for fiscal studies cbi economics and even the office for budget responsibility but it be not just about the number labour member need to understand the emotional toll of this terrible tax it be the worry the distress and the sense of betrayal feel by family that should stop ambitious labour mp in their track before they parrot without question the figure give to they by their ministers 
 rise 
 i will give way to the hon lady i hope that she do not fall into the category that i just describe 
 the right hon lady talk about the figure do she accept that her government ’s record be of leave £ of the farming budget unspent in the treasury coffer not help farmer 
 i thank the hon lady sincerely for raise that point because she have perhaps unwittingly identify a contradiction in defra ’s own claim it talk about a £ underspend but last week it be cancel the very capital grant that farmer around the country have be invest in say that it have run out of money well it can not be both perhaps that be yet another example of the cockeyed accounting of the chancellor and the environment secretary 
 do my right hon friend agree that what be quite frightening about this policy be that perhaps the government know exactly what they be do and that a bit like animal farm they think everything should be collectivise 
 my right hon friend who have a wonderful way with word ask a question that many member of rural community up and down the united kingdom be ask themselves in fact when the prime minister do regional medium a couple of week ago sean dunderdale the wonderful presenter on bbc radio lincolnshire ask he what he have get against the people of lincolnshire i might ask what have this labour government get against the countryside 
 rise 
 i will give way to my right hon friend and neighbour and then i will make some progress 
 as my right hon friend have say the word betrayal be fitting because long before the election pledge be give by both the secretary of state and the prime minister that these change would not be make 
 order the right hon member be a very experienced member of this house and he know that he be mean to address the chair not the front bench 
 mr speaker i know that you as a man of integrity and honour will be as disappointed as i be that the government should promise thing and then do the exact opposite 
 it be a great pleasure to have the right hon gentleman not just as a friend but as my lincolnshire neighbour he have put his finger on the point genuinely it be the next paragraph in my speech 
 some labour mp must be haunt by the phrasing from the secretary of state during the general election campaign because i suspect that they repeat it up and down the market town and village in their constituency when he describe fear that labour would impose this family farm tax as desperate nonsense labour candidate will have repeat that line and assure the farming family in their constituency that labour would never treat rural community in that way yet within week the chancellor be plan to do exactly that 
 since then family across the country have be try to work out how to pick up the piece after labour ’s family farm tax bomb they will not forget a farmer from derbyshire email i this week to say 
 our hard work and investment as a family have be wipe away in the stroke of a pen 
 they go on to say 
 my year old husband have a bleed on the brain in june and thankfully have make a full recovery but i ’ve never see he so stressed he do not know what to do 
 hon member represent seat in derbyshire may wish to reflect on how they will respond to that a farmer from northumberland have write to i as follow 
 we have to talk about which of my parent be go to die in front of they 
 he say that labour be 
 destroy people ’s live with this policy many of we be worried about the mental state of many within agriculture and be concerned that it may be the final straw for some 
 in fairness   the hon member for hexham joe morris who be in his place have voice concern about whether his government be listen to ordinary people about this will he vote for his farmer or will he toe the party line 
 as a farmer ’s wife i understand the emotional impact that my right hon friend set out so clearly this be about not only the farmer who will be affect but all the farmer who know that they might be affect this be a tax on tragedy and no know if it will befall they 
 my hon friend and lincolnshire neighbour set out exactly the personal impact of the tax i know how treasury ministers look at spreadsheet and those terribly impressive pack of information from civil servant interruption i remind government members that this be deeply serious it be not a joke i also know that chancellor after chancellor have look   at the figure and come to the conclusion that this be a political decision the current chancellor have get it wrong 
 the shadow secretary of state make an important point about the health and wellbeing of our farmer as operation waiting time be almost time high when she be health secretary than they be in do she not welcome the investment that this government be put into our nhs interruption 
 do not worry i will deal with that i thank the hon gentleman for raise the important issue of mental health in farm across the national health service i be proud to work as a member of parliament and as secretary of state for health to massively increase investment in mental health service if he be a rural mp i be sure that he will know how isolated farmer can be and the pressure on their emotion at the good of time they have the weather disease and crop cycle to contend with this pressure merely add to that as we have already hear from farmer who have contact i 
 i also gently remind the hon gentleman that the family farm tax or tax on tragedy as my hon friend   the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson   call it so bleakly will raise £ in accord to the king ’s fund that be equivalent to about a day ’s worth of service in the nhs in england it will not be quite the game changer that some in the hon gentleman ’s party believe it to be 
 what about the family in the south west whose beloved father die a decade ago in tragic circumstance leave young child who be now in their teen the mother have run the farm and bring up their child in the midst of their grief she have now be diagnose with a life threaten illness at the age of of the child want to carry on the farm when they reach but should the unthinkable happen and they lose their mum they will be saddle with labour ’s family farm tax of £ what empathetic and meaningful response do the secretary of state who be not in his place where be he?—or the treasury minister have for that family they will be watch and listen 
 we take the unusual step of give lot of notice to labour mp that we would debate labour ’s family farm tax today we do that because we want to give labour mps in rural seat time to reflect and consider whether they can continue to support this vindictive tax for example a welsh landowner tell i that he will have to sell tenant farm to pay labour ’s family farm tax that be farming family who we on the opposition benches would describe as work people who will lose their business their family home and their child ’s farming future those farming family have be forget by this government 
 the hon member for montgomeryshire and glyndŵr steve witherden   have call on the treasury to produce its modelling on the impact on family farm will the treasury do that at the back bencher ’s request how will he vote today   the hon member for south east cornwall anna gelderd   meet farmer early this month and claim that she would take their concern back to westminster will she raise those today and vote against this tax 
 i have consult widely with farming community and farmer in my constituency i have not be able to identify a single farmer who feel that there be anything good in this policy whatsoever do my right hon friend know whether there be a single labour member of parliament represent a rural community who genuinely believe that they will be vote in their constituent interest tonight 
 i sincerely thank my right hon friend for set out clearly the choice ahead of member across the house we on the opposition benches know who we be stand up for we back our farmer we understand how difficult farming be as a way of life it will be for individual member of parliament to decide how they vote 
 the right hon lady talk about choice and back farmer the current leader of the opposition do a trade deal with australia and new zealand that sell farmer down the river be that her version of back british farmer 
 i be pretty sure that the hon gentleman have his fact wrong about the then trade secretary the conservative party be in favour of trade deal but we want trade deal that well support our farming industry interruption before labour member start shout at i he will know that the fear and concern about those trade deal have not come to fruition what be more we as conservative be proud of the fact that we would not enter trade deal that require the flooding to these shore of chlorinate chicken or hormone treat beef i also gently remind the hon gentleman that as a back bencher talk about foreign territory give the context of the debate about the chagos island be a bit brave 
 we do not have much trade with the chagos island 
 my right hon friend be right to highlight the devastating effect of this policy and to highlight the incredible rounding up exercise on the treasury account book of the contribution that it will make to nhs expenditure with the labour party have a serious foothold in rural constituency for the time since do she not find this rather inept politic which be perhaps not surprising from such a london centric front bench the policy show a wilful ignorance of rural life and a deliberate attempt not to understand the pressure and be in essence sell those rural labour mp down the river 
 i thank my hon friend for that point there be some interesting polling come out today which i will deal with of course mr speaker i very much accept your point about trade but we be genuinely concerned about the national security implication of the chagos island deal 
 i can assure the right hon lady that so be i. 
 very much so mr speaker i will give way to   the hon member for hexham joe morris be he go to speak up for his farmer 
 i commend the right hon lady ’s commitment to honesty she talk about give labour members advance sight of the opposition day motion but when do the labour whips office receive the title of the opposition day debate may i invite she to correct the record perhaps 
 i be so sorry in fairness the hon gentleman be obviously speak to farmer in his constituency on sunday do i hear that there be a protest go on in his constituency at the moment in any event i actually make the announcement on national television on sunday perhaps he be not watch farmer at home will be wonder what on earth we be argue over 
 word that the right hon lady have not mention be brexit the great tory disaster of the last parliament how much do she estimate that brexit cost farmer and the rural community 
 the hon gentleman and i unusually can join force on this matter while i be go to resist the temptation to revisit brexit what i will do be point he to paragraph of the caav report 
 order you be face totally the wrong way i can not pick up anything please turn around 
 my apology mr speaker i be remind of paragraph of the caav report which set out the peculiar legal problem pose by the family farm tax in the context of scottish farming tenant it be incredibly complicated but that be a real concern and i trust that the snp will be explore it alongside conservative members of parliament 
 in conclusion before ambitious back benchers or indeed the exchequer secretary get to their foot and accuse these farmer and we of scaremongere something they have be happy to do in the past they should think on discover some humility and compassion and ask why ten of thousand of decent hard work and sensible people across the united kingdom know that the chancellor have get it so wrong polling by the country land and business association today show what the public think they do not think farmer should be whack with the family farm tax they think that labour have break its promise to end countryside decline they think the government should be cut taxis on rural business and be not confident that the labour government can deliver growth to rural community 
 i say to every hon member on the government benches do the right thing and stand up for our farmer who be the good in the world and whose produce be renowne globally they feed we and now they need we labour mps need to join we and axe the family farm tax 
 i beg to move an amendment to leave out from house to the end of the question and add 
 thank farmer for their immense contribution to the uk economy and the nation ’s food security welcome the government ’s commitment of £ to the farming budget over the next    year the big budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in uk history acknowledge that the government be have to make difficult decision to protect farm and farmer in the context of the £ fiscal blackhole leave by the previous government recognise that the government be seek to target agricultural property relief and business property relief to make they fair whilst also fix the public service that everyone rely on and note that under the change announce in the budget around quarter of claim for agricultural property relief include those that also claim business property relief be expect to not pay more inheritance tax 
 i welcome the chance to open the debate on behalf of the government the government ’s commitment to farmer be steadfast as our amendment make clear farmer make an immense contribution to the uk economy and to the nation ’s food security we recognise and respect the crucial contribution that farmer make to our country ’s way of life 
 we must also recognise however the state of our public service and the mess in which we find the public finance when we come into power there be no way we could have leave thing as they be unlike the conservatives there be never any question of labour ignore the £ black hole that we uncover in the public finance we have to bring the previous administration ’s fiscal irresponsibility to an end we have to ensure that our country live within its mean we have to get public service back on their foot while meet our tough new fiscal rule which end borrow for day to day spending that be what we as a responsible government have to do
