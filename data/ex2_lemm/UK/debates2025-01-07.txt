the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to improve mental health service for child 
 the delivery of mental health service for child in scotland be the responsibility of the scottish government i hope that they will make the good use of the boost from the recent budget to invest in mental health service in england we will support child and young people early by provide access to a specialist mental health professional in every school and roll out young futures hub in every community we will also cut waiting time by recruit more worker across child and adult mental health service 
 the long term impact of the covid-19 pandemic on young people be often forget with isolation lead to miss opportunity lose life experience and still unknown impact on mental health child and adolescent mental health service referral in fife and across scotland have skyrocket and despite a record budget settlement from the uk government the snp scottish government have tell nhs fife not even to bother ask for more funding to tackle this massive problem i and colleague will write to the scottish government about that will the minister join i in urge the scottish government to reverse course and ensure that young people have the support that they deserve and need 
 my hon friend make an excellent point on behalf of young people it be disappointing that the scottish government do not seem to be allocate the funding as they could he raise a powerful case and i know that he will work hard with the government in edinburgh to make the situation well for his constituent 
 be the mental health support in school that the minister just mention the same as or different from the plan for mental health support team in school that be already be roll out by the previous government 
 our plan be to have universal coverage in every school that be not achieve by the previous government and we hope to ensure that it happen 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the increase to employer national insurance contribution on social care 
 this government will never shy away from take the choice necessary to fix the public finance and rebuild our public service it be thank to those choice that we be able to invest an additional £ in in local authority that provide social care we be also deliver the big uplift to the carer ’s allowance since the 1970 an £ uplift to the disabled facility grant and a fair pay agreement for care worker 
 the increase in employer national insurance contribution come at a time when we simply can not afford to lose any more provision from care provider age uk estimate that people age and over already have unmet care and support need what assessment have the minister make of the potential increase in unmet care need as a result of the increase to employer national insurance contribution 
 there be a pattern here the conservatives welcome the additional investment in health and care but oppose the choice that we have make to raise the revenue they need to tell we which service they would cut or which taxis they would raise instead 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 coverage care a not for profit adult social care provider in north shropshire that operate care home and employ around local staff have be in touch to say that it expect the impact of the increase in national insurance contribution to be £ in the full year of implementation give that there be huge number of vacancy across adult social care in north shropshire will the secretary of state consider exempt social care provider from the national insurance increase otherwise we be put money into social care with hand and take it away with the other 
 i refer the hon lady to my previous answer on the very substantial funding that we be provide to local authority which of course be key to the adult social care system however funding must always be marry with reform we have bring forward a pack programme of reform from datum sharing and empower care worker to take on basic healthcare to promote well use of care technology and in the spirit of cross party collaboration that we believe be absolutely vital and urgent in this area i gently encourage she to see those reform as the step towards rebuild our care service and make it fit for the future 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 what recent step he have take to increase access to gp appointment 
 today there be few full time equivalent gps than in and nhs dentistry be at death ’s door this government will fix the front door to the nhs we have announce an additional £ in funding for general practice in the big boost in year and we have already start hire an extra gps on the frontline our year health plan will shift the focus of healthcare out of hospital and into the community 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer on the critical issue of access to gps in primary healthcare my constituency of barking be woefully under serve by primary healthcare and especially by gps on average each gp look after patient the national average be in particular the area of barking riverside have no gp service will the secretary of state meet i to discuss this matter so that the thousand of home that be be build will also have a primary healthcare facility on site 
 order i remind member to look towards the chair because i can not hear what be be say i call the secretary of state i hope he hear the question 
 thank you mr speaker i would be delighted for my hon friend to meet i or the relevant minister the nhs have a statutory duty to ensure sufficient service in each local area include general practice and it be vital that we also take into account population growth and demographic change i strongly support the deputy prime minister ’s commitment to deliver new home and she and i know that that must be accompany by local healthcare facility we be work together to achieve just that 
 i really welcome this government ’s focus on make sure everyone can see a gp when they need the crisis in gp provision nationally have be exacerbate by the failure under the last government to ensure that primary care investment have keep pace with housing growth with such a low share of integrate care board capital funding allocate to primary care by the last government how can we make sure we do much well in ensure that gp capacity expand at the same time as local growth 
 my hon friend have be raise these issue with i since before he be elect to this place on behalf of the community he represent as i say to my hon friend   the member for barking nesil caliskan we must make sure that additional housing which be desperately need be accompany by health and care   service the deputy prime minister and i be work together to achieve just that and thank to the decision take by the chancellor in the budget we be able to invest in the health and care service that this country need and deserve 
 woodstock surgery in my constituency be not fit for purpose in september heavy rain fall and cause the roof to collapse cause the surgery to close the nurse literally see patient in a broom cupboard the gps want to increase their capacity to see more patient but have be unable to access sufficient capital from the integrate care board will the secretary of state meet i and the woodstock gps to discuss how the reform announce yesterday will help they build a new surgery so that they can see patient fast 
 i be grateful to the hon member for that question i be incredibly sorry about the awful condition in which staff in that practice be have to see patient and in which the patient it serve be have to be see that be the epitome of the broken general practice system that we inherit thank to the decision take by the chancellor in the budget we be able to invest in the capital estate need in the nhs that will take time and we would be delighted to hear more about that individual case to see how the icb and the nhs can assist 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 follow the theme raise by my hon friend and neighbour   the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller may i make a plea for summertown health centre they be my doctor by the way so i declare an interest they operate in an old victorian building and be desperate to move to new premise that health centre be at the top of the priority list but the icb say that there be no money and the doctor say that there be no pot that they can bid into in order to get this see to will the secretary of state meet i as well clearly £ spread across project in the country be not go to be sufficient can we get creative about how we can get new premise build for summertown health centre 
 of course i will meet the hon lady it would be daft of i to say no to the chair of the select committee otherwise she will see i in less pleasant circumstance in all seriousness we be look creatively at this issue there be enormous capital pressure right across the nhs estate we be regularly lobby on new hospital for example but we be also lobby on general practice the mental health estate and the rest we will do as much as we can as fast as we can think creatively about how we can get more capital investment in and i would be happy to discuss that far with the hon lady 
 when i be out regularly knock on door and listen to people across the constituency of the issue resident raise with i most frequently be the challenge in even be able to book a gp ’s appointment could the secretary of state please set out what his plan be for end that be phone scramble include for those who do not use app and website as confidently 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that question as the prime minister set out in our elective reform plan yesterday we be determined to make sure that access nhs service include general practice dentistry and other primary care service be as easy and convenient as access any other service at the touch of a button via our smartphone we have commit to that in the elective reform plan which will bring benefit right across the nhs as we modernise of course she be right to mention those who may not be digitally connected or may not want to access service in that way that be why i believe very strongly in patient choice different course for different horse people like i book via the app will free up telephone line for those who prefer to access service that way 
 be the secretary of state aware that the increase to employer national insurance be actually reduce patient access to primary care i meet gp representative in aberdeenshire and aberdeen recently and they tell i of way in which that be happen they be have to let staff go and secondly some gps be consider meet these cost from their own pocket will he consider an exemption for gp practice from these charge 
 that be a rare admission of failure in this house by the snp i be very sorry to hear that general practice in scotland be in such a sorry state because here in england we be invest £ in general practice the big uplift in year that be in addition to the funding i have find to employ more gps on the frontline before april because we be prioritise general practice as for the decision the chancellor take in the budget as i say before the election all road lead to westminster thank to the decision a labour chancellor have make here in westminster come down that road from westminster to holyrood be the resource the snp government need to deliver the priority of the scottish people if they can not anas sarwar and jackie baillie stand ready to deliver 
 i call the shadow minister 
 to improve access the government have announce a plan expansion of advice and guidance and gps will be pay £ per advice and guidance request they make for further expert advice from consultant how do the government expect this expansion to take place will they be mandate it give that the current position of the british medical association under its collective action be that gps should 
 stop engage with the e referral advice guidance pathway 
 i think the shadow minister will find that gps welcome the £ uplift announce just before christmas that be the big boost to general practice in year it be part of this government ’s agenda to fix the front door to the nhs and recognise the dire state that gps be leave under of course with that investment come reform i think gps would be delighted to manage more of their patient in the community if give the tool to do the job and that be something this government be commit to do 
 go back to advice and guidance gps use advice and guidance when they have come to the summit of their knowledge and need specialist input for example as a gp i may see a rheumatology patient and ask for advice from a rheumatologist who may advise specialist blood test the problem be that as the inquiry clinician i be legally responsible for those blood test and have to pay for they out of the primary care budget do the government propose that the £ will cover subsequent follow up and the cost of suggest test give the expansion of advice and guidance will the government be look at a legal framework change in accountability for clinician make request 
 as the shadow minister have say advice and guidance happen in general practice and we want to see more of it we have to give gps the tool to do the job and that be what we be do my hon friend the minister for care will be talk to the bma shortly in the context of contract negotiation in the usual way what the shadow minister neglect to mention be that these reform and improvement to general practice be make possible thank to the £ we be put in which be investment that he and his party oppose 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 dentistry be a key part of primary care yet an estimate people in england have be leave without an nhs dentist that be why today a petition be be hand in at downing street sign by more than a quarter of a people we have move on from the election but we do not yet have a timetable for when the negotiation for a new nhs dental contract will begin and when another extra urgent appointment will be roll out can the secretary of state confirm the timetable for those improvement what specifically be the government ’s plan for the new patient premium and will he offer assurance to dentist that any change to the current model will be outline in detail to they as soon as possible 
 we be look at thing the of which be make sure we deliver what we say in our manifesto include the urgent appointment we be determined to deliver those as fast as we can and my hon friend the minister for care be have discussion with the british dental association to that effect he be also look closely as be i at the money that be already go into nhs dentistry how that money could be well spend and how it be that year after year despite people ’s tooth rot to the extent that they be have to pull they out themselves or child have to attend a&e to have their tooth pull out we see consistent underspend in the dentistry budget under our predecessor we be determined to give dentist the tool to do the job so that patient can see a dentist when they need 
 what step his department be take to support drug and alcohol addiction treatment service 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his campaigning on this important issue and indeed for speak so honestly about his own experience during his time in this house an additional £ have be invest this year to improve the quality and capacity of drug and alcohol treatment and recovery we be committed to correct the year of disinvestment in treatment and recovery service and ensure that people can access the support they need 
 the minister have do it for i but i alert colleague to my interest in this area 
 last month the advertising standards authority rule against company pose as treatment provider or impartial advice service or for fail to make clear their role in earn commission when they be in fact broker and i can tell the minister that many more such company escape that ruling they be able to mislead family while take cut of up to of fee be pay directly to treatment provider frankly they have be able to run the sector like a racket can we make sure that this ruling by the advertising standards authority be the start of something new where we can seek to regulate practice properly and will the minister meet i and interested party 
 attempt to exploit people with addiction be reprehensible free drug and alcohol treatment be available in every part of the country and i urge anyone who be struggle right now to visit the nhs addiction website the care quality commission have say that it could take legal action against company misuse its logo and google have say it would remove search listing from these company i be more than happy to meet my hon friend to see what more we can do to stop this outrageous activity 
 social prescribing be of the primary care service provide for drug and alcohol addiction and it also support the government ’s aim of move from cure to prevention which be why i be shocked to hear that a primary care network in my constituency be review its social prescribing offering across the chichester district and propose to remove it entirely do the minister agree that social prescribing be a key pillar of our primary care service and do the money use need to be ringfence to protect that service across the country 
 social prescribing be of the tool and it be an important in address public health concern in each of our constituency this government be commit to ensure that we get those shift from sickness to prevention we will be ensure that local area have public health funding in reasonable time we be about to announce in due course this year ’s allocation we need to make sure that local system maximise the use of their money and that certainly include social prescribing 
 in there be more than death from alcohol use we know that more than people have an alcohol dependency we need to focus not just on treatment service and their funding but on prevention the last   government fail to bring forward a timely alcohol strategy will the minister update the house on what he be do to ensure that we be tackle this massive situation in our community 
 my hon friend raise an important point as part of the government ’s health mission we be produce a point plan for prevention and alcohol harm be of those area i hope to be able to update she and the house in due course on the action we will be take to drive down the prevalence of alcohol harm and other addiction because they be cost life and cause misery in community that be why this government be determined to tackle these public health problem 
 i thank the minister for his answer while there be community addiction service for those over the age of worryingly across this great united kingdom those under the age of be succumb to alcohol addiction too there do not seem to be any provision for they may i ask the minister genuinely and helpfully what provision there will be for those under the age of because addiction problem be rise among the young generation 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point this government be commit to have the healthy generation of child ever that mean we will have a concerted effort on a whole range of health issue that determine the health and wellbeing of young people which will hopefully ensure that they become healthy adult as a consequence alcohol harm be certainly of the consideration we will be look at 
 what step his department be take to help reduce nhs waiting time 
 this government be deliver on our commitment to cut nhs waiting list and end the tory backlog we have take immediate action with an additional £ to support elective activity this year that funding will support the delivery of our step of extra elective appointment a week with investment must come reform and the elective reform plan publish yesterday and announce by the prime minister set out how we will cut nhs wait to the week standard increase productivity reform the system and improve patient choice and control over their healthcare 
 almost in scot be stick on an nhs waiting list people be borrow money and remortgage their home to go private because they can not bear the pain with an snp government who have abandon the principle of an nhs free at the point of entry do my right hon friend agree that scotland ’s health service need a new direction 
 i strongly agree with my hon friend as i say during the general election campaign it be quote regularly by the snp all road lead to westminster down that road from westminster be a record increase in funding for the scottish government through the   barnett formula i know the scottish government publish their own nhs recovery plan just before christmas and i look forward to read it although i know some have express concern about the lack of detail in the plan to drive down waiting time the scottish people can therefore compare and contrast with the ambition of our elective reform plan which be announce by the prime minister yesterday and then decide at the next scottish election who they trust to govern the snp with its rotten record or a labour government who will get on and deliver 
 the secretary of state know that i write to he before christmas about the plan ward closure and degradation of service at goole and district general hospital do so will take bed facility and employee away from the national health service which will do nothing but undermine his real attempt to reduce waiting list and all the plan he announce yesterday will he look at the trust level decision system that lead to such catastrophic decision that will undermine every aspect of nhs strategy and all that he be try to do 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for write to i before christmas i recognise the pressure that have be place on nhs commissioner in recent year and the pressure that that have put on service configuration i tend to support the devolution of decision making with decision about service reconfiguration take close to the community they serve i recognise also that commissioner do not always get it right which be why engagement with member of parliament and other democratically elect representative be important ministerial oversight be important too we will look seriously at the issue he raise and talk to nhs leader and i know he will be do the same this government be determined to give nhs leader the tool to do the job so that we can get the right care in the right place at the right time with a well experience for patient and well value for taxpayer 
 i be sure my right hon friend will share my delight at the fact that in our grow community of thanet the nhs be look to open the thanet integrate hub in of the most deprived part of kent however tory run kent county council have put in spurious objection to the development do he share my concern that such unnecessary objection block access to healthcare and make it hard for the government and the nhs to cut waiting list 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the work she be do to improve health and care service for her constituent the government be give health and care provider the tool to do the job of course change will take time and it be therefore crucial that we all pull together locally and nationally for the avoidance of doubt the government be on the side of the builder not the blocker 
 the nhs confederation have say that for the government to be able to drive down waiting list 
 the pause to the delivery of the new hospital programme must be as short as possible and nhs leader need clarity about timeline 
 with that in mind will the secretary of state tell leader at eastbourne district general hospital as well as our community in eastbourne precisely when the new hospital programme review will be complete so that we can get crack with our upgrade 
 i thank the hon member for that question i agree with he about the need for clarity as well as consistency we undertake the review into the new hospital programme because the previous government ’s timetable be a work of fiction and the money be not there i hope to report to he and to the house shortly on that with the undertaking that the timetable we publish and the funding provide by the chancellor in the budget and at the spending review will mean that we will provide not just clarity but consistency which be important for nhs leader important for patient and important for the construction industry partner we need to work with 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank you mr deputy speaker interruption i be sorry that be the last time i will get call thank you mr speaker 
 yesterday in relation to the elective backlog the secretary of state say 
 where we can treat work people fast we will and we make no apology for do so ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 labour politician have struggle to define what they mean by work people but his word have cause anxiety will he reassure those with disability that prevent they from work and retire elderly people who have work all their life that they will not be push to the back of the queue and that treatment will continue to be provide in the nhs on the basis of clinical need 
 of course clinical need be paramount and must always drive decision making about who to treat when and the order in which people be treat that be why i find the question pose so deeply disingenuous interruption we inherit nhs waiting list at record level and waiting time that be frankly shameful the shadow minister should be apologise for her party ’s record and she should also apologise for the tier healthcare system that see those who can afford it pay to go private and those who can not afford it working class people be leave behind that be the tier system that the government be determined to end 
 order can we be a bit careful with the language we be use 
 the secretary of state need to be careful with the word he use as you say mr speaker because his word do cause anxiety among people it be not a disingenuous question it be a genuine question to make sure that people be reassure 
 it will not have escape the secretary of state ’s notice that it be cold outside removal of the winter fuel allowance have reduce elderly people ’s ability to follow the advice that he give last week which be to turn the heating on what assessment have he make of the number of additional admission cause by his removal of the winter fuel allowance what effect be that have on the government ’s ability to deliver their reduction in elective backlog 
 what the shadow minister neglect to mention be that the chancellor have protect the winter fuel allowance for the poor pensioner and she have also put in place the warm home discount to assist people with their energy bill throughout the winter if the shadow minister do not support the decision that the chancellor take at the budget and ahead of the budget to raise vital investment for our health and care service that be fair enough but then she need to tell people which nhs service she would cut or which other taxis she would increase 
 whether he have make an assessment of the effectiveness of improvement make to the care quality commission 
 in response to the report by dr penny dash we have make it clear that the cqc be not fit for purpose and require significant reform we have increase our oversight of the cqc to ensure implementation of the recommendation in dr dash ’s review and we will continue to monitor the cqc ’s progress through this period of improvement we be also support the swift and efficient recruitment of cqc leadership role include the new chief executive julian hartley who start in december 
 it be inarguable that the cqc need improvement many who run care service in local authority have little confidence in its performance do my hon friend agree that we could go some way to improve how it be view by look at the use of single word assessment which create undue stress for social service lead they be raise by the dash review as insufficient to support local authority to improve promote box tick over real improvement and give little information to member of the public on the quality of social service provision 
 my hon friend be right that confidence be the key word in the huge agenda that the cqc have to deliver dr dash and professor mike richards highlight serious failing that need to be re address as of our predecessor say priority be our language currently a review of or word rating be not a priority but it will be keep under review 
 be the minister indicate today that there will be a new start in the care quality commission and that thing will change for both staff and the recipient of care 
 the hon gentleman make an excellent point particularly with regard to staff who need support   to continue their important work a new start with new leadership be what they need as well as implementation of the recommendation 
 what step his department be take to improve access to mental health service 
 what step his department be take to improve access to mental health service 
 as lord darzi ’s independent investigation find around people be wait to access mental health service in england this government will fix our broken mental health service by recruit more mental health worker provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school and roll out young future hub in every community 
 in my constituency of harrogate and knaresborough we have hear harrowing story from people who have try to reach out and get access to mental health service before they reach crisis point often people end up face month long if not year long waiting list when all too often they reach a crisis point they end up have to access service as far away as newcastle or manchester what be the government do to make sure that we can root local community mental health facility in community such as harrogate and knaresborough 
 in addition to the measure that i just set out in the budget the chancellor make funding available to expand talk therapy to extra patient we have a £ capital investment scheme for mental health crisis centre and as always with this government investment go with reform we be finally reform the mental health act that be talk about when theresa may be in downing street this government be roll up their sleeve and get on with the job 
 taunton and wellington be a trailblazer in take mental health from hospital to community and from sickness to prevention the trust be the in the country to merge mental health with the hospital trust will the minister meet the trust and i to understand how successful that programme be and to discuss the much need maternity and paediatric unit at musgrove park hospital 
 it sound like there be some interesting dynamic and innovative work go on in the area that the hon gentleman mention i would be happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 i have just be visit by my former medical student a young doctor in yorkshire work in an intensive therapy unit who tell i that of the patient who be admit with covid die many healthcare worker be suffer from flashback and post traumatic stress disorder what measure will the   government take to look after the mental health of the healthcare worker who so bravely help we during the covid pandemic 
 my hon friend raise an important point which provide an opportunity for we all to reflect on the incredible work of those work in our health service they be in many way hero and we should absolutely acknowledge that fact we need to explore the point he have raise we could meet to discuss it far or i would be happy to write to he 
 in england more than people be wait for an autism assessment in september in my constituency some adult have wait more than year for an autism assessment and child have be wait year and be still wait to receive support from child and adolescent mental health service these delay have a profound impact on people ’s life will the minister commit to the mental health investment standard and ensure that as the government reduce waiting time they do so for both physical and mental health service for young people and adult 
 we remain absolutely committed to the mental health investment standard we have prioritise the expansion of nhs talk therapy and individual placement and support scheme and provide £ of capital funding to open new mental health centre however we be not complacent on this issue my hon friend speak about autism assessment which be a red light that be flash on my dashboard i would be happy to discuss that far with she 
 whether his department plan to improve integration of counsellor and psychotherapist into the mental health workforce 
 counsellor and psychotherapist form an integral part of the nhs mental health workforce deliver support to people with mental ill health across a range of setting in service for both child and young people and adult we will publish a refresh nhs long term workforce plan to ensure that the nhs have the right people in the right place with the right skill to deliver the care that patient need 
 be there a plan to maintain service provision where psychotherapist and counsellor operate in the charity sector have be hit by eye watering cost increase as a consequence of the national insurance increase 
 as i have say in answer to previous question and as my right hon friend the secretary of state have say there be something of a pattern emerge here opposition member say that they welcome the investment the government have make but oppose the revenue raise measure and refuse to set out whether they would increase taxis or cut service i still have not hear an answer on that from those member 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on staff salary in the care sector 
 this government recognise the crisis in social care that we inherit which be why over the past month we have take step through the budget to increase investment in social care deliver the big expansion of the carer ’s allowance since the 1970 and invest in the disabled facility grant of course as my hon friend allude to we can not deliver great social care without the worker who deliver it that be why i be proud that within our day the care worker turn deputy prime minister include fair pay agreement in her landmark employment rights bill so we can give our care staff not just the pay they deserve but the professional status recognise the hard work they do as care professional that be a crucial step on our path to build a national care service 
 do the secretary of state agree that the snp ’s national care service scotland bill be a miss opportunity to improve pay and condition for social care worker particularly when compare with labour ’s employment rights bill which create the fair pay agreement for social care worker 
 i agree with my hon friend i be proud that this government have take quick action within our day thank to the employment rights bill which be uk wide legislation this labour government in westminster be give the scottish government the tool they need to do the job of establish fair pay for care staff if they do not do it anas sarwar and jackie baillie will 
 in north east lincolnshire a social enterprise employ staff provide health and social care i have be approach by many staff who be unhappy that they have not benefit from the increase that nhs staff have gain they have the support of the royal college of nursing and be look for the government to provide care plus group which employ they with the resource to ensure that they be recompense to the same level what be the secretary of state able to pass on to they 
 i be grateful to the hon member for that question with our fair pay agreement we will be bring together government public and private sector employer and staff trade union to negotiate the future for fair pay agreement that will benefit care worker across the system and give they the professional status and career progression they deserve the chancellor through the budget also take step to ensure that we could invest in our social care service i be deeply sadden that the conservative party have not support that investment 
 i call dame emily thornberry congratulation 
 how many and what proportion of nhs employee have receive enhanced maternity leave entitlement under agenda for change contract 
 i thank my new dame friend for her question the department do not collect datum on the number of people who have specifically receive enhanced maternity leave entitlement access to an enhanced maternity leave benefit form part of the total reward package for agenda for change staff which we believe be critical for retain our much value and need nhs workforce 
 thank you very much mr speaker doctor throughout the nhs no matter who employ they have blanket maternity agreement but nurse do not when i visit the river place health centre i find that nurse employ by whittington health be work alongside nurse employ by the gp practice who get completely different maternity leave and pay as we turn out our hospital into the community and do much more work in that way such anomaly will get bad it be not fair and i wonder what my hon friend be go to do about it 
 my right hon friend highlight a problem throughout the system not just in her area self employ contractor to nhs gp surgery be not bind by national term and condition they can develop their term and condition as they see fit they have the flexibility to set term and condition to aid recruitment and retention we anticipate that good employer will set wage rate and term and condition that reflect the skill and experience of their staff that be well for staff and for patient and i know that she will continue to highlight that with her local employer it be certainly something that we need to keep an eye on as we develop service far 
 what step he be take to extend start for life service to south cambridgeshire constituency 
 we believe that every child deserve the good start in life due to the challenging fiscal context we be initially prioritise family hub and start for life fund to area of high deprivation we will consider the case for extension to south cambridgeshire in future financial year 
 we know how important the good start in life be for opportunity for all only half upper tier local authority currently receive prioritise start for life and family hub funding—78 do not in south cambridgeshire officer be do huge work to provide support and signpost without dedicated funding which mean that baby young parent and young family do not receive the full benefit will the minister commit in the next spending review to extend these service across the whole of england 
 local authority be pre select use the income deprivation affect child index average rank score with a rural and urban weighting apply tackle child inequality in health and outcome be crucial as resource allow it be the ambition of the government to ensure that start for life service reach every child 
 what step he be take to ensure that brain tumour be include in the national cancer plan 
 let i start by commend the hon gentleman for his fundraising effort to fight cancer in surrey and his support for the brain tumour charity we be committed to ensure that people with brain tumour have access to more effective treatment and excellent care through for instance our national cancer plan and we will give more detail shortly 
 i thank the minister for his answer and for his googling of my background early detection be essential in ensure that brain tumour do not fall far behind other cancer in priority will the minister update we on the government ’s progress to ensure that screening be prioritise 
 we absolutely want to ensure early detection of these cancer and i recently meet representative of the brain tumour charity to discuss how we can roll that out the government be invest an awful lot of money in tackle cancer but there be a great deal more that we can do on brain cancer 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 we have be busy announce investment in hospice an uplift in funding for general practice action through disabled facility grant and a new independent commission on adult social care and yesterday the prime minister announce the elective care reform plan as i have say however the nhs be experience a period of significant winter challenge the number of bed occupy by people with flu have be much high than the number last year and be continue to rise an average of just over bed be occupy by flu patient at the end of december surpass the peak of about report last year we monitor the situation closely work hand in hand with nhs england and care leader and i continue to chair weekly meeting with senior leader in social care nhs england and the uk health security agency 
 i be sure the secretary of state will share my shock and anger about the number of young people in my constituency who be wait more than year for a assessment by child and adult mental health service can he confirm that yesterday ’s   commitment by the prime minister that patient would not wait more than week for a appointment will apply to camhs in oxfordshire

 i be in cumbria recently and i be strike by the fact that the care home i visit in carlisle be deliver great intermediate care for the nhs at half the price of a hospital bed a really good example of how social care often deliver well value and well care however the hon gentleman be right about the   recruitment challenge we be determined to work with local training provider and the local university to make sure that we recruit social care worker grow our own in cumbria and keep they in cumbria 
 the east of england ambulance service nhs trust remain at the high escalation level level as call handler in bedford remain under immense pressure after respond to call between christmas and new year despite the unprecedented demand the trust be consider close the bedford emergency operation centre put nearly job at risk give that resource be already stretch to the limit in bedford do the secretary of state agree that we must keep experienced staff who have help to save countless life in the region 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the particular problem in his constituency decision on the configuration of call centre be a matter for local trust in consultation with staff and representative and i encourage he to continue to engage with the trust in the interest of his constituent 
 will the additional money announce for hospice before christmas cover the full cost of the increase in employer ’s national insurance contribution or not 
 the conservatives can not on the hand welcome the investment and on the other hand condemn the mean of raise it would they cut nhs and care service or would they raise other taxis they have to answer

 i be very sorry to hear about the hon gentleman ’s constituent i know at hand how complex and debilitate long covid can be as i mention in an early answer there be a stocktake taking place which should show where there be deficiency but let i be clear i want to ensure that there be good service for people suffer with long covid in every part of england 
 the isle of wight do not just have a problem with its ferry as the house would expect we also have a huge problem with dentistry we be a true dental desert however the size of our community mean that we be an ideal place to try new approach to dentistry especially for child will the minister meet i to discuss those approach and improve dentistry on the island 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to describe the isle of wight as a dental desert that be perhaps of the reason why the good people of that island elect a labour member for the time in history our ambition be to make sure that everyone who need a dentist can get sadly of adult in england—13 people have an unmet need for nhs dentistry i would be glad to meet my hon friend to learn more about how the experience of the isle of wight can improve service nationally 
 prostate cancer be the most common cancer in man yet it have no national screening programme we work on this issue in government and i thank the secretary of state for take an interest in this area will he join i in commend prostate cancer research ’s excellent new report and urge his team to consider the finding not least on increase screening of at risk group so that we can not just save the nhs money but more importantly save thousand of life 
 i welcome the former prime minister ’s question and he be right to commend the research we be actively look at it give that he be here and that we be currently take through the tobacco and vapes bill i thank he for his leadership on that issue 
 the last government treat mental health as a cinderella service with my constituent wait day in a&e to be admit to hospital mental health ward the solace centre in ealing southall provide help and support in the community for those with mental health problem at a fraction of the cost of a hospital stay how do the minister intend to move more mental health service from hospital to the community and to create more great service like the solace centre 
 i thank my hon friend for her excellent question she be right that it be vital to move service from hospital to community the chancellor    make funding available for more talk therapy for patient and put in place a £ capital investment scheme for mental health crisis centre a lot of work have be do but there be a lot more still to do 
 will the secretary of state confirm what be be do to ensure that patient with rare and complex condition such as functional neurologic disorder and achalasia can access consistent and co ordinated care include referral to the multidisciplinary team they need for the different symptom they experience 
 the hon member be right to raise case where there be multiple comorbiditie or complex condition require a range of care service that be why we need to design service around the patient not expect patient to contort themselves around the service our approach to neighbourhood health service should make a real difference in that regard but we have to go far and fast on health and care integration and we absolutely will 
 order i call kevin mckenna to ask the final question 
 i strongly welcome yesterday ’s announcement about use initiative such as community diagnostic centre to move service close to the public in the isle of sheppey we be particularly expose as a coastal community but thankfully a new cdc will really help unfortunately my experience in the nhs over the past few year show that while the previous government talk the talk about shift care to the community they fail to deliver will the secretary of state set out what step will be take so i can show my constituent that this shift will actually happen 
 i be delighted to have my hon friend and his experience in the house stand up for his community and give we his advice and wisdom as we develop our year plan we be already walk the talk on the shift to community not least through the big uplift in funding for general practice announce before christmas many people assume our elective reform plan be just about hospital waiting list but a big part of it be about deliver the left shift by ask and fund general practice to do more to manage patient in the community 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the situation in northern gaza 
 the situation in northern gaza be dire the uk condemn israel ’s restriction on aid in the strong term the scale of human suffering be unimaginable we have be clear that this be a man make crisis and israel must act immediately to address it 
 the need for humanitarian assistance to reach gaza be great than ever before close to people have now be kill all of gaza ’s population be report to face the risk of famine air strike within the designate humanitarian zone show there be no safe space leave for civilian report of up to child have die from the cold weather condition be unconscionable 
 it be unacceptable that many medical facility be no long in use or be inaccessible to humanitarian actor and we remain deeply concerned by report of medic be kill or injure i have raise this and will continue to raise this with both the israeli deputy foreign minister and israel ’s ambassador to the united kingdom i have also specifically raise the detention of kamal adwan hospital director dr hussam abu safiya with both the israeli deputy foreign minister and israel ’s ambassador to the uk we urge israel to urgently clarify the reason for his detention as well as for the detention of paediatrician mohammed hamouda and all the other health worker detain in gaza 
 the uk be do all we can to alleviate this suffering we have provide £ for the occupied palestinian territories this financial year include £ for the united nations relief and works agency provide vital service to civilian in gaza and the west bank and to palestinians across the region deliver through partner agency 
 the uk be also support the provision of essential healthcare to civilian in gaza include support to uk med for operate its field hospital and we have provide £ to the egyptian ministry of health to support medically evacuate palestinians from gaza 
 the foreign secretary work with his french and german counterpart write to the government of israel in november to press they to ensure adequate preparation for winter make no mistake in lockstep with our partner we be continue to exert pressure to make sure that northern gaza be not cut off from the south that gazans be not forcibly transfer from or within gaza and that there be no reduction in the territory of the gaza strip 
 we need a ceasefire we need hostage to be release we need much more aid into gaza and we need civilian to be protect 
 over day on we all know the statistics—45,000 palestinians kill hostage miss people desperate but i want to tell a single human story i have previously speak about my friend   consultant surgeon mohamed who operate on i when i have sepsis his family be trap in the jabalia refugee camp they be elderly and sick be a year old girl he have describe how there be body strew in the street 
 i be sorry to report that death do not come knock this weekend rather it be drop by a precision drone as mohamed ’s brother and his son walk metre to get aid the son die of a brain injury year old girl and their mother have shrapnel wound and mohamed ’s elderly father who be already ill be in hospital a year old her mother and mohamed ’s mother be alone in a house with no to help they get food 
 these be obviously not militant they be sick they be not legitimate target of war there be no excuse for this mohamed tell i it feel like they be live in the hunger games dodge drone and scavenging for the basic even if they want to leave how can they 
 what part of international law make any of this okay where be the accountability where be the justice what do the minister have to say to mohamed who spend his day save life here in the uk while his family be slaughter overnight 
 and it be not just mohamed people in gaza be trap in a doom loop of hell hospital decimate and ceasefire promise and never deliver so i press the government again be this really everything the uk have get have we deploy everything to make this stop when will we recognise palestine why have we not stop the arm trade to israel and when will the government ban trading with illegal settlement 
 the frustration be palpable our grief be fathomless people across the uk be look on in horror and the horror in gaza must stop now 
 the hon member speak passionately about a situation that so few in this house could even imagine my thought be with mohamed ’s family and the many many other woman child and civilian who be catch up in this war 
 i have see for myself the injure child across the border in sinai they be the lucky one who have be able to leave the strip to access medical assistance the whole foreign office ministerial team have these people in our mind each and every day i have be engage through the break as many other have recognise that for most people in palestine there be no break from a truly dreadful situation 
 the hon member ask what i have to say to mohamed and i be incredibly sorry for the loss that people be suffer in palestine i be incredibly sorry that we continue to assess that there be a serious risk of breach of international humanitarian law in gaza we be do everything we can to try to prevent and reduce they in relation to the arm that she mention we have take decisive action to reduce the sale of weapon be use in the conduct of the hostility in gaza the west bank and lebanon and will continue to keep the matter under review i can only join with the hon member for oxford west and abingdon in reach out to those in palestine in this situation we have do much we recognise there be much more to do my heart go out to those people 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 may i begin by pay tribute to the bravery of   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   in continue to fight for the population in gaza even as her own family and friend be suffer 
 my committee be currently undertake an inquiry into the israel palestine conflict and we have hear again and again from witness include both israeli and palestinian voice that the uk could in fact be do more to bring the conflict to an end we have also hear from witness include the former member for north east bedfordshire who be also the very respected former minister for the middle east that where uk action have come it have be too little and too late while i know that the minister be unable to comment on any ongoing negotiation i would like to know this what role be the uk playing in convene post conflict discussion and what do he see as a viable long term resolution for gaza 
 this government have take a very different approach from the that come before we we have take immediate rapid action call for a ceasefire make decision on arm which have already be mention increase the amount of aid available to the occupied palestinian territories be absolutely steadfast in our support to unwra and restore funding that have be cut let we not think that there be no difference between the policy position take by the ministers here on the front bench and those that come before we my predecessor mention by my right hon friend   the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry be a good and wise man who have do much in the service of his country yet let we not have any illusion there be a difference between what a labour government have do in relation to the middle east and what our predecessor do 
 i reassure my right hon friend that we be very engaged in the question about what must happen next in gaza clearly gaza need a solution that work for its people where gaza be govern by the palestinians under their own legitimate authority in safety and security there be a wide range of international view about how we might get to that objective and we be play our full part diplomatically to try and ensure that there be consensus 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for secure this urgent question innocent civilian in gaza be suffer and the situation be desperate everyone in the house recognise that and we all want aid and support to reach they do the minister also recognise that innocent civilian be be use continuously as human shield by hamas which have no regard for their safety or welfare there be no excuse for the current situation interruption perhaps   the hon member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald   can listen to my comment and then he can comment afterwards 
 get aid over the border be absolutely critical in the light of the minister ’s word he will also recognise notwithstanding his comment about the previous conservative government that that government actively identify different way to get aid into gaza and secure food aid in particular a special representative for humanitarian affair be appoint who be on the ground with a clear remit to address bottleneck and those issue there be clear proposal put to the government of israel to increase the delivery of aid and support there be active dialogue and israel make a number of significant and welcome commitment will the minister give detail of the recent engagement on fulfil those vital commitment how those responsible be be hold to account and whether the foreign office under his government have identify and propose new and alternative route for aid delivery in recent week 
 importantly the only other way to bring this appalling humanitarian conflict and suffering to a sustainable end in gaza be for hamas to release all the hostage i appreciate that we have debate this difficult matter previously but may i ask the minister what discussion be currently take place the onus as we know be on hamas but what step be the government take right now there be many hostage that we know of include emily damari whom we have speak about before all our thought be with those hostage and their family we must know what the uk ’s position be especially in relation to call out hamas us secretary of state antony blinken be right to say at the weekend that we have not see a great deal of condemnation may i conclude by ask the minister what point of influence we have with israel in particular and what his government be do to address this conflict 
 the shadow foreign secretary rightly raise the important role of the special representative for humanitarian affair he remain in post and continue to have dialogue with the israelis and other about what can be do to ensure that adequate aid get into gaza there have be a great deal of discussion about different route i have be to north sinai to see the route in through al arish and my right hon friend the minister for development have be in jordan to see the route there the most fundamental of all of these question be who control the crossing in most case that be the israeli government and the step that need to be take sit most acutely with they 
 there be of course other question that be important and relevant not least those to do with law and order in the gaza strip where there be serious and concern report of looting none the less get the aid in be vital and that be through the crossing we have be raise these point forcefully with the israeli government and it have be disappointing to see with my own eye british aid pile up in al arish despite the good effort of the special envoy and other to encourage the israelis to make progress in deliver the flood of aid into gaza that they promise 
 rise 
 sorry i be just take a breath on the vital question about hostage we be continue to use all of our influence to try to ensure an early resolution to the crisis which have be go on for far far too   long we must work each and every day to try to advance that situation clearly give the degree of tactical leaking to the press about the late talk i do not want to comment on press report 
 i call the chair of international development committee 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this question i also thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for all the work that she have do try to highlight the horror that be go on in the region 
 what assessment have the government make of israel ’s action in the netzarim corridor which israel have clear of palestinian civilian in order to construct military road and position senior israeli official tell haaretz that the area have be designate as a kill zone with anyone who enter be shoot the same officer tell haaretz that civilian be knowingly kill and later designate as terrorist with competition between military unit regard who can cause the most casualty what assessment have the minister make of these allege war crime and can he tell i what we be do to document and to stop they 
 mr speaker as you would expect my department take careful stock of all report include those that my hon friend mention and we include they as part of our regular assessment we have conclude of those assessment recently and i have already update the house on that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for her powerful and sustained advocacy for palestinians clearly the situation in northern gaza be utterly dire we need to see action from the government in the face of a dreadful and worsen situation at the end of december israeli force close kamal adwan the last functional hospital in northern gaza forcibly remove patient and detain its director dr abu safiya the minister say that he have raise this matter with the israeli deputy foreign minister and the ambassador but what consequence do he spell out to they if israel fail to meet its obligation to protect civilian and sustain access to healthcare in northern gaza 
 the minister also refer to israeli airstrike in the allegedly safe zone i have on previous occasion ask the foreign secretary to look again at a full ban on arm sale will the minister now do so we will only see an end to violence with a ceasefire so can the minister update the house on progress towards the release of the israeli hostage hold by hamas and a last ceasefire 
 finally in the light of deep concern about the direction that this conflict might take under the trump presidency and follow remark make by israeli government ministers about annexation and action on the ground in the west bank to extend illegal settlement do the minister agree that now be the moment to recognise palestine on the border 
 let i take the hon member ’s question in turn on arm sale we have be clear and i be pleased to reiterate that clarity today that we have take step in relation to the weapon at issue in gaza we keep that under regular review but we have take clear principled step if the question relate to the f-35 programme i be happy to reiterate that we carve out that provision because there be no other way to meet our obligation in relation to international peace and security and that remain the position 
 on the matter of a ceasefire effort be ongoing we hope to see an early resolution but i be afraid that we have be here many time before these be incredibly fraught talk flexibility need to be show on all side the violence have go on for far too long we want an immediate ceasefire which we have call for since we come into government 
 i have raise the situation in kamal adwan and the wide matter about the provision of healthcare in northern gaza i have be clear with the israeli government about their obligation under international humanitarian law to ensure that proper medical assistance be available to gazan people they be entitle to that and those obligation be clear in international law i have make that clear to the israelis as well as what the consequence will be internationally if those obligation be not meet 
 the hon member also raise a question about illegal settlement i be pleased to repeat our position we do not support the annexation of gaza we support the boundary and we deplore illegal settlement which be why we take sanction against they late last year 
 i thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for secure this urgent question it be indeed urgent at the un the uk call for israel to abide by unsc resolution on the protection of civilian and healthcare it be clear that israel be not abide by that resolution so with the word have be utter and ignore what will the government now do to ensure that israel be hold to account for its action 
 we could not be clear either publicly or privately about what expectation fall on israel in relation to health provision i have raise these issue the foreign secretary have raise these issue and my ministerial colleague have raise these issue it be a source of enormous frustration to the ministerial team that this far into the conflict we be still have to raise these issue and we will continue to do so until there be some resolution and that resolution must enable great healthcare for the palestinians of gaza and the wide region 
 mr speaker you and i have be through this rigmarole many time over the past month i be go to ask today about the fate of dr abu safiya but i think we all know what will happen to he i be go to ask about the baby who be freeze to death while blanket be be deny entry into gaza but i do not think we will be able to do much about that the same apply to the denial of access for cancer medication anaesthetic or crutch or indeed the bombing of every single hospital 
 the minister say that he and his team be frustrate but give the partial application of international law and the government ’s unwillingness to take any significant step to either compel the imposition of a ceasefire or compliance with international law rather than be frustrate be he not ashamed that million of people in this country and around the world believe that there be an inherent racism at the heart of british foreign policy in this regard that say that palestinian life matter much less than any other life or indeed than israeli life and if he and the minister for development who have answer these statement before be ashamed why be they hang on to their red folder why be they not stand down and compelling the government actually to do something active and physical to save these life 
 there be place where i will take lesson about shame but it be not from the conservative benches and particularly not on this issue if they want to give i a hard time about what be be do in relation to the people in gaza they should turn to their own record whether that be on aid into gaza the icc or the icj these be sober issue and we deal with they with the sobriety they require and i would appreciate particularly from the conservative benches question of that tone 
 in november the israel defence forces make an official statement that they be get close to the complete evacuation of northern gaza and that palestinians will not be permit to return home in december doctor without borders report on the clear sign of ethnic cleansing in the north of gaza only last week the resident of beit hanan be order to leave the area ethnic cleansing be take place before our very eye and the world remain silent will the minister confirm that israel must allow palestinians to return to northern gaza and that any settlement there would be illegal 
 i can confirm that it be the view of the government that palestinians must be able to travel freely between north and south gaza that there can be no further illegal settlement and that we will continue to condemn that in the way we do in the west bank there must be no annexation of gaza 
 do the government acknowledge that what be happen in northern gaza be a campaign of ethnic cleansing if the minister do not what would he call it 
 we have be incredibly clear about the position in northern gaza and about our deep concern in relation to healthcare provision aid go into the area the targeting of healthcare professional the detention the importance of transparency where people have be take ensure that they have adequate right to see their lawyer and that the icrc can see people the situation in northern gaza be close to our mind we have comment extensively throughout the winter period and we will continue to do so 
 have listen to evidence on gaza as a member of the international development committee it be clear to i that there have be egregious breach of international law while i do not doubt the integrity and sincerity of   my hon friend it be clear that the action take so far by the government have either not shift the dial an inch or make i question how much bad it would be besides rhetorically support an international court what will the government do to help gather evidence to protect witness and ensure that there be justice and accountability 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question although i take issue with it this government have do more than rhetoric whether it be the £ of funding we announce in december the £ of funding for the occupied palestinian territories the quite different position we have take on question of international justice compare with our predecessor or the extensive funding we provide to the icc each year to ensure that it can do its work i want to be clear that we do not specify that the funding be in relation to gaza we give it so that the icc can pursue its work without fear or favour globally and we will continue to do so 
 the aggressor in this situation be the terrorist in hamas the one who take and continue to hold hostage be the terrorist in hamas do the minister therefore agree that the only concrete way to end this horror be for those terrorist in hamas to release the remain hostage and that talk of an unconditional ceasefire give those terrorist no incentive to free those innocent people 
 hamas be terrorist and they should release the hostage immediately 
 there be an estimate pregnant woman in gaza with more than birth take place every day none of we can imagine the hell of gaza let alone be pregnant in it ultimately we need a ceasefire but the health system be on its knee will the minister expand on whether he have specifically raise the issue of woman and girl and how our aid be be target to support access to sexual and reproductive health service 
 we have raise those issue specifically but i want to be straightforward with the house we be clear that insufficient aid of all kind be get into gaza on almost any question that the house might put to i there be insufficient aid insufficient equipment and insufficient provision for people to be exist in gaza under those condition and we will continue to raise that with force with the israelis for as long as that situation remain 
 exactly a year ago lord cameron when talk about the situation in northern gaza tell the foreign affairs committee that 
 the conflict be now effectively over there 
 unfortunately no seem to have tell tel aviv because baby be still freeze to death and the last hospital have be destroy in that year while the face on the government benches might have change the uk ’s complicity in the mass killing of palestinians remain as it have be give that nothing have change do the minister genuinely believe that in another year from now he will be able to say that continue to arm the idf be moral and legal 
 if word be to have meaning clearly our policy be different from that of those on the opposition benches as i think they would accept i do not want to see this conflict continue for another year the palestinians can not wait we be do everything we can we have be call for an immediate ceasefire since we come into government we will continue to take step to try to advance that call 
 i be leave numb by the word a doctor write on a whiteboard in the al awda hospital in gaza before he be kill by an israeli air strike which say 
 whoever stay until the end will tell the story we do what we could please remember we 
 we need to know that we do all we could i know the minister and his department be pull every lever available but please can we have an extra push to get the ceasefire deal over the line we need to put an end to this horror 
 i remember those word from the whiteboard and we must and will spare no effort and will strain every sinew to try to do what we can to advance the ceasefire as quickly as possible it be already far too late 
 i be pleased that the prime minister recently meet unrwa ’s commissioner general lazzarini and pledge further funding but in week legislation to ban unrwa will come into force lazzarini have say that 
 dismantle unrwa will collapse the united nations humanitarian response 
 in gaza and that the 
 entire population fear that their only remain lifeline will be cut 
 he also comment that 
 since the beginning of the war in gaza israeli official have describe dismantle unrwa as a war goal 
 will the minister set out what consequential step the uk will take if that come into effect 
 the prime minister be the prime minister to meet the commissioner general of unrwa he do so in a week when we have announce further funding for unrwa we have raise those vital question with the israeli government we do so over the course of the break i myself have meet commissioner general lazzarini and i will be say more about unrwa in the come week if we be not in a position to see that the israelis have take the action necessary to ensure the sustained and continued support that palestinians require and which only unrwa can provide 
 not single hospital now operate in northern gaza healthcare staff continue to be target result in the death of even more innocent civilian we have hear the minister but surely what we be do be not enough what can we do to stop the systemic dismantling of the hospital in gaza 
 my hon friend be right that what we have do be not enough and we know it be not enough because the provision be so poor in northern gaza we be distress by the scene in northern gaza and by the   circumstance that hon member have describe we will continue to work as hard as we can both in relation to unrwa and directly with the israeli government to try to ensure that the aid provision include medical provision be provide with urgency the current situation be not good enough 
 of course israel have the right to defend itself but surely the life of a palestinian child be as precious as the life of an israeli child and it be a breach of international humanitarian law for fuel food and energy to be cut off from ordinary palestinians will the minister confirm to the house that the uk government have an independent foreign policy on israel and gaza and that it be set in whitehall not in washington 
 britain have an independent foreign policy set by the foreign office ministers and the prime minister i be happy to confirm that to the house of course for this government the value of a palestinian life be exactly the same as that of an israeli life and we deplore all the civilian suffering that we have see in this conflict which as i say have go on for far too long 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker of the most appalling aspect of this conflict have be israel ’s reckless disregard not just for civilian life but for that of medical practitioner and patient kamal adwan hospital the last major facility in northern gaza be now out of service as member have say patient have be move to the nearby but non functional and partially destroy indonesian hospital and be unable to receive care because of a lack of necessary equipment and supply will the minister confirm that israel ’s action have clearly breach international law and that a consequence of that will be the continued suspension of weapon sale to israel when it come to gaza 
 we be follow the situation closely i raise the circumstance of those hospital with the deputy foreign minister on   december i confirm that all the development in the conflict be consider as part of the regular assessment process and contribute to the assessment that we make 
 report after report from reputable organisation the most recent be amnesty international have conclude that israel ’s action in gaza be genocidal in nature the scale of destruction in northern gaza have now be describe as much bad than that in the aftermath of hiroshima will the government change their position and identify that israel ’s action in gaza be indeed genocidal in nature and what action will be take give the grave nature of those fact 
 determination of genocide and war crime be properly matter for international court and as the house know there be an international court process on that question so i will not comment far on determination question the member ask about what we be do so let i recap again we have take action in relation to arm aid and diplomatic pressure on the israelis and we will continue to do so the situation in gaza be intolerable and we will continue to take step to try to reduce the suffering 
 i appreciate the difficult position that the minister be in he have speak a number of time in the house about this issue however i have significant sympathy for   the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse   and other who have express frustration now be the time for action i appreciate that we as a government have do a lot and be significantly different from the previous government but that be a very very low bar it be important that this house have its view express through ministers have the government finally accept the icj ’s advisory opinion which be absolutely crucial to the delivery of a state solution and a peace process 
 i be always happy to hear the house ’s view on these issue which i have hear and will continue to hear extensively and i know the strength of feeling across the house on the icj advisory opinion we be still consider what be a complex and far reach judgment with significant horizontal legal implication as well as in relation specifically to the conflict at the heart of that advisory opinion be a concern about the status of the occupied palestinian territories i be pleased to confirm that we continue to consider palestinian territory to be occupy we continue to take a position consistent with international law and we continue to condemn illegal settlement that be why we take tangible not just rhetorical step against violent and illegal settlement in the west bank 
 the minister must be aware that there be hon member on both side of the house who be equally as frustrated with the form of the previous administration as they be with this he say that he have bring pressure to bear on the israeli authority when that pressure manifestly fail to deliver be there a plan 
 i pay tribute to the right hon gentleman who be also a foreign office minister i once host he in afghanistan which i be sure he will not remember interruption i be sure that he remember afghanistan and have vivid memory of kabul at that time i mean that he might not remember i we raise those issue with force there be consequence for sustained breach of international humanitarian law but it would be inappropriate for i to comment in too much detail on how we conduct diplomatic relation on those question 
 i thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question and i thank my hon friend for all his hard work in these difficult situation member of the knesset have pen a letter to the israeli defence minister demand that israel destroy all source of water food and energy for palestinians in gaza they argue that israel should do to the rest of gaza what it have be do to the north will the government ban entry of those knesset member who be openly call for the extermination of palestinians in gaza 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and her kind word the house will be bore of hear i say it but we do not comment on sanction measure in advance of take they as do so would reduce their impact but i welcome the opportunity to make a brief comment on the proceeding of the knesset   there be much say in other parliaments with which we do not agree we be clear that obligation under international humanitarian law and diplomatic obligation fall on the israeli government we be clear with the israeli government on their obligation under international humanitarian law and we be clear about our policy position i will refrain from provide detailed commentary on the proceeding of another parliament 
 it be quite clear that israel ’s ability to destroy life in gaza kill people and to destroy medical facility be possible only because of the supply of weapon principally from the united states i ask the minister to be very clear will britain continue supply weapon include part for jet plane and allow the use of raf akrotiri as a route for weapon to go to israel to be use to destroy life in gaza 
 the right hon gentleman ask about fighter jet in relation to the f-35 supply chain where it be not possible to disentangle component that might eventually end up in israel we have make a carve out for the arm suspension where we have be directly sell fighter jet part to israel whether for f-35s or other fighter jet those licence have be suspend we will continue to have the same position on the f-35 supply chain we have discuss that at length in this house since it be announce in september but in relation to other fighter jet we will take step in accordance with wide policy 
 aid access be non existent for palestinians in north gaza over the past month the un have make over attempt to reach the civilian in north gaza with almost access and we have hear that baby have freeze to death in october the prime minister say that 
 the world will not tolerate any more excuse on humanitarian assistance
