 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department have take to support the delivery of youth service in deprive community 
 this government be co produce a national youth strategy the in decade to bring power back to young people no matter who they be or where they live i be really proud that we be directly invest over £ in youth programme across the country this year 
 as a young man who owe as much to youth theatre as to my schooling for give i the confidence to speak in this place i know the importance of youth service i be really pleased that the government have the well youth space fund which organisation in my constituency have be engage with and i hope that the government will look favourably at what come from bishop auckland the process have bring to light just how strip bare our youth service be and how few meet the threshold of youth service provision would the secretary of state or of her adviser meet i to discuss how we can ensure that we have the youth worker in order to actually bid for the fund in the place 
 we have to take the difficult decision to focus the well youth space funding on organisation whose main aim be support young people my hon friend be right to point to the absolutely dire state of youth service that we inherit a pound be take out of youth service under the last government and thousand of youth worker and hundred of youth   club be lose up and down the country our forthcoming national youth strategy will put youth worker and youth club at the heart of those plan and we will invest 
 local charity would be well equip to deliver youth service if they could maximise their income from source such as the people ’s postcode lottery but in spring the government refuse to make the reform that would enable more money to be available for good cause despite support it in opposition give that this decision have prove quite controversial will the government agree to revisit it 
 we have hear concern from across the house on this issue and the youth minister my hon friend   the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock would be happy to meet with the hon lady to discuss it 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 we all recognise the value of youth service but the right hon lady will be well aware that many youth service from mental health support to sport provision be commission and then provide by charity which be under quite severe financial pressure yet incredibly charity be not exempt from labour ’s national insurance increase even child ’s hospice be not why not be the department engage constructively with the chancellor about the plight of child ’s and youth charity there be no point have a youth strategy if the government be undermine the viability of the provider of the service 
 of all i welcome the shadow secretary of state to his place and thank he for the very constructive way that he engage with colleague from across the house as sports minister include i i hope that be a model we can replicate 
 i really do recognise the centrality of charity to everything we be try to do as a country the shadow secretary of state will know that my background at the centrepoint charity and then the children ’s society be what lead i into this place on his specific issue we have protect the small charity which will be well off as a consequence of our reform we have also ensure that the majority will pay either the same or less we do recognise the challenge however and my hon friend the minister for civil society have be work through those issue with charity as part of our work with the civil society covenant 
 what step she be take to help protect creative copyright in the context of further advance in ai 
 the secretary of state for science innovation and technology and i have be work with representative from the creative industry and major tech company to ensure that we have a copyright regime that be fit for purpose but our message be clear to speak directly to the hon member ’s concern and that   of many other member of this house if it do not work for creative it will not work for we and we will not do it 
 daisy may johnson be an exceptionally talented author of child ’s book in york but her work have be scrap and reproduce by generative artificial intelligence she have not give permission and have not receive a penny but she have lose thousand of pound the same can be say about artist musician writer and other creative when the data use and access act be go through this house we be give a commitment that the government would do more so could the minister set out what progress have be make and ensure that there be legislation on this in the next session 
 i really appreciate the urgency of this issue the example of daisy from the hon member ’s constituency be similar to example from many other member as a labour government we obviously believe strongly that people must be fairly pay for their work which be why we have put transparency and remuneration at the heart of the principle that will govern our approach like i say we have make progress with the expert working group and we will be able to announce the detail shortly we be also establish a parliamentary working group which i very much hope the hon member will participate in to make sure that we hear the view of people from across the country through their mp i will be able to deliver a statement to the house by the end of this year on the future of the copyright framework 
 the government continue their haphazard approach to artificial intelligence and copyright i wish they would get that resolve thing that have concern and upset the sector be the comment of a newly appoint special adviser to the secretary of state for science innovation and technology who say 
 whether or not you philosophically believe the big ai firm should compensate content creator they in practice will never legally have to 
 i be really hop that the secretary of state distance herself from those comment and that that be not the intention of her government 
 i be happy to give the hon gentleman that assurance that be not the government ’s intention he say that there have be a haphazard approach actually no country in the world have yet manage to resolve this matter we appreciate the urgency and we be determined to address this and become the gold standard the creative industry be at the centre of our industrial strategy for a reason because we know that they lead and light up the world whatever ai model develop in future human good quality content will be at the heart of that we have to and will protect it and i be happy to give he that assurance 
 what step she be take to support grassroots music venue 
 as someone who use to manage a local band call squeezebox when at university available at all bad record store i understand that grassroots music be the lifeblood of the music industry the government have commit to support the live music industry ’s introduction of a voluntary levy on ticket for stadium and arena show and that money will be plough straight into the grassroots music sector the government be provide up to £ for the music growth package which will provide further government support to grassroots venue by foster domestic growth talent development and music export 
 grassroots music venue across the country particularly across london be find it increasingly difficult to survive as customer be spend less when they come to gig because of the cost of living crisis will the minister explain the progress on the levy will he consider the lib dem call to reverse the national insurance rise on small business to give venue such as the sound lounge and the cryerarts centre in sutton which be so value by our local community the good chance to survive and thrive 
 the hon gentleman lay out the difficulty of which there be many for the live music sector and potentially the venue many of they in his constituency we want to see of all ticket sale for stadium and arena show in enter that music levy that be this government ’s aspiration and we encourage all ticket provider to do so in the autumn budget as he suggest the chancellor set out plan to transform the business rate system over this parliament those reform will provide certainty and support to business include music venue the government have be engage with the live music sector on business rate reform and will set out further policy detail in next month ’s budget 
 i call the liberal democrats spokesperson

 let i correct the record i do not say that i be a musician i say that i manage a band i would not like that to be incorrectly record in hansard in any case i thank the hon lady for the encouragement 
 this matter be a priority for this government to try and resolve it be mention in the uk eu reset summit agreement we be work hard with the paymaster general who take forward those negotiation i be already in touch with the european commissioner for culture i can assure the hon lady that we will do everything we possibly can to get the agreement and the commitment over the line

 as well as congratulate mclaren which be base in my constituency of woking for win the formula constructor title for the season in a row will the minister also agree to ask the chancellor to change the tax on sustainable fuel so that this country can continue to have a lead place in the motoring industry 
 i would of course like to congratulate mclaren on back to back formula constructor championship victory and i be sure the support it receive in woking be no small part of that alongside the secretary of state i attend the british grand prix in the summer and witness mclaren and britain ’s own lando norris claim victory my department will continue to stay in close contact with formula and i will reflect his comment to the chancellor 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of provide additional funding to support tourism in area affect by major energy infrastructure project 
 the government be commit to support the visitor economy in rural and coastal community because we recognise the potential the sector have to contribute to economic growth and to the pride in place of an area through ongoing dialogue with other departments and ministers we be explore how good to support community and business include through our forthcoming visitor economy growth plan 
 suffolk coastal be proud to be the tourism capital of suffolk but we also wear the badge of host possibly the high number of nationally significant infrastructure project within a small mile radius suffolk coastal be home to aldeburgh southwold woodbridge and saxmundham and every day i speak to business and constituent about the impact of the lack of co ordination of these nsips in a very small geography invest in energy infrastructure and tourism do not need to be in conflict be the minister have conversation with the department for energy security and net about how we can well co ordinate if she be not will she 
 i recognise how important the tourism and hospitality sector be to suffolk and i know that my hon friend be a strong champion for they and for her area the department for culture media and sport work closely with other department include desnz and the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that the need of the visitor economy be consider as part of the planning and delivery of large scale project the government acknowledge concern that numerous project may be consent to in region and the cumulative impact of scheme be consider as they move individually through the nsip regime i will reflect her comment to mhclg but of course such large infrastructure project be important for the country 
 my constituency have the large number of wind turbine either construct or consent to do the minister share my concern that the scottish government continue to override the view of local council and local community in consent to further project that be to the detriment of the landscape and therefore the local tourist industry 
 i have hear the right hon gentleman ’s point i be sure that the relevant secretary of state and indeed the scottish government have hear it i would be happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 if she will have discussion with the coal industry social welfare organisation on its role in support coalmine community 
 i know from my own experience from member across the house and from my constituent of the deep unhappiness with ciswo as charities minister i meet representative of the charity commission to discuss ciswo ’s support for coal mining community and i know the commission be in contact with ciswo i encourage the chief executive officer and trustee to reflect on how they deliver their charitable purpose in the light of the dissatisfaction express by hon member and local community and i strongly encourage ciswo to strengthen its engagement with the local coalfield community that it be establish to support 
 the coal industry social welfare organisation date back to the 1920s its main function then and its main function now be to support the mining community but sadly many mining mp be witness exactly the opposite the chief executive officer ’s rigid enforcement of decade old covenant and dogged intransigence be work against our mining community in my patch of blyth and ashington the eviction of the bedlington terriers from a ground they have play on for more than year be a prime example the trustee believe themselves to be untouchable and have tret the coalfield mps with the utmost contempt will the minister agree to meet i and the chair of the coalfield group to discuss how together we can reverse the current mindset of the ciswo trustee and reflect the real need of the people in our mining community 
 i understand my hon friend ’s grave concern which be reflect across our coalfield community i be deeply troubled to hear the example he share with the house charity must stay true to their charitable purpose and act within the law and the term of their governing document where they fail to do so it be right that we have the charity commission as the independent regulator to investigate i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss his concern in more detail that invitation be open to any member of the house as it be clear to i that concern regard ciswo be sincerely hold i once again reiterate my encouragement for the ceo and trustee to reflect on how they deliver their charitable purpose for the coalfield community they be mean to represent 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on level of funding for youth service 
 we will soon be launch our national youth strategy create with young people and design to tackle the problem affect they as part of that work we engage regularly with cabinet colleague on ensure that the problem impact young people be hear and properly tackle this financial year dcms be invest over £ in youth funding 
 i welcome the government ’s work on the national youth strategy and their investment in youth service so far how do they expect the move away from a size fit all approach to benefit young people from different background in my constituency and in general 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for all her work in our youth strategy we will set out the next step to invest in the future of our young people we want to well co ordinate youth service and move away from a size fit all approach from central government in short we want to put power back in the hand of young people and their community 
 youth service deliver huge benefit to our community both socially and economically reduce knife crime and antisocial behaviour and in turn save the country £ a year yet the club that i meet in my constituency include wesley hall youth club and eyres monsell club for young people tell i that there be a real recruitment and retention crisis in the sector with over worker leave in the past decade what measure be the minister take to address this issue 
 the hon member be absolutely right to outline the importance of youth service particularly in the prevention of knife crime and other issue of course we see a reduction in real term spend over the last year under the conservative government we will not be able to reverse that overnight but that be why we look forward to our youth strategy which will be publish by the end of the year 
 what recent discussion she have have with relevant stakeholder on the potential impact of change to the list place of worship grant scheme on list place of worship 
 on this issue the secretary of state meet my hon friend   the member for battersea marsha de cordova   in her role as the church estates commissioner and my right hon friend   the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry in march my noble friend the minister for heritage meet the right reverend prelate the bishop of bristol my noble friend lord khan of burnley my hon friend the member for battersea and church representative as well as visit salisbury cathedral and st michael le belfrey in york 
 i be grateful for the minister ’s answer but i be not sure the government have understand the level of uncertainty and panic that have set in follow their approach to this grant scheme some of the most cherished building in our constituency be wait on clarity for when the government will come forward with concrete step to extend this scheme what will happen after march i would be grateful if the minister could give we that clarity now 
 this be an incredibly serious issue but the conservatives do not allocate any funding for it at all when they be in government and therefore we be leave with the current situation i reiterate to those who may wish to use the list place of worship grant scheme that £ be leave in that scheme grant be cap at £ but the analysis from the department be that of all application be unaffected by this change because most claim be under £ there be plenty of money leave in the pot for this year and i would encourage they to use it 
 what step her department plan to take to help increase access to grassroots sport facility 
 we believe in the power of grassroots sport which be why we announce investment of £ in future grassroots facility but we be go far than that and insist that girl will have equal access to any facility that we fund because girl belong on the pitch i take this moment to pay tribute to the lionesses and the red roses on their incredible victory in the woman ’s euros and the rugby world cup it be a particular pleasure to join   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson   to cheer on the red roses we want all girl to grow up not just with dream of be able to match those ambition but with a real plan 
 access to sport be vital for not only our public health but foster a sense of community and reduce antisocial behaviour yet in st austell many   of the astroturf facility such as the great at penrice school can not be use after dark because they lack floodlight will the minister look at how small scale investment of this kind in vital community facility could help unlock all year round access to physical activity for people of all age 
 i thank my hon friend for be an outstanding champion for sport in his community i would encourage penrice school and other who have similar challenge to approach the football foundation through which we fund floodlight and other small scale investment previous funding allocation have be far too prescriptive we believe community know well what they need and through the football foundation we be determined to deliver it 
 i call the chair of the culture media and sport committee 
 early this week the committee hear from henry hughes and nathan young brilliant swimmer who be travel to tokyo next month to represent britain as part of the deaflympics the competition have be run for over year long than the paralympics in fact but deaf athlete be the only disabled elite sport group who have no access to either government or uk sport funding will the secretary of state join i in wish all our deaf olympian the very good of luck in tokyo next month will she also agree to meet they on their return with uk deaf sport to discuss how this terrible situation can be improve and how they can be support much well in the future

 i call the shadow minister 
 this have be an incredible year for woman ’s sport with both the lionesses and the red roses inspire a generation with their fantastic performance and historic success on the pitch the previous conservative government work in partnership alongside the national lottery sport england and various national body to help to support these incredible athlete with investment in grassroots facility include the £ lionesses fund which directly increase opportunity for woman ’s and girl sport beyond the sentiment that the secretary of state have already express today will she confirm whether her government will support a new lionesses and red roses fund specifically for woman ’s sport will she also confirm that fairness and safety will remain the key pillar of guidance for female sport 
 it be a real pleasure with the prime minister to meet the lionesses before they go off and then on to victory in the euros we have be work closely with rugby football and other area of woman ’s   sport to advance this issue the £ investment that i reference in answer to my hon friend   the member for st austell and newquay noah law   will double the number of place across the board which will mean a significant increase in the number of woman and girl able to access sport my hon friend the minister for sport be pleased to launch the woman ’s sport taskforce which will really grip this issue i be happy to work cross party on that it be something that the whole house should be able to get behind and support 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer hopefully she can pick up the point about fairness and safety in woman ’s sport in her next answer because that be also part of the question 
 the secretary of state will be aware that alongside investment from government and national sport body voluntary donation and corporate sponsorship play a key role in fund our grassroot and professional sport club and league for example flutter ’s cash4clubs programme have invest £ in grassroots club since do the minister therefore share my concern that the chancellor ’s propose race tax will not only see thousand of british job lose across the country but damage key sponsorship of a number of uk sport especially british horseracing will she confirm that her department have make it clear to the treasury that it oppose this tax raid on our british sport 
 i absolutely recognise the point about fairness and safety and i have have representation and conversation with many woman athlete and competitor since take office of course we want to be as inclusive as possible in the approach that we take but we recognise that fairness and safety really matter and we have be support the sporting body in deal with that it be a matter for they but we stand ready to support

 what step she be take to ensure that local authority fulfil their statutory duty in the delivery of youth service 
 local authority play a vital role in deliver youth service and have a statutory duty to provide sufficient leisure time activity and facility in line with local need this government inherit local authority that be on their knee and in that context some be struggle to meet their duty that be why as part of our wide investment in young people we be invest over £ this year to support local authority 
 i know the minister will join i in welcome the recent £ investment to improve the offer for young people in stoke on trent with the upcoming review of arm ’s length body such as sport england and the arts council will the minister ensure that great collaboration will mean that our young people always have somewhere to go and something to do on their weekend their evening and during their school holiday 
 of course i welcome this investment through the local youth transformation pilot which will support pathfinder local authority to start to rebuild a high quality offer for young people we want to see great co operation and co ordination so i join my hon friend in welcome that investment it be really important that young people have something positive to do during their evening and weekend and i have see that in my own area of barnsley where for example the barnsley youth choir support hundred of young people have attend their concert on saturday i wish they well in compete in spain this week

 however there be area of disagreement include this government ’s anti business attitude and policy increase national insurance and business rate have cause untold damage to swathe of dcms sector will the secretary of state therefore support the conservative policy of business rate relief on the retail hospitality and leisure sector at the very least can she assure i that she be beg and plead with the chancellor not to do any more damage to those sector in the upcoming budget 
 i thank the hon member for his warm word however it take some brass neck to represent a political party in this chamber that in recent memory crash the economy and leave work people across the country pay the price the demand for charity soar as a direct result of the conservatives policy while the ability of charity to stand up and speak up for the people they represent be attack and undermine at every turn by his government i can confirm that we will not be follow conservative policy we will be proudly fly the flag for labour policy which put people and community back at the heart of our country again 
 community in my constituency have be devastate by the destruction of shotley park a grade ii list building in a recent fire i understand that an investigation be go on into the circumstance but can the minister say in more general term what step we can take to protect our list building and the memory they represent for local people

 this government have waste no time in take action to increase the amount of support available to the minority of people for whom gambling become a problem as i say to   the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french gambling bring joy to million of people and it be an incredibly important part of the uk economy but we be determined to ensure that support be there for that minority of people that be why we waste no time in introduce a levy that be help to boost such support particularly for young people we be happy to continue the conversation with member from across the house to ensure that we tackle this important issue but on the specific proposal that the hon lady make we have no plan to introduce such a measure

 what assessment the church of england have make of the effectiveness of the government ’s policy on support freedom of religion or belief in other country 
 the prime minister ’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief launch the government ’s new strategy on   july   this year and the church welcome that continue commitment obviously it be too early to assess the effectiveness of the strategy but the church remain concerned about the global and local trend the level across country be currently either high or very high and government restriction on freedom of religion or belief be at their high level since

 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster if he will make a statement on the witness statement in relation to the allege breach of the official secrets act on behalf of china 
 i thank the hon member for the question and for the opportunity to respond to it today i appreciate how serious and personal this be for the hon member who like other member of this house be sanction by china and/or name in the witness statement 
 follow the security minister ’s statement to the house on monday the prime minister update parliament yesterday follow the crown prosecution service ’s clarification that the government be able to publish the witness statement of the deputy national security adviser as the prime minister say in the house he carefully consider this matter and follow legal advice decide to disclose the witness statement unredacted and in full 
 i reiterate that as the prime minister say yesterday under this government no minister or special adviser play any role in the provision of evidence the prime minister can not say whether that be the case under the previous government but i once again invite the conservative party to clarify that 
 stop play politic this be about national security you petty little man 
 have now have the opportunity to read these statement member will have be able to confirm for themselves what the prime minister and other member of the government 
 order may i just say—[interruption no you be go to hear it whether you like it or not mr tugendhat i expect well from you you will be want to catch my eye and this be not the good way to do it can we please show a little bit more respect which i normally get from you 
 thank you mr speaker 
 have now have the opportunity to read the statement member will be able to confirm for themselves what the prime minister and other member of the government have state repeatedly the dnsa faithfully and with full integrity set out the position of the previous uk government and the various threat pose by the chinese state to the uk and do so in order to try to support a successful prosecution 
 the and most substantive witness statement be from december under the last government the and which be both much short be from february and august respectively it be clear from these statement that the substantive case and evidence submit by the dnsa do not change materially throughout and that all document clearly articulate the very serious threat pose by china the witness statement in particular highlight   the specific detail of some of the cyber threat that we face and emphasise that china be the big state base threat to the uk ’s national security the statement go on to state that the chinese intelligence service be 
 highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operation against the uk to advance the chinese state ’s interest and harm the security of the uk 
 it be clear from this evidence which all can now see that the dnsa take significant stride to articulate the threat from china in support of the prosecution the decision on whether to proceed as the prime minister make clear yesterday be take purely by the cps it be also clear that the statement be constrain by the position of the conservative government on china at the time of the alleged offence 
 as the prime minister say yesterday and the security minister say on monday this government ’s priority will always be national security and keep this country safe we want this case to proceed i be sure all member of the house do and i know you do too mr speaker we be all profoundly disappointed that it do not 
 i should declare an interest as i be name in the witness statement as someone sanction by china i be shocked to learn that the prime minister know that this case be about to collapse several day beforehand but choose to do nothing we now know that the cps be not far short of what it need the director of public prosecutions tell mps yesterday that it be something like short however we do not know exactly what the cps be ask for what that be we do not know why the government would not go that bit far when they be ask to that be what we need hear from the minister today why do the government not give the cps what it be ask for 
 nobody be dispute that there be plenty of evidence the witness statement be shocking they tell we that china be conduct large scale espionage operation cash be say to have tell berry in a message 
 you ’re in spy territory now 
 yesterday government source brief the guardian that the civil service decide that decision 
 should be do independently of minister 
 no no no mr speaker the civil service do not get to decide anything minister decide the prime minister be not some helpless captive unable to make sure that the cps have what it need he know and he decide not to help why 
 let we come back to the evidence that be provide the prime minister say yesterday that he be utterly constrain by the position of the previous government and every expert have already contradict the pm on this however we can now see that the witness statement from this year do state the position of the current labour government a direct contradiction of what the prime minister say yesterday the evidence include line from labour ’s manifesto and they weaken the case they make it less clear that china be a threat to our national security that be of the thing that change 
 the sunday times report on a meeting convene by jonathan powell with the permanent secretary of the foreign office to discuss this case until yesterday the   government say that that be just make up now they admit that it happen but they still will not come clean about what happen in that meeting or any other meeting 
 in conclusion this house need to know what be ask for by the cps and why it be refuse and we must see all the correspondence and the minute if the government will not publish the china file people will ask what have this government get to hide 
 i thank the shadow minister for that and as i say i do recognise how personally important this matter be to he and to many member of the house 
 on transparency the security minister have give statement to this house the prime minister give what i think we can all agree be a rather lengthy statement yesterday and he use the pretty unusual process of publish the evidence in full yesterday so transparency be something the government be try to provide 
 the key point the shadow minister make be about why the prime minister or ministers do not interfere or try to do so as the prime minister make clear yesterday this be a matter for the cps independently and an important principle of this government—[interruption evidence be provide independently by the deputy national security adviser the prime minister make it clear and this be the bit i find confusing—[interruption 
 order mr cartlidge you be very energetic there and even i can hear you from here so please can we have a little bit less 
 this be the bit that i find slightly confusing about the opposition ’s approach on monday and today as well they have accuse this government of political interference include by the national security adviser the prime minister have make it absolutely clear that that be completely untrue on the other hand they be say there should have be political interference and that the prime minister should have direct or try to help the cps the prime minister have make it very clear that that be not the case and that no prime minister and no government would interfere with the cps on a decision to charge which be entirely for it to make 
 in term of the evidence in the statement put forward yesterday there be clear consistency across they they all set out the very very serious threat that china pose i do not think anyone can think that that be not the case interruption it be provide independently by the deputy national security adviser without interference from anyone else they be his word it be his choice what happen and that be what happen 
 we have be through this several time on monday yesterday and today the prime minister have provide the evidence it be there for ministers and members to see ultimately the decision be take by the cps not to proceed and we be all disappointed in that 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 it seem to i that the issue be this give that all the deputy nsa ’s witness statement refer to china as a threat i can not understand why the cps take the nuclear option of collapse the case rather than leave   it to a jury year as a criminal barrister have give i absolute faith that the jury would have spend no time on how many angel can dance on the top of a pin but would simply have look at whether or not china be an enemy they would have find it very easy to decide that that be exactly what it be and then move on to whether or not these man have be spy on behalf of china it do seem to i that the decision should have be leave to a jury do my hon friend have any idea why on earth the cps drop the case 
 as i say this be a decision take by the cps independently with no interference or involvement from the government member may or may not sympathise with that decision it be a cps decision that be why it be important that the evidence be in the public domain now and that everyone can judge from that how thing proceed 
 i will just make final point obviously the cps decision be not base purely on the evidence put forward by the dnsa it be base on much wide evidence collect over a much long period so the decision on whether to proceed be take by the cps on a much broad evidential basis 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday we see finger pointing and gotcha moment from both the government and the opposition benches during prime minister ’s question but the release of the witness statement last night provide further question for both side include what pressure be be apply to   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat   and   the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns   from within their own party to dampen down their criticism of china this whole thing make an absolutely mockery of what be a serious collapse of a case and a threat to our national security a threat that be not go away but will only increase 
 do the cps tell the government in advance that the case be at risk of collapse do it ask the government to be more explicit in their wording and if so why be the government not more explicit will the minister commit today to a statutory independent inquiry which would provide radical transparency and ensure that the right lesson be learn so that this do not happen again 
 i can promise that i will try to avoid all gotcha moment and finger pointing on the question of when the cps inform the government my understanding and the prime minister make this clear yesterday be that the prime minister be inform very shortly before the case collapse a matter of day before that be on the record it be in the house if you need to refer to that from the prime minister 
 in term of future inquiry i should have say to my right hon friend   the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry   that this be an issue select committees will want to look at as well there be a normal process for that but i be unable to go beyond that today 
 i call the chair of the joint committee on the national security strategy 
 i be pleased that the government publish the witness statement last night but clearly there be a lot of question yet to be ask in term of how this come about and what evidence there be that may not have be share or perhaps be not ask for the joint committee meet this morning to discuss the situation we will hold a formal inquiry into the issue just to remind members the committee comprise the chair of the foreign affairs committee the home affairs committee and the justice committee so we be well cover we will be hold the inquiry as soon as we possibly can will the minister give his commitment that we will have access to ministers civil servant and whoever we wish to come before we 
 as i say parliamentary scrutiny and transparency be something that despite the allegation we be try to provide with statement and by publish evidence i be sure go forward that that be something that will carry on i will come back to my hon friend on the precise mechanism for how we will do that but i be sure people will be make available to his committee 
 i call the father of the house 
 obviously this be too important for party politic it be a matter of national security against an existential threat from china the prime minister be clear yesterday when he say that no minister would ever apply pressure to the cps and i completely believe he but we would like to have clarity that ministers have no discussion with civil servant and then subsequently civil servant with the cps we want to be absolutely clear that there be no ministerial involvement at all 
 that be absolutely my understanding 
 paragraph of the   august   statement say 
 it be important for i to emphasise that the uk government be commit to pursue a positive relationship with china to strengthen understanding cooperation and stability 
 why do the deputy national security adviser think it be a good idea to include that in the statement 
 the deputy national security adviser be reflect government policy at the time that be his choice of word and it be his decision to include that but if we look across the statement we see there be broad consistency and no material difference on the policy relate to china which have be pretty much share across the house 
 it be now clear that the crown prosecution service ask the government more than once over more than a year for some additional evidence on what the cps consider to be the crucial question of whether china constitute a national security threat during the relevant period it seem to i have read those statement that at least important question arise 
 the be the just ask by   the hon member for widnes and halewood derek twigg give that it be clear at the point when the deputy national security   adviser make his and statement that the question he be be ask to comment on be whether that bar of be a national security threat be meet or not what be the possible relevance of the inclusion of information about china as an economic opportunity surely the minister and the government can see that that only weaken the substance of the question that that witness be be ask to answer it would be useful to understand whether the dnsa come to that view on his own or have it suggest to he that that would be a useful thing to include 
 the question be this the government have be clear the minister have be today and the prime minister be yesterday about how disappointed they be at the outcome of the trial and how much they want the prosecution to proceed give the length of time and the number of request receive by the cps surely it would be logical to assume that the government would be strain every sinew to find extra evidence to meet the cps ’s requirement whether they think the cps be right to ask for it or not it be clear that with that extra evidence the cps would have proceed with the case as the government say they want what evidence can the government provide to we that every sinew be strained and that they do everything they could to find that evidence if that evidence be in fact available and other could find it will the government not have some explain to do 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman for the tone of his question on the point—[interruption i be so sorry will he remind i what that be 
 the question be about why the deputy national security adviser include reference to economic opportunity in his statement when he know that that be not the question he be be ask nor the relevant question 
 i be so sorry i thank the right hon and learn gentleman that be do to provide broad context of the government ’s position on china at the time but it be an independent decision take freely without interference from ministers or adviser of the dsna to do so interruption it be not my position to account for that that be his decision and that be the evidence submit under consecutive government i be afraid that be all i can add on that point 
 may i take the minister back to the wording of the act it say that it be an offence to pass information that would be 
 directly or indirectly useful to an enemy 
 it do not say that it be an offence to directly or indirectly pass to an enemy information that would be useful the difference be that in the it be the usefulness of the information that constitute the offence it might be pass to any unauthorised person in the it be the passing of it to an enemy that constitute the offence by use the interpretation it be therefore possible to argue that unless the person the information be pass to be an enemy no offence be commit that it would seem to i be how the man have the case drop in fact by pass it to a person not authorise to receive it friend or foe they have allow   it to circulate outside of the uk government ’s control where it could then be obtain and use by an enemy surely that be what the act seek to criminalise if the minister agree be he satisfied that the wording of the act be as it should be or do he think that the prosecution be drop erroneously 
 comment on whether or not it be drop erroneously be not something that any minister would do from this dispatch box 
 i would like to make a broad point about china ’s activity in the united kingdom relate to this the application for the super embassy be currently on the government ’s desk as the minister say and have be acknowledge china be a threat and be actively work to undermine our national security the secretary of state for housing communities and local government say that the government 
 would never compromise national security 
 how can the government give any consideration to approve the chinese super embassy which would give extraordinary capability to china to continue to expand its espionage activity and to target hongkonger on british soil with its transnational repression 
 as the hon gentleman say the decision on the chinese embassy will be take by the secretary of state for housing communities and local government in due course it be completely unrelated to this case and anything in it that be an important point to reiterate 
 i thank the minister for his response so far on this important matter i want to draw his attention to sub paragraph d of paragraph of the deputy national security adviser ’s initial witness statement in which he reference newport wafer fab as it be call in do the minister share my concern that the wafer fab sale could have be adversely affect by this leak of private information thus jeopardise the livelihood of good people in my constituency and what can he say to reassure i and other that this can not happen again 
 i can understand how seriously my hon friend and her constituent will take this if she will permit i i will get back to she with a substantive answer on that from the team as soon as i can 
 may i apologise for early outburst mr speaker interruption 
 order i be not in the position of need any advice or help i have have enough from the opposition benches i do not want it start on the government benches too i think we will take it that there be in fairness an apology to those on the front bench 
 may i start by say briefly quite how this feel mr speaker my home have be break into my file have be ransack somebody be put into my office by a hostile state and the party be play politic with it this be the national security of the united kingdom the people of tonbridge elect   i they may have choose wrong but they do the people of other part of the united kingdom choose everybody else in this house it be up to they to choose who represent they yet here we have individual seek to extract information from we and the government ’s response be not as mine be do everything you can to make sure the prosecution work no no it be process process well who the hell ’s side be you on this be not about bureaucracy this be about leadership we be not send here to be civil servant we be send here to lead the country and to make decision 
 i feel nothing but fondness for the minister in his place and i be very sorry that he have be send out on what be not quite his outing but pretty close—[interruption oh it be his outing he have be send out on his outing to defend the indefensible he now have the position in which he effectively have to say that he be not a politician but a bureaucrat that there be nothing he can do and that frankly he should not even be here in the place because that seem to be the prime minister ’s line former attorneys general have get up and prosecute on the state ’s behalf this attorney general and this prime minister have say not on my watch not worth the effort 
 just to say i have huge respect for the right hon member even if that evidently be not mutual at the moment let we see if we can get to that place 
 the prime minister answer this question yesterday i fully appreciate how personally this affect the right hon member his constituency and his office i do understand that and i be genuinely not try to play politic i see his eyebrow raise at that but i be genuinely not i be try to tell the story of how this situation have progress and to reiterate from the dispatch box the point that the prime minister make yesterday and the security minister make on monday which be that the government ’s position as it have be under successive government but particularly under this prime minister be that there will be no interference with the cps in the process of this and that every effort be make to try to deliver evidence to support its case when it be ask for 
 as   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat   emphasise so emphatically across the whole house we be appal by the action of the chinese state i want to go back to the precise law under which the charge be bring the act be introduce in and the conservatives set out to review it when they be in government in but they do not successfully replace with a law that be fit for purpose until year later have the conservatives get on with the job and replace the law more quickly would we be in a different position now 
 my hon friend invite i to play party politic and i have promise several time that i be not go to do that factually it be true that if the espionage act have be update more quickly and the current act have be in place at the time the case would have be able to proceed that be the case decision be take not to do that and i think that be greatly regrettable 
 i welcome the minister to his place on his outing i have to say i think the prime minister owe he a   favour the minister will understand the need for absolutely clarity and i know he say that but give the serious threat that he have say china pose to we can he be absolutely clear on issue that there be no ministerial involvement whatsoever in pull this case and secondly that the government provide all evidence that they be ask for i be afraid that just say it be my understanding be not good enough we need some assurance 
 the answer be yes to both 
 give that the deputy national security adviser be a civil servant and therefore accountable who be hold he to account for the job that he be do may i just emphasise that i be sure he be do his level and honourable well in the circumstance in which he find himself but it be really beyond belief that as become apparent from the inquiry where the director of public prosecutions be ask for a clear statement that china be a national security threat nobody be capable of tell he well actually you ’d well say that the idea that he be somehow beyond any influence from anybody be laughable can only conclude that this conspiracy of omission be something that the government want because they do not want this trial to go ahead 
 no that be really not the case people who have work with the dnsa will know that he be of the high calibre and integrity on this matter he present evidence under successive government on this devoid of any influence from adviser or government on this side i can not say if that be the case under the previous government but i be sure it be he present that evidence freely and to the good of his ability under successive government 
 leader should delegate responsibility but not accountability the argument at prime minister ’s question yesterday revolve around whether a minister or a special adviser have influence the collapse of the case and it be establish that neither ministers nor special adviser have involvement in the provision of evidence but do the minister think it would have be worth ministers reflect on the intelligence and security committee ’s china report and request sight of the witness statement provide by the senior civil servant before they be submit in essence have the government seek to delegate to a civil servant responsibility and accountability 
 no it be not the position of the government or of successive government to vet witness statement make in such case the hon gentleman will correct i if i be wrong but i think that be what he be ask across the witness statement the deputy national security adviser set out—15 or time i can not remember the exact number clearly and consistently the very serious threat that china pose on the basis of that the decision not to prosecute be take by the cps 
 i be slightly baffle by the answer that it be not the job of ministers to vet witness statement when they be make on behalf of the government that be exactly the point they be accountable the prime minister say that the evidence that be relevant to the case be the previous government ’s china policy but the statement publish last night show that they be change to reflect this government ’s china policy that be not the only way in which the prime minister ’s story have fall apart but on that specific point what he tell the house be not correct be it 
 it be there be no political interference from the government in any of the statement make interruption it do not matter how many time hon member allege it it be not the case 
 among all the noise of this china spy scandal my constituent in boston and skegness and the whole british people want some clarity from the government do they view china as a national security threat yes or no 
 throughout the evidence the threat that china pose be set out multiple time there be complete consistency between the obviously there be very serious threat i have read they out in my statement 
 the deputy national security adviser be clear in his evidence that china be the great state economic threat to the uk do the minister agree with that be he seriously try to suggest that the deputy national security adviser give what he have say in his evidence do not clear what he be do with the cps with his superior jonathan powell or ministers 
 yes that be exactly what i be say the prime minister say yesterday and the security minister say on monday 
 notwithstanding the decision to drop this case it be clear that china be try to undermine our democracy will the government include all chinese official hong kong special administrative region official and chinese communist party link organisation on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme 
 i be afraid that i be not across the specific of that in my brief so i will get back to the hon lady 
 the minister know the prime minister well have be of his close adviser as well as his parliamentary private secretary why when he learn that a major trial concern spy on members be go to collapse do the prime minister do nothing why do he not ask if anything could be do to stop the trial collapse be that what he want to happen and if not why do he not act 
 as i have say many time the government want the prosecution to proceed and allow every opportunity for evidence to be provide for it and for the cps to gather that the prime minister have already   state when he be inform that the trial be in that process he also make it clear yesterday in response to   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat that it be not his position to interfere the case be then drop by the cps independently 
 the cps have independence from ministers civil servant do not the whole point of our constitution be that civil servant can never be throw under the bus because minister be responsible they own everything the civil servant do there be no carve out because someone have this high title of be a national security adviser they be a civil servant it be not once it happen repeatedly in an iterative process by which the cps ask for and say there be a gap what be it will the minister please stop try to make out that we have a different constitution from the we have in which he suggest that somehow minister be not responsible for the behaviour of their civil servant when that be the foundation of accountability within our parliamentary system 
 i will refer back to what i have say already it be not the place of ministers under this or previous government to be vet or interfere in evidence on that matter 
 the battle with china be not just an economic it be also a battle of idea about how the state should operate and the fact that this case have collapse be make a complete mockery of our argument about how the state should operate compare with how china do thing i suggest to the minister that along with the prime minister he be in danger of inadvertently mislead the house he have be ask a number of time about the content of the statement in relation to the conservative party position at the time and he have insist that the statement make only reflect the position of the conservative government at the time will the minister explain then why the exact wording in the labour party manifesto in relation to china and its role end up in that statement 
 the wording in that statement be put in there to provide wide context of the situation but as i have say many time and i will keep say it that wording be provide independently by the dnsa without any involvement from ministers or political adviser 
 rise 
 be you in at the beginning 
 no 
 do not bother waste my time then 
 can the minister tell we whether the attorney general share the concern of the cps that there be not enough evidence to prosecute 
 i think every member of the house share the concern that the case do not proceed and that there be not enough evidence but that decision be take by the cps 
 early this week the security minister   the hon member for barnsley north dan jarvis come to this house and say that the national security adviser do not have any link to the group a group that promote economic link between the uk and china why do the minister say that when the national security adviser be list as a fellow of the group on its website until very recently 
 i can not reply on specific of the group i do not know that but the national security adviser be not involve in any part of this as the prime minister make clear yesterday 
 the cps decision not to prosecute leaf our nation less secure what assurance can the minister give the house that the government do everything in their power to ensure that the cps have the necessary evidence to prosecute 
 as i have say several time this government do everything they could to support the cps in that process and to allow evidence to be submit but i gently point out again that of the reason that this do not proceed be conservative policy at the time not materially different from this policy and the reliance on the act 
 minister what a baptism of fire as an mp i understand the beautiful picture that word can paint but i also understand the damage of ugly word and unfortunately i see here the problem that play with word be lead to with great respect to the minister do he acknowledge that the play on word by the government and the cps further erode trust in government and that the witness statement may be construe to underline the view of my constituent in strangford and elsewhere that china be a threat to those in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland will the minister meet his cabinet colleague to find an open and transparent path to justice not simply for this but to send a message to the chinese government to ensure they accept the sovereignty of this country and this nation and the protection that should and do exist for all those who live here my constituent and everybody ’s constituent 
 the hon gentleman raise a good point and i thank he for his kind word in welcome i if i can speak as many time in this place as he do i will be very grateful—[interruption i be not sure anyone really want that he make a very serious point about the threat pose by china and the threat pose to his constituent and all our constituent by that that be the central message we should be try to get back to how the government can work across the party and how with the cps and other we can all work to ensure that this kind of thing can never happen again 
 on a point of order mr speaker until the statement be publish last night some of we have no idea about the detail of this case but the government appear to be unwilling to answer question that have be ask repeatedly in this chamber so can you mr speaker kindly help i to ascertain how we get answer to they the concern proof that for the month   the cps ask about the dnsa at no point speak to any ministers or the national security adviser why when the prime minister be inform that the case would collapse do he not do everything in his power and be there any evidence that he take any action at all and why if the government be so disappointed that the case collapse have there be to this day no repercussion for the chinese communist party despite the government in power have every tool in the box to make it clear that we will protect this house this democracy and this country 
 i can not prolong the uq i know the hon lady well and i know she will not leave it at that point of order she will go and use all the option that be open to she and i be sure that she will be come back in not too distant a time 
 rise 
 i call tom tugendhat who will not keep this debate go 
 on a point of order mr speaker i will not i be go to raise a different argument if i may give that the government ’s position be that the bureaucrat run the government and be in charge of everything may we dissolve this house and save the taxpayer the money because clearly this be not a democracy any more 
 i be sure the right hon member would not want to give up his seat quite so quickly 
 on a point of order mr speaker you have take a close interest in this issue mr speaker the fact that it go to the heart of this parliament on the protection of members of parliament and the secret that we sometimes hold i be sure that you will share my concern that someone on their very outing have be send out on this issue and that the prime minister use yesterday ’s prime minister ’s question and have not face proper scrutiny in this house in a statement may i gently ask whether you would seek to have he make a statement to the house 
 it be not even a point of order and you know that we be keep the debate go i do congratulate the minister and feel sorry that this be his outing but i have to say if you take the pay check you also take the pain that go with it
