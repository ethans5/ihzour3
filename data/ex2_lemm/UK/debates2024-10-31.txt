it have be a real privilege to share the debate with so maiden speech this afternoon something i do not expect my hon friend   the member for ribble valley maya ellis   be not in her place just now but i be sure her father would have be proud of she as will her husband i have a fantastic charity in my constituency call dads rock which support dad and give they confidence it sound like her husband be a dad who rock 
 it have be remarkable that margaret thatcher have be invoke quite a few time it be quite unusual for her name to be mention so many time in my presence i grow up in fife during the 1980s and i be sure my hon friend   the member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker   would agree that the impact that she have there be still feel today people still feel the impact of the rapid deindustrialisation of proud community i be sure that my hon friend have casework still about the impact of that 
 it be emotional yesterday to hear the chancellor deliver her fantastic speech i be still a little hoarse today from all the emotion this be the budget our   country need and the imf agree which be incredible it be great news for labour mps to wake up to this morning i expect colleague from other party be less happy the chance of my be elect be always slim but i promise those i meet on the campaign trail that labour would get our country back on track yesterday ’s budget be proof that we be serious about that we have spend the week since the election clearing up the mess which be leave by other but the budget set down the foundation for what we want to do next it be transformative budget i can not believe we be achieve so much in our budget but it be only the start of a real change for our country 
 the budget will work for both the work people who call edinburgh south west home but also the young and retire people who deserve well fund public service the measure that we set out yesterday be a re set establish the tone for the remainder of this parliament and for the come decade not just year go be the irresponsible commitment without plan to follow through that we have be deal with since the election it feel like the grown up be now run the country 
 we have a budget that provide the stability to encourage growth and investment in our nation ’s infrastructure and our public service after read through the detail of the budget it be clear that when my colleague anas sarwar say 
 read my lip no austerity under labour 
 he mean it the chancellor have deliver the budget will deliver for the people of scotland with a record break £ for the scottish government ’s budget in that have the potential to be entirely life change not just for my constituent but for people right across scotland the chancellor yesterday prove that when labour win scotland win with the measure announce result in more investment per head of population in scotland than in the rest of the uk 
 the scotland office be now equip with a budget for trade mission around the world sell brand scotland and bring in new investment and custom to countless scottish business some of the lowest pay scot will also feel the benefit in their payslip we will close the age band on the living wage which have always be unacceptable the budget have protect work scot and have lay the foundation for a new era of investment and growth in scotland raise money from those with the broad shoulder 
 with all that in mind i find it rather embarrass that snp members talk with a straight face about this be an austerity budget it be almost as if they write their speech before they hear the budget it be quite curious i can only guess as other have comment none of they be here today that they be busy rewrite their line and think about how they be go to respond but i think a lot of people in scotland will find it unacceptable that no snp members be here today to engage in this debate 
 be it not time when the uk labour government have give the scottish government their large ever funding settlement that the snp begin to take responsibility for its own mismanagement of scotland ’s finance in government the snp have waste million on pet project rather than the service on which so many scot rely we have have ferry with paint   window as i speak a hospital in edinburgh be be close as an emergency action because of a lack of maintenance this be not a small hospital the princess alexandra eye pavilion cater for out patient per week and it have be close almost overnight it be a planned process but that have be force it be absolutely incredible and shameful 
 in parallel with that local authority have be starve of cash and our town and city have find their public service decimate on tuesday i meet sector group in my constituency who be prepare to make staff redundant due the pressure of snp cut to social care at past yesterday just as the chancellor be get ready to speak i receive a whatsapp message from a gp serve of the most deprived part of my constituency she describe the cut to social care service in edinburgh as catastrophic and devastating at quarter past last night i receive an email from a gp make exactly the same point the snp will blame westminster or howl austerity but in reality that be mince that be a scottish phrase madam deputy speaker the scottish government ’s own decision be to blame for much of the pressure face scotland ’s finance that be not just my view but the consider view of the official economic forecaster in scotland 
 the budget present the scottish government with a choice they can use the record funding to own the problem that they create and get our public service back on track include the social care service i talk about the only alternative to that be hand over power to anas sarwar in scotland because more guddle can not be an option but i fear that that be what we be go to get if the snp be not up for that challenge scottish labour be ready to step in my constituent know more than most the impact of the snp ’s cut and mismanagement because edinburgh scotland ’s capital have the worst fund local authority in scotland with this additional funding it be high time that the scottish government do the right thing and stop starve our council of the resource it need councillor cammy day edinburgh ’s council leader make that demand yesterday let we hope that the funding will be a lifeline to social care provider 
 in scottish voter will have the opportunity to elect a scottish labour government that will work hand in hand with this uk labour government to continue to deliver for the people of scotland however until then we scottish labour mps and our colleague at holyrood and in council chamber will hold the scottish government to account for how they choose to spend the additional funding after all i think we can all agree that the scottish government have not just need more cash they have need to get well at spend it 
 we see yesterday what a labour chancellor can do to turn around the life of work people even in the face of a shocking legacy hand to we by the conservatives this government have give the scottish government all the financial tool they need to succeed just imagine how truly transformative it would be if we have a scottish labour finance secretary work in partnership with a labour chancellor here in london that be our goal 
 the investment summit announce a lot of investment for which the conservative government be actually responsible let we wait and see the budget be yesterday business will have to look very carefully at their plan but i do not expect they to do so in a mere few hour i be happy to have this debate with the hon gentleman again in a few week time once we have see the impact of the measure that have be announce 
 there be specific measure that i want to touch on because they have a particular impact on my constituent of they which have be mention a number of time in this debate be the removal of agricultural property relief the country land and business association estimate that that will affect business family   farm in particular will feel the impact bad it be hardly surprising that the president of the national farmers union have say 
 this budget not only threaten family farm but will also make produce food more expensive the shameless breaking of those promise on agricultural property relief will snatch away much of the next generation ’s ability to carry on produce british food plan for the future and shepherd the environment 
 this be a measure that the labour party say it would not introduce but it have break that promise and be now propose to introduce it with enormous damage not just to farmer but to food security and our environment 
 the measure that i would like to touch on—[interruption madam deputy speaker i see you have acquire speaker ’s cough i will heed your warning but i want to mention vat on private school in my constituency i have small independent school heathcote school in danbury elm green in littleborough and malden court school the parent who send their child there be not rich they make huge sacrifice in essex we be very fortunate to have really good grammar school those parent make that sacrifice to help their child hopefully get into the grammar but they will not be able to continue if there be increase in fee as a result of the imposition of vat they will withdraw their child and those school will be threaten with closure the consequence be that the child will need to be place in state school which be already under huge pressure my constituency be grow rapidly and there be enormous pressure on school this will simply make it bad this policy be simply vindictive and will do enormous damage 
 very quickly i note that the minister for secondary care   the hon member for bristol south karin smyth   have come back into the chamber and she would be disappoint if i do not say that i welcome the hospital building programme in the budget and the announcement of new money however once again i reiterate that a hospital in my constituency be threaten with closure we have be promise a new for year or more under both my government and the government before that she be good enough to see my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   and i the other day so that we could make the case if she do hold this money i hope that she might be able to direct some of it to my constituency 
 this budget be of the bad i have hear in all my time in this place it will do enormous damage i be grateful for this opportunity to put that on the record

 my constituency be call livingston which be understandable as that be the big town in the constituency and the county but the constituency be so much more than that it include town and village such as breich dechmont ecclesmachan uphall longridge broxburn bents stoneyburn addiewell kirknewton wilkieston east calder mid calder west calder and fauldhouse each rich with history and a distinct community spirit the area ’s economy and population be initially boost by mining of coal in the west and oil shale in the east the landscape still bear witness to this history with the bing that remain that be why it be important to i that the chancellor announce in yesterday ’s budget that we be deliver on our manifesto commitment to return the investment reserve to miner we be hand back £ to former miner and their family in fact former miner in the livingston constituency will receive an average increase of £ per week in their pension for those who would like a further insight into scottish oil and the shale oil industry there be the almond valley visitor centre which bring to life the truly commercial oil work in the world and celebrate the west lothian chemist james paraffin young ’s work and discovery 
 however the big growth in the area be in the 1960 with the creation of the new town of livingston many from glasgow and the west of scotland venture east because of the promise of improved housing and job opportunity that entrepreneurial spirit be still alive in livingston which be the home of high end manufacturer like wyman gordon biotech company like valneva glenmorangie ’s bottle plant paterson ’s shortbread factory mitsubishi electric a designer outlet village sky and numerous small and medium sized enterprise which be the lifeblood of our local economy now that i have highlight pateron ’s shortbread and glenmorangie i be expect a visit from my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland all in the name of promote brand scotland of course 
 as i prepare to give this speech i seek inspiration from the maiden speech of previous mps for livingston robin cook and tam dalyell who know a thing or about speak in this place even in their maiden speech they set themselves apart with their wit intellect and fire for social justice tam dalyell use his experience as a school teacher to outline practical reform that could be make to the education system and robin cook a former chair of housing on edinburgh city council make a plea for more and well housing i take from they that you should talk about what you   know and if i can maintain that for my whole parliamentary career i think i will be do rather well tam dalyell and robin cook be giant of scottish labour politic who in their different way make a mark in this place we new scottish labour mps must now make ours 
 there be a scottish labour thread of history in this place from hardie maxton lee and dewar to cook brown and darling live up to that be an impossible task but try we must because in that trying and effort be the opportunity to make a change the idea of be a scottish mp in the parliament of the united kingdom be important to i i be scottish and i be british i do not see these identity as contradictory but they be different give that all nation be part of the united kingdom and have be in some case for hundred of year it would seem logical that the uk identity would subsume all but that be not so 
 the idea of scotland be powerful it have stand the test of time and it mean different thing to different people in the borders the highland the island community the east the west the central belt urban area and rural area but there be a common fabric of what it mean to be scottish and it bind we together whether we be bear into be scottish or choose to make our home in scotland this be part of who we be and have scotland as of the nation make our country great than the sum of its part 
 the theme of today ’s debate be fix the foundation because over the last year our country have not be on secure foundation the chaos of the last year across the uk and particularly the last year in scotland where there have be a focus on the constitution not the day job have make our country feel less secure and life feel too precarious for far too many family be mistake a piece of bad luck or a decision that be no fault of their own away from disaster that be no way to live that be why this budget which ensure a pay rise for over of the lowest pay scot let more family keep more of their hard earn cash be important for family right across the livingston constituency 
 i want to come to this place to make sure that everyone no matter their background can thrive that be what drive i and my politic have grow up in a working class family in a working class town in central scotland in the 80 and 90 i have see what happen when people have opportunity and security and what happen when they do not my father work in a plastic plant in grangemouth for over year provide our family with stability and dignity through unionised work without it i would not be here today 
 there be hope for the future yesterday ’s budget mark the end of the era of austerity and raise much need cash for our public service this labour budget deliver the large budget settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution it mean there be an additional £ for the scottish government to spend in this financial year and an additional £ next year this be a significant increase in investment to ensure that we have the funding available for scotland ’s nhs school and public service it be now for the snp which have lose its way in recent year to get a grip and spend the money wisely 
 i recently visit the larder a social enterprise provide solution to poverty through learn opportunity and access to high quality affordable food it support   young people for whom traditional academic setting have often not work help they to build skill and confidence the larder have have huge success in turn life around so it can be do we have the people and drive to build strong community we have a government who be on the side of work people and we should not rest until everyone in this country have the opportunity that they need to build a more secure life for themselves and their family that be what i resolve to spend my time in this place do on behalf of people in the livingston constituency 
 thank you madam deputy speaker my journey here come via almost year in local government as an officer work on economic development and regeneration i grow up among passionate socialist but i also see the investment that small business all around i put into their local area so i be delighted to be make my maiden speech as the labour mp for ribble valley in this debate on a budget that truly harness the good of both social policy and great british enterprise we need both and we need they to work together 
 for a young woman full of dream and want to change the world sometimes our day to day can feel a pretty restrictive place to be anyone who have feel hold back in their ambition will know that it can take just or people to believe in you to make all the difference to whether you carry on or give up i can not possibly name all the people who help i get here   but you know who you be and it make all the difference that you never question for a that i could do this 
 it be so easy to quickly take for grant that we be speak in a debate on a budget present by the ever woman chancellor of the exchequer she will know as well as i do that as fairytale as our journey may seem at their high point right now the prejudice and obstacle that we face and that woman face every day be still far too high i have say it to many woman and i will say it to any listening now you be as smart and as capable as you think you be do not let anyone convince you otherwise we need your fire 
 i have be in westminster a few month now and thing i hear people say frequently about my predecessor the right hon nigel evans be how much he love and care for this place that we stand in today mr evans work incredibly hard and diligently as deputy speaker and on the restoration and renewal programme board we be very lucky to have this well manage centre of debate and challenge in the uk and i be grateful to mr evans and to all those who work here for uphold our exceptional standard of democracy 
 i promise mr evans on the night of the election that i would take care of the ribble valley constituency that i know we both love i can already safely say that i will likewise show this incredible institution of westminster and our strong democracy the respect and protection that i know we both value so highly 
 i be of those exceptionally lucky mp who have live in their constituency most of our life it mean that i know it like the back of my hand for well or bad it also mean that i encounter situation like i do the other day when of my old brownie leader call i over while do the school run to raise an issue about local social housing i be on it jan i promise 
 my constituency of ribble valley be a patchwork of our country ’s history and its future we remember the battle of bamber bridge when local stand up against white gi to welcome black us soldier into their pub a brilliant example of the inclusion and multi- culturalism that make this country great in samlesbury we have produce plane to protect the country since world war and i be delighted that progress on establish the national cyber force in my constituency be well under way it will lead our country ’s research develop our future security and build our skill in cyber 
 people be often surprise by the size of the ribble valley constituency its boundary have change over the year but it currently reach from the lancashire yorkshire border with picture perfect village such as tosside rimington waddington west bradford and chipping through to the lively suburb of preston take in fulwood bamber bridge and walton le- dale and almost reach the ribble estuary at the irish sea 
 i see the breadth of my constituency as its depth we have wonderful place to live though much could be do to keep they safe and kinder we have great transport link with the m6 run through and it be only hour to london on the train from preston we also have utterly stunning countryside include a large part of the trough of bowland where the late queen say that she would have love to retire 
 strong community be so important to i and both the rural and urban area of my constituency be make up of village that come together to create celebration such as the lostock hall carnival and the broughton scarecrow festival just last week 
 right in the heart of my constituency be my home village of ribchester where my family have live since and where i be now raise my family i must pay a quick tribute to the people of that village from the amateur dramatic society and the church to the brownie unit and the parish council the village show i the good of what it mean to be british i look forward to this government ease the burden on family so that they can spend more time contribute to the amazing community that we all need to thrive 
 the only person i know who love ribble valley more than i do be my dad he travel the world live in big city and in commune dream of new way to live our life but i recently find a letter that he write to himself at age in which he speak of the strange pull back to our beautiful little corner of the world where he choose to raise his family and without know it raise the labour mp he dream of it have 
 it be my deep sadness that my dad do not live to see i stand here but i know that he relish every heated debate we have at the dinner table and along with my mum of the most intelligent woman i know i think my dad have an eye to what he be prepare i for he be the big feminist i have ever know and in i i think he raise the big 
 a lot of my career have involve work on innovation policy which have collide over time with my passion for social justice i think we all need a vision to look towards and i want we to be ambitious that our rapid advance in technology and automation should translate into great reward for worker i would like to think that it be not too utopian to hope that we will move to a standard day working week in my lifetime 
 so much of what our society need do not necessarily cost money but it do cost time time to give our child focus play time to truly rest our body so that they do not crumble far too early and time to live slowly and to grow our own food to reduce the huge demand on this earth technology can give we time if that be where we choose to channel the benefit 
 before i finish i will touch on my utmost priority as a member of parliament work family we need to make life much more tenable more affordable and dare i say more joyful for parent who want to contribute to our country while also raise good human it be also critical to i that we make sure the child have the life support and love they deserve 
 we have a vision for an innovative and high growth economy but we do not get innovation without diversity of thought this parliament be the most diverse in history and i as of those new diverse member be able to be here with my mental health just about intact only because my husband take month of paternity leave with both our child this mean that when an election be call day after i be select as the labour candidate i do not have to spend a single handing childcare over to he he already know   how to change a nappy what to pack in a bag and the book my child want to read at bedtime i fully believe i would not be stand here now if he have not take paternity leave that opportunity should not be rare 
 forgive i for speak in a hetero normative context but that be my personal experience we know that few dad take up paternity or parental leave which mean that many woman can not dream of put themselves forward for political office as i do know that my husband can confidently care for my child give i time to think to organise and to dream too many woman be still unable to do this because their mental load fill every bit of additional brain space they have 
 we need the idea and dream of mother and parent to propel our business our public service and our society i be delighted to join the campaign organisation pregnant then screwed and the dad shift early this month to try to shift the dial on parent equality i hope to see some truly ambitious step change as our government review paternity leave over this coming year not only to create a new vision of fatherhood in this country but to unlock the dream and plan of mother which we have be so desperately lacking but which be so desperately important i send a huge thank you to my incredible husband for hold the fort at home and for be the foundation of my standing here today 
 finally i want to acknowledge that it take a lot of bravery to be a girl or a young woman today it always have it be relentless scary and exhausting especially for those with caring responsibility or face additional prejudice there be a reason to give up and a time i almost do but please do not give up i can promise you this brave girl grow up and day you might stand here and be the in charge 
 give that almost bank branch close over the past year on the conservative party ’s watch it have increasingly be leave to the post office to provide vital banking service on the high street i be sure the banking industry recognise its responsibility to work with we to ensure that sub postmaster whose pay have not increase for a decade and the post office have what they need to help meet the critical cash and banking need of all our constituent 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support high street business

 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question and i think this be the time i have have the chance to congratulate she on her election to this house she be absolutely right that if we be to see our   high street thrive we need to ensure there be a genuinely level playing field for business online and those on the high street as the chancellor announce yesterday to deliver that pledge we intend to introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property from to fund that we intend to introduce a large business multipli from which will apply a high rate on the most valuable property that will capture the majority of large distribution warehouse include those use by the online giant however we want to go far so the chancellor publish a discussion paper yesterday ask business for further idea on the reform of business rate 
 small and independent shop be the lifeblood of our high street and they make the community in my ashford constituency special far too many high street business have be feel the squeeze over recent year which have lead to empty unit be an all too familiar sight i welcome the measure announce in yesterday ’s budget particularly the reform of business rate will my hon friend update the house on what the government be do to empower local community to acquire empty unit 
 again i congratulate my hon friend on his election to this house colleague across whitehall be bring forward plan to introduce high street rental auction which will bring vacant unit back into use that should make town centre more accessible and affordable for tenant we will also take step to crack down on antisocial behaviour we see a huge increase in antisocial behaviour and crime in our high street under the conservative party and we be determined to take step to crack down on that 
 i thank my hon friend for his previous answer we be bless with some fantastic high street in hendon such as mill hill broadway station road and the high street in edgware watling avenue in burnt oak brent street in hendon and vivian avenue in west hendon however when i talk to business owner they all too often tell i that they be struggle to find and retain the staff they need to grow successfully what step be the department take to make sure small business can get the skilled staff they need not just to survive but to thrive 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s question and i know the high street in his constituency that he mention as they be very close to britain ’s great constituency he will be aware that we have already take step to help business recruit more skilled staff it be of the reason why we have establish skills england we have also take step to reform the apprenticeship levy and early this week the prime minister bring forward plan to help people get back to work 
 the anti growth coalition on mid sussex district council lead by the lib dems labour independent and greens be bring in sunday bank holiday and evening town centre parking charge on top of a rise and there be the sword of damocles of possible village car parking charge will the minister reiterate to council that be determined to derail his growth mission that such draconian   measure on our high street will do exactly the opposite of what he and his budget be apparently look to achieve and will he perhaps meet they 
 i gently suggest to the hon lady that those make up the anti growth coalition be sit on her side of the house and i gently point out to she that the high number of business to go bust for year be under the conservative party last year i would also happily ask she to use her influence with the conservative lead council in my constituency which be bring in parking charge that will certainly damage the night time economy 
 i welcome some thing that the minister have refer to regard high street business and i thank he for that but there be many other matter for example in newtownards family business make up a great many of the attractive high street business such as wardens knotts bakery and the family butcher and they be important as they be in ballynahinch have the minister have the opportunity to talk to the chamber of trade in newtownards which be work well other chamber of trade in my constituency can also contribute so have there be an opportunity to speak to they to get their idea about the way forward 
 the hon gentleman be an assiduous champion for his constituency in this house if he want to bring his chamber of commerce to meet i to discuss issue in his constituency in more detail i will happily make time to meet he and they 
 we be minute go and still on question we need to speed up a little bit if the minister could look at i that would be helpful so that we be go through the person i know that mr shannon be popular but even so it should go through i i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in my constituency the number of people shop on our high street have not return to pre covid level and we have lose anchor store such as marks spencer and several bank the government urgently need to save our high street but the reduction in retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief from to will come as bad news for thousand of business when will the government deliver a fundamental reform of business rate to save our high street and end the penalising of productive investment 
 i be grateful for your guidance mr speaker while   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   be popular you be much more important 
 i gently point out to   the hon member for wokingham clive jones   that we have start the process of reform business rate we be introduce permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure from we have listen to business and keep business rate relief and we be open up opportunity for business to come forward with idea for future reform of business rate 
 if he will take step to increase the use of sectoral collective bargaining 
 the government be commit to strengthen the collective voice of worker and restore the principle that work should always pay that be why we introduce the employment rights bill which will restore the school support staff negotiate body and introduce a framework for a fair pay agreement in adult social care combine with other measure in the bill that will empower worker union and employer to come together to negotiate fair pay term and condition 
 i thank the minister for that answer it be fantastic of the labour government to bring in the employment rights bill within their day an absolutely brilliant achievement expert say that sectoral bargaining be a force to be reckon with for both employee and employer so what plan might the government have to extend sectoral collective bargaining in other sector of the economy 
 my hon friend be right to say that there be plenty of evidence worldwide that collective bargaining improve term and condition and the overall vitality of the economy but we must start somewhere about of the entire work population be employ in adult social care and with a turnover rate and rampant abuse of hour contract and the minimum wage law we feel that that sector need the most attention we must make a concerted effort to drive up working condition because those who work in that area have be undervalue and underappreciate for far too long and that have to change we must focus on get it right in adult social care and we will see where that take we 
 undoubtedly government legislation be empower the union we see that this week when the secretary of state for scotland be unable to meet cbi scotland an important body because he could not enter his own building because of a picket line we read in the paper this morning that aslef a rail union insist on use fax machine and will not allow its member to use email how be that help collective bargaining 
 i have to educate the hon member on what trade union do aslef be not a union in the adult social care sector which be what we be talk about here we want to work on a tripartite basis business and worker together with the government to get term and condition right give that we have the low increase in living standard on record under the conservative government i would have think that he would want to support that too 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government ’s impact assessment for the adult social care sector confirm that collective bargaining will be very costly for business   if pay award match those of junior doctor the cost of the increase wage bill will be £ drive up business rate reduce employment or hour and impose further cost on business can the minister confirm when further collective bargaining will be roll out to which sector and by how much those business can expect to be clobber 
 if the shadow minister be complain about the state of the adult social care sector he should look to his own party and how the sector be leave to rot for year the impact assessment say that the overall cost to employer will be overall and as the economic analysis say the make work pay package will help to raise living standard across the country and create opportunity for all i think be a fantastic achievement to get such a deal if he do not want to support improve working condition for people an end to fire and rehire and well maternity protection he should continue to vote against the employment rights bill but i do not think his constituent will thank he for that 
 what recent progress he have make on develop a new industrial strategy 
 we have make significant progress in develop a new industrial strategy and i be delighted to report to the house that we publish a green paper on   october set out our plan for a modern industrial strategy we have set our sight high than the previous government we have throw off their ideological shackle and we have work in partnership with business and our colleague across the nation and region to set we on a path to a credible year plan deliver the certainty drive and ambition that business need to invest in the uk 
 for year business in rural community such as my constituency be ignore and neglect by the conservatives in government will the minister elaborate on how the industrial strategy will allow rural community to share in the proceed of growth 
 the difference between a labour government and a conservative government be that we believe that growth need to be feel in our community not just measure on a spreadsheet i know that my hon friend be work hard in his constituency and be already campaign on issue such as banking service which be so important for our rural community he be right the industrial strategy need to be design and implement in lockstep with local leader mayor and devolve leader across the country alongside our wide plan for housing and skill which of course will be part of the picture i look forward to work with he on identify the barrier to growth in rural community so that we can break they down 
 the development of marine renewable energy be get close to commercial deployment if we be able to get it across the line it will bring with it a supply chain that we can build and hold in this country with a view to export across the world that would surely be a great   result for any industrial strategy what will the government do to ensure that their industrial strategy help marine renewable reach full commercial deployment 
 the right hon gentleman make a really good point and i would be happy to have a proper conversation with he about it marine renewable be a huge opportunity for we we can build the supply chain across the country and of course scotland be uniquely place to take advantage of that i would love to have a conversation about it 
 when it come to an industrial strategy in the labour government ’s few month they have effectively shut down uk virgin steelmaking capacity with no commitment to primary steel in yesterday ’s budget of broken promise unlike the united states and the european union the government have fail to protect our car manufacturer against chinese state aid they have massively increase the cost to the very driver of industry real business of employ people should the government not call it their deindustrialisation strategy 
 the challenge we have be that we have inherit the bad living standard growth during a parliament in modern history we have inherit huge challenge that we have to overcome but we be look to the long term with our industrial strategy—[interruption 
 order i do not need any more do we understand each other 
 i do not know whether   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith   have be pay attention but we be develop a steel strategy which the previous government fail to do with £ of funding we put a boost of £ into our car industry only yesterday in the budget alongside £ for the automotive sector and money for life science we be develop an industrial strategy for the long term for the time and we will not follow the conservative party which let our industry suffer and get to the crisis point that we be now have to deal with 
 the minister mention the car industry yesterday after the budget of broken promise talk about the industrial strategy mike hawes of the society of motor manufacturers and trader say 
 deliver that strategy depend on the uk be globally competitive additional national insurance contributions will put massive pressure on the automotive supply chain which be predominantly sme 
 he describe the lack of substantive measure to support the new car market as hugely disappointing conclude that 
 the cost will soon be feel in reduce uk investment economic growth and job 
 with such dire warning so early on be this not more evidence that labour just do not get business and that its industrial strategy be in tatter before it have even begin 
 for a government who do not get business it be surprising be it not that we get £ of investment through the international investment   summit twice what the previous government manage after year of plan it the government be work very closely with the automotive industry we know that the global situation be very difficult and i talk to mike hawes very often which be why we put £ of funding into the budget yesterday it be also why we be work very closely with the sector to create the condition we need to transition to electric vehicle and to protect our industry in a way that the previous government frankly fail to do 
 what recent step he have take to help prevent e bike battery fire 
 the office for product safety and standards within my department have be work across government and industry to protect consumer and understand the cause of any safety issue that have include give consumer clear information that enable they to purchase use and charge product safely assess the compliance of manufacturer and importer to ensure that product be safe when place on the market and a programme of work to address the sale of non compliant product available through online marketplace include e bike and their battery last week i visit the opss ’s teddington laboratory where we launch the department ’s new buy safe be safe consumer campaign 
 week ago there be a fire in a floor flat in plaistow in my constituency thankfully the quick reaction of the resident and neighbour and the good work of the london fire brigade mean that they be all able to be evacuate quickly and there be no serious injury clearly this could have be bad do the minister agree that it be a perfect example of why we need to continue to work to make these battery safe and run awareness campaign so that resident understand the safety issue and how they can be mitigate and how the battery can be dispose of if they need to get rid of they 
 my hon friend be absolutely right manufacturer must already ensure that product be safe and provide instruction for safe use include safe charging i pay tribute to the london fire brigade for the work it be do on this issue unfortunately as we have hear there be far too many fire that be why we launch our awareness campaign last week we be hop through the product regulation and metrology bill to make sure we have power to keep up with technological development and ensure that e bike can be sell safely to consumer in the uk 
 what progress his department have make on deliver the make work pay programme 
 as the chancellor announce yesterday the national living wage will rise to £ an   hour mean that a full time worker can earn an extra £ a year we have also announce the stopping of the use of minimum service level and tackle late payment for the self employ of course we have now introduce the employment rights bill which will raise living standard across the country and provide well support for business engage in good practice it also make good on our promise to the british people that we will now make work pay 
 i thank the minister for his answer in my constituency of watford many people be employ in the hospitality retail and construction sector and with a big hospital in the health and social sector will the minister confirm that the government ’s make work pay plan will bring long last benefit to they and to other worker 
 absolutely we be determined to ensure that the particular sector that my hon friend mention where low pay and insecurity be rife will benefit we be work closely with business and employer across the spectrum to ensure that we get the proposal right because for too long insecurity and low pay have be rife in the uk economy that have to change 
 i call the shadow minister 
 after receive million from the trade union paymaster for its election labour be reward they with a package of 1970 french style workplace regulation which will increase the cost of do business in the uk to the tune of £ a year disproportionately fall on sme that be before the £ body blow to business deliver by the chancellor yesterday in her anti business budget of broken promise do the minister agree with the office for budget responsibility that this government ’s decision will make worker poor not rich as increase employment taxis be pass on in low wage and that business investment will fall not rise as a direct result of this government 
 i find it incredible that the opposition quote french style labour law because when they introduce the minimum service legislation they always hold up france as the example of where that work already i wish they would make their mind up the implication behind the question about trade union funding say rather more about their attitude to how legislation be make in this country than ours we do thing because we believe in they if he look carefully at what the obr be say £ into people ’s pocket as a result of the national living wage increase be a fantastic achievement that we should all be proud of 
 what step he be take to help support small business to scale up 
 what step he be take to help support small business to scale up 
 our plan for small business will help they to scale up and increase productivity and growth we be do that by create opportunity for business to compete and access the finance they need to scale export and break into new market furthermore at yesterday ’s budget we announce a small business command paper next year which will set out more detail on how we will support small business 
 i welcome the minister ’s answer way that we can support small business to scale up be through infrastructure investment so that business can get their good to market more quickly will the department support my campaign to shift more freight from truck to train start with the channel tunnel in my constituency where only of its freight capacity be be use at present 
 let i take the opportunity to congratulate my hon friend on his election to this house i remember well as i be sure he do the problem that the people and business of kent have to endure when the m20 become a lorry park thank to a combination of poor planning by the last government and the poor quality trade deal they negotiate with brussels we certainly support the expansion of rail freight not least as it help to build the resilience of supply chain i would be happy to meet he or facilitate a meeting for he with transport ministers to hear more about his campaign 
 small business such as the greek corner in shipley have benefit from bradford council ’s business growth programme fund by the town fund which provide capital assistance for business to create new job the support measure announce yesterday in the chancellor ’s budget for local authority and small business will be vital to revitalise our high street do the minister agree that local authority work with local community be well place to direct investment to help sme grow 
 let i take this opportunity to congratulate my hon friend on her election too i agree that local authority work with local community be fundamental to support sme in local economy that be reason why as well as back local authority in yesterday ’s budget we be back tracy brabin the excellent mayor of west yorkshire with funding to support the priority of local community in constituency such as that of my hon friend it be also why we be introduce measure such as high street rental auction and a powerful community right to buy so that local community can start the process of revive their high street 
 i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the minister mention that access to finance be vital for small business but i hope he know that the past few day have see chaos in the motor finance market with a number of major lender suspend lend entirely in response to a judgment in the appeal court this have cause consternation across the entire business lending sector can the minister reassure we that the government be fully engage with   the industry and the financial conduct authority in sort out an issue that could have a very very significant impact on the entire sector and its supply chain 
 we be certainly look at the issue that have arise for the industry from the judgment more generally on access to finance i be sure the right hon gentleman will welcome our launch at the investment summit reference by the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders of the british growth partnership which be aim at unlock investment in business that want to scale up 
 economic growth happen when micro sized business become small business we learn yesterday that micro business that employ up to full time worker on the national living wage will be exempt from employer national insurance yet small business that employ worker or more will be subject to employer national insurance how will that measure help small business in the south west to scale up and bring economic growth to the region 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman welcome i think the measure we take in the budget to raise employment allowance to help the very small firm the federation of small businesses say yesterday that it will be a very big help for small firm on his wide point about the budget i gently say to he as i be sure he know only too well that the economic inheritance the government face have lead to our have to make some very tough decision if he do not support the measure we have set out in the budget he need to say how he would finance the extra investment in the nhs and in industry that we have set out 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 wokingham have of the high rate of business survival when compare with the average for the south east and berkshire but yesterday ’s announcement that the government will raise employer national insurance throw that into doubt the hike be plain and simple a tax on job that will deal a hammer blow to our small business what will the government do to mitigate the impact on small business in my constituency and across the country 
 i say very gently to the hon gentleman that if he and his party be determined to oppose the measure we take in the budget include on employer national insurance contribution they need to set out how they would fund the extra investment in the nhs the investment in the automotive and aerospace sector and the measure to protect and raise living standard 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his department 's policy of the outcome of the international investment summit 
 we hold as we have say an international investment summit on   october day after we form the new government we secure £ of investment which be twice the level of the previous government ’s investment summit the investment will create high quality high skille well pay job across the country and represent a huge vote of confidence in this new government 
 as my hon friend quite rightly say the labour party be now the party of business without any question do she agree that the measure commit to in yesterday ’s budget on clean energy carbon capture and storage and hydrogen which be back up by the way with a commitment from a canadian investor of another £ in offshore wind show how much this government be in tune with the business community we be attract investment and building on the investment summit and we will deliver job for our constituent and our community up and down the country 
 i agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend i also agree with the former chancellor kwasi kwarteng in his article yesterday i quote 
 conservative like myself should be honest 
 and 
 reeves be clean up our mess 
 what step he be take to support the night time economy 
 we recognise the important role that night time economy business play in support local economy and community healthy night time economy business not only support our creative industry include musician dj and performance artist but bolster tourism and day economy business we be focus on our point plan to breathe life back into britain ’s high street that work will ensure that our high street be great place for our business support economic growth across the uk include in the night time economy 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the hospitality industry be a crucial aspect of the night time economy it already face an existential crisis with post brexit labour shortage covid debt and wage and commodity inflation what advice would the minister give to the hospitality industry and business that now face a hike in national insurance cost and despite the headline a more than double in last year ’s business rate 
 i would gently point business in the night time economy to a series of measure that we take in yesterday ’s budget include to reform business rate for the long term from we listen to business include those in the night time economy and do not abolish the business rate relief under the measure that we have take for example the average pub with a rateable value of almost £ will save over £ next year 
 last saturday night i have the opportunity to go out in york with the police it be incredibly interesting and i be so grateful for the work that they do and it give i an opportunity to speak to employer we know that as employer our traditional pub be really struggle because the pub code be not work properly will the minister meet i and the campaign for pubs to discuss how we can improve thing for those business 
 i will be very happy to meet my hon friend i know from talk to pub that they be also very worried about the rise in antisocial behaviour and crime in our high street and town centre she and the pub and other member of the night time economy that she work with will i hope be reassure by some of the measure that we have take in the budget to begin the process of crack down on antisocial behaviour 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to support fair trade for producer 
 i can assure my hon friend that the united kingdom be commit to advance both free and fair trade around the world that be inclusive sustainable and seek to reduce poverty the uk ’s aid for trade programme include the new trade centre of expertise announce by the prime minister on   october build the capacity of producer business and government in develop country to participate in and prosper from global trade i can assure my hon friend that the uk be commit to make the world a safe and more prosperous place through strengthen our international development work as set out in our recent manifesto 
 child from timothy hackworth primary school in shildon write to ask i to raise fair trade with the minister as part of their fair trade week they include ashton who remind i of the privilege that we have to serve in this place they would also like to know whether the minister have meet representative of the fair trade foundation since his appointment and whether he consider that britain ’s leadership on fair trade policy can make a meaningful contribution to reduce poverty in sub saharan africa 
 let i commend my hon friend for his work with the local primary school i know how assiduous he be in advance the interest of his constituent i can assure he that we fully understand the importance of fair trade i have meet a representative of the fair trade foundation in recent week and i pay particular tribute to the work that fairtrade be do with the co op thousand of farmer produce good such as tea coffee sugar and flower be help by co op in our high street across the country it be now the uk ’s large seller of fair trade product and it deserve our commendation too 
 what step he be take to attract inward investment into scotland 
 the international investment summit about which we just hear secure more than £ include for significant project in scotland scottish power own by iberdrola commit £ to upgrade the uk ’s energy infrastructure over the next year float offshore wind developer green volt have select aberdeen for its headquarters and plan to invest £ that of course come on top of this government ’s establishment of gb energy 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer yesterday see the large budget settlement for the scottish government in devolution ’s history the labour party ’s commitment to scotland run through this government last week the highly respect strathclyde university ’s fraser of allander institute report that only of scottish business agree that the scottish government understand the business environment in scotland do my right hon friend agree that government understanding of business be crucial in drive investment and growth in scotland and that it be critical that the scottish government improve their understanding of the business environment 
 frankly business in scotland have be let down by fail government we have have a decade of division and decay in scotland and i be glad to see that we now have political stability with labour have a majority in scotland wales and england at the same time we be committed to genuine partnership and work with the scottish government i know that my hon friend have particular expertise in energy policy give his past professional work tomorrow i will be in torness in my constituency to meet edf energy just example of a business that frankly be be hold back by the policy and approach of the present scottish government 
 i be not surprised in the slight to hear the disparage comment from those on the government benches about business in scotland so i will bring the house up to speed for the consecutive year scotland under the snp scottish government be the uk ’s top perform area outside london for foreign direct investment yet brexit have reduce the attractiveness of the uk as a base for export to eu market result in its be overtake by france as the lead destination for foreign direct investment in europe do the minister recognise that reverse what he seem to be married to at the moment the tories hard brexit be the most significant step that this government could take to increase inward investment and boost growth in scotland 
 as i be say let i deal with both the fail government who have be let scotland down in the last decade frankly if the hon gentleman want to advance the case that there have be a decade of prosperity in scotland good luck to he the reality be that it be very hard to think of a single aspect of scottish public life that have improve over the last year take the case of ferry take the case of hospital take the case of our school or indeed the broad business environment 
 on brexit i recognise that there be a need for a fundamental reset with the european union and in recent day i have be take forward that work i welcome   the work that the prime minister have be undertake but that be the task of a labour government as so often on so many issue the snp talk and labour deliver 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 in little more than day in government this department and its secretary of state who be fly to doha today have set about deliver on the promise make in our manifesto we have turn up the dial on growth and publish our green paper on the modern industrial strategy which will channel support to key sector work across our nation and region with the private sector and deliver the condition for investment and good job we have deliver a huge vote of confidence in the uk by secure £ of investment at our international investment summit boost by investment plough into our aerospace automotive and life science sector as announce in yesterday ’s budget we have also keep our promise by publish the employment rights bill which represent the big upgrade in worker right in a generation we be a pro innovation pro worker and pro wealth creation government and be invest all our time in grow the economy for the long term and turn round year of failure 
 a day week with no loss of pay have prove to have benefit for employer and employee alike and a recent report by the autonomy institute and alda suggest that it can have a hugely positive impact on the economy the report conclude that iceland ’s economy have outperform most of europe since adopt a short working week and now have of the low unemployment rate with even more uk business begin a day week trial on monday as part of the day week campaign ’s autumn pilot what assessment have the department make of the icelandic report and of the potential impact that a day week could have on uk business and our economy 
 the government have no plan to undertake any trial on a day week for day of pay it be for employer and employee to reach agreement that fit their specific circumstance but we want to get the balance right and make sure that we work with employer and employee that be why the employment rights bill will support both party to reach agreement where they be feasible 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 if labour members go back to their seat this weekend be think of go to a local pub for a pint and a chat with local farmer i would think again a publican with a mid sized pub contact i last night to say that because of yesterday ’s change he would be £ a year bad off move he from profit to loss labour say that its plan be fully cost and fully fund yesterday be a massive break promise be it not 
 the hon gentleman oversee the bad parliament for living standard in modern history we do not choose that inheritance and we have make choice would he rather we do not compensate for the infected blood scandal would he rather we do not compensate the horizon victim for whom there be no money in the budget on his watch would he rather we do not invest in the health service would he rather we do not increase the minimum wage would he rather we do not support carer would he rather we make the choice that he make such as cut national insurance for worker when there be no budget for that this government be fix the foundation so that we can have a bright future for all our country 
 the government ’s choice be to hit business and that be because there be not an ounce of business experience among they labour ’s death taxis will hit farm and business family with a typical farm will have to find hundred of thousand of pound or see their farm break up and sell the environment secretary say month ago that he have no intention of put death taxis on business that be a broken promise be it not 
 i will not take any lecture from the opposition who say eff business conservative members have some cheek to come at we when we be clear up the £ black hole that we inherit and set in train stability i spend quite a lot of yesterday as the hon gentleman would expect talk to and have meeting with business about the budget and its implication we talk about the potential for growth long term stability and change that this labour government be make 
 a study publish by the disability policy centre this week suggest that improve support to get disabled people those with long term health condition and unpaid carer into work and keep they in employment could save the treasury £ pay a high rate of sick pay have be show to increase employee retention and be key to reduce economic inactivity what assessment have the minister make of the impact of the current rate of statutory sick pay on employee retention 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to get more people back into work and need to support they to return in the employment rights bill we be look to increase the scope of sick pay to include people below the low earning limit and to introduce payment from day we have no plan to increase the rate of statutory sick pay but when we get the reform through we will no doubt look at how we can reform it for the well my department for work and pensions colleague will consider that in due course 
 after yesterday ’s budget those run small and medium sized business will see their national insurance rise and their wage bill increase those in hospitality run a pub or restaurant for example will have a reduction in their business rate relief   to top it off the employment rights bill will bring more red tape for business those massive change be happen very quickly do the minister agree with the institute of directors that it be a perfect storm of high taxis high wage and more red tape 
 no i gently point out to the hon gentleman the difficult economic inheritance that his party leave this government to sort out we be determined to walk towards all the tough decision his party refuse to face up to in government if he be against the increase in employer national insurance contribution he need to say how he will fund the investment we announce yesterday in the aerospace and automotive sector and how he would fund the extra investment that we will make in the nhs and other public service 
 we will take no lecture from the conservative party about business plenty of we have experience of business and i be of they 
 many high street business want to continue accept cash just as importantly so do many of my resident particularly the elderly disabled and vulnerable i have speak to the citizen advice bureau which be hear how concerned elderly resident be what step be the government take to ensure that the post office can well offer banking service on the high street to cater for the spender and recipient of cash 
 order these be topical question and they be mean to be short and punchy not speech i be sure we can find time for an adjournment debate for the hon gentleman 
 give that almost bank branch close over the past year on the conservative party ’s watch it have increasingly be leave to the post office to provide vital banking service on the high street i be sure the banking industry recognise its responsibility to work with we to ensure that sub postmaster whose pay have not increase for a decade and the post office have what its need to help meet the critical cash and banking need of all our constituent 
 although yesterday ’s announcement may dampen business expansion plan many business in my constituency and elsewhere find it difficult to expand because of national grid connection what be minister do to engage with the department for energy security and net and national grid to ensure that connection be available 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman ask what we be do to engage with the department for energy security and net because i sit across that department and the department for business and trade the entire point of my role be to make sure that we join up the departments so that we can crack some of these problem the grid be no on our list 
 i warmly welcome the £ investment in a data centre in cambois in my constituency but i share the concern of many resident who believe that it be fast become a plug in centre for huge infrastructure programme do my hon friend agree that when we have huge infrastructure programme in certain constituency resident should benefit from local job and community facility
