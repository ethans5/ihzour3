 thank you madam deputy speaker it be an honour to be call to make my maiden speech as member of parliament for maidenhead a place i have always be proud to call home i recognise the fantastic maiden speech make by   the hon member for peterborough andrew pakes his passion for his constituency be clear from his speech and i know he will be a fantastic representative of his constituent next time i be put mustard on of my ham sandwich i will be think of he and his constituency although maybe not of the pun he make 
 as a new mp i be send a very early email by the fantastic team at the house of commons library with maiden speech from my predecessor to get an idea about what i might like to say but consider that since its inception in my constituency maidenhead have only have prior mp there be not a lot to go on i must start therefore by pay tribute to that predecessor theresa may who represent the maidenhead constituency for year during her time on the front benches and in no she make sure that she put maidenhead once famously have spend a week of late night in negotiation in the eu she get off the plane in london and head straight for a school carol concert in the town centre although i disagree with she on many thing her dedication to the people of maidenhead be something that i admire and hope to emulate hers be big often very much report on by the medium shoe to fill 
 unlike my namesake sir joshua reynolds i can not paint to save my life but fortunately for i and my constituent the village of cookham in my constituency have give we stanley spencer whose work be memorialise   in the stanley spencer gallery on the high street we be lucky to still have a thriving art scene around maidenhead and all our village 
 maidenhead be a special place it have a rich history it be where charles i meet his child for the last time in the greyhound inn now home to the natwest bank before his execution in fortunately visitor to maidenhead today would discover a fantastic array of place to eat the village of bray have no less than michelin star to its name but to find fantastic food in maidenhead you need not go to a restaurant approve by the michelin man you can go to bakedd tomo sauce and flour the borough or seasonality just some of the fantastic place to eat that maidenhead have to offer any time you fancy a trip down the elizabeth line madam deputy speaker i will be more than happy to take you to any of they 
 part of maidenhead ’s history have always be the bridge over the thames soon after the bridge be put up in the town start to build the current incarnation of maidenhead bridge have be stand since the mid-1700 the toll on maidenhead bridge be remove on the night of   october in a move that have it be do today probably would not have be worthy of attention from the office for budget responsibility however it be so significant to resident of maidenhead that they gather by the bridge and as the clock strike midnight take apart the toll gate and throw they into the river 
 another part of our history famous for bridge be the brunel design maidenhead railway bridge otherwise know as the sound arch which open in attract significant attention for its innovative low rise arch design sceptical boss at the great western railway insist that he leave the scaffolding in place because they do not believe it to be safe rumour have it though that brunel comply with their request know that it be not necessary he decide not to attach the scaffolding to the bridge sure enough the wooden structure be soon blow away by a storm and brunel ’s bridge have stand the test of time ever since 
 maidenhead be also home to the late sir nicholas winton who be remember in the nicholas winton memorial garden in oaken grove park and in a statue on platform of maidenhead station sir nicholas dub by the press the british schindler help to save the life of child who be evacuate from czechoslovakia to britain as part of the kindertransport in sir nicholas leave we in have reach the grand age of but his life and legacy as of the great humanitarian be remember in the town 
 it be fair to say that the palace of westminster be slightly large than maidenhead town hall where i be recently a cabinet member for community and leisure however what the town hall lack in grandeur statue and stain glass window it make up for in its television claim to fame i be of course talk about the fact that it be use as the location for carry on doctor when i be work in the town hall i often see an excited fan run up to the building to take photo only to look slightly disappointed know that they have travel so far to see a 1960 office block last but not least on today ’s maidenhead history tour i can not fail to mention that the spice girls once famously share a   house in maidenhead before they burst on to the music scene in i say that even if it be year before i be bear 
 maidenhead be so much more than just the town i have already mention cookham which have be part of the constituency since it be establish in and i have mention bray which move into maidenhead from the windsor constituency bring those michelin star along with it it be however also home to binfield warfield and winkfield which move into the constituency at this election they may be the new part of the constituency but they be just as important as the rest of it and i look forward to spend time in each of they over the next few week as we head into recess 
 i must pay tribute to maidenhead ’s fantastic primary and secondary school they work to give pupil from all walk of life and all ability the good start that they can have i be hugely grateful to my teacher at alwyn courthouse and furze platts senior school for the work and the help they give i without it i would not be speak in the house today 
 it would be remiss of i however not to talk about the challenge that we face locally a significant number of resident in my community live in poverty and homelessness be on the rise along with reliance on food bank our local baby bank found by local resident rebecca and councillor amy tisi be see increase demand for its service we must take action on fuel poverty extend free school meal and restore the basic standard of live that vulnerable resident need the most 
 health service be patchy in maidenhead with gp surgery under phenomenal pressure and the near general hospital be in slough i be determined to see the walk in centre reopen at st mark ’s hospital after it be close down as a temporary measure at the beginning of covid lockdown i want to see the site expand to cope with all the new home and development that be be build and propose for the area my promise to resident be that i will not let up in my effort to close the health gap in maidenhead 
 maidenhead be a beautiful constituency but if we be not careful its waterway from binfield cut in the south to the thames in the north will become open sewer i have pledge to resident in cookham hurley the walthams bray binfield warfield winkfield and north ascot that i will fight tirelessly to clean up their river i look forward to work with every single of my colleague in this house over the next few year to help make that happen 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i to make my maiden speech and may i congratulate you on your election i also congratulate all those who have speak for the time today and over the last week the speech we have hear have be an incredible guide to the uk and should make we all proud of the country we collectively represent i offer my congratulation to   the hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds   on his contribution and wish he well in his time in the   house may i say as an mp at the other end of the elizabeth line and a carry on fan that i accept his invitation to dinner 
 may i pay tribute to my immediate predecessor there be my right hon friend   the member for east ham sir stephen timms now represent a small version of that seat he mark year as an mp this year and i know he be well respected in this house he be a well know figure to local people and be recognise as a diligent constituency mp indeed canvass the area i gain from he the most common question be where ’s stephen as a former councillor in his constituency i want to thank he for his support 
 i also follow on from lyn brown who retire at the election after year service in this house and an impressive year total elect service to the borough of newham i know lyn make a big impact in parliament and leave a strong legacy i want to thank she for all her support in the last few year especially during the election her support and advice have be invaluable and i know that support other members be part of her record in this place 
 west ham and beckton have a long history but this be a new seat make up of the southern half of the old west ham and the beckton and dock area of the large east ham seat the area have have multiple constituency over the year include at point ernest bevin ’s old south london seat of woolwich east which take in north woolwich the part of kent that be north of the thames a curious but often forget bit of history with a completely baffle county border 
 other who have represent part of this area in recent time include jim fitzpatrick and the irrepressible tony banks but the labour mp to represent here be the original keir keir hardie the found father of the labour party who be elect to parliament in west ham south in 
 in will thorne the founder of the union that be today gmb which be found in canning town in the heart of my constituency be elect to the same seat when he be elect there be just labour mp thing have move on somewhat since then in fact i be tell that more mp be member of the gmb than be member of the conservative party i thank they for demonstrate that so beautifully this afternoon i say this not to be controversial but mainly to drum up some canvass support for the next election 
 this be a big legacy to take on because west ham and beckton have be at the heart of the labour movement ’s history for over a century it be also at the heart of this country ’s economic history it contain the royal docks which be the centre of much of the country ’s shipping and trade until their decline and closure in the early 1980s the area be also a hub for manufacturing and infrastructure much of which but not all have since go beckton gas work may now be primarily remember for its spoil heap which become beckton alp and its time ski slope open by princess diana or as a film location for many movie and music video most notably full metal jacket 
 beckton be however still the site of europe ’s large sewage treatment plant he be not here any more but i be hop that might reassure my hon friend   the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall   a little bit it be a key part of bazalgette ’s work to clean   up london in the victorian era and today be part of the thames tideway tunnel sadly river pollution be still a topical issue century on as be so eloquently outline by   the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller 
 many industry have go and shipbuilde at harland wolff and the thames ironwork be just a memory although the local football team the ironwork which start in west ham be do all right but company in some traditional industry include britvic and tate lyle still have big local factory at the heart of the community and that be the constituency be also a key element of london ’s economic future the excel exhibition centre bring in visitor every year london city airport be london ’s most central airport and be important to the city of london we be also the new home of london city hall and have london ’s only enterprise zone which aim to create new job and ten of thousand of new home on brownfield site education be also thrive include at the university of east london and the london design engineering university technical college 
 locally we like to celebrate our heritage and you will find many park building and road name after local hero from the art sport politic and public life such as local boxer and footballer the speedway star of the 30 40s and 50 who use to thrill on the racetrack at the old west ham stadium in custom house and local factory worker and suffragette leader minnie baldock who found the london branch of the women ’s social and political union the same go for momentous event in london ’s history the meeting in of mahatma gandhi and charlie chaplin be mark by the gandhi chaplin memorial garden which be on the site of the house where they meet 
 most recently to mark the move of city hall we honour sri lankan world war veteran and pioneer race relation campaigner kamal chunchie who fight for well life for the local black and asian community and who in found the coloured men ’s institute where city hall now stand to far that aim he speak to the diversity of my constituency we be of the most diverse place in the country with community from every part of the world work and live alongside another it be what make the area such a great place to live and to represent each community that arrive add to the mix but also join in those long stand east london tradition of hard work community spirit and plain speak 
 kamal chunchie also remind we that while much focus be place on the change that have happen since there have be diversity much long in the 1920s can town have the large black community in london migration have be a fact of east london life for century german immigration into east london in the victorian era be part of my family history the debate around those who choose to make the uk their home be frequently too narrow and too often drive by populist voice we forget our history at our peril but east london be a testament to its vibrancy 
 my constituent do not lack ambition aspiration or talent they have it in inspirational quantity but too often they lack opportunity poverty be a real issue and in recent year have become much bad locally we have see child go to event in the hope of get food because they be hungry parent sleep in shift   on mattress on the floor because there be not enough room for the whole family to have bed and child force to do their homework in the bathroom because there be no other space for they to do it this government be elect on a mandate for change for many of my constituent that be not an aspiration it be a necessity my early labour predecessor be send here to represent those who have no voice those who need to be lift out of poverty and those who deserve a well life i be under no illusion more than a century on that demand be still real i have be send here to support change and to fight to improve life 
 it be my great regret that my father be no long alive to see i elect it would have mean a lot to he his advice to i be make sure you always do your good because no can ask more of you in my election acceptance speech i promise my good to my constituent and i repeat that promise today i will do the good i can for everyone in west ham and beckton and i will give my good to this house too i believe that together we can achieve the absolute good for our country and the people of my constituency the people of west ham and beckton deserve no less 
 i be just be honest honesty in politic 
 my hon friend   the member for southend west and leigh david burton sampson   make a very important point that we should all heed about civility in politic he speak about the diverse community spirit in his area but i be not go to even begin to compete with he on how impressive the coastline be in my landlocked suburban constituency 
 the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller   speak about how special and sunny her constituency be she begin a new competition now it be not only who have the most beautiful constituency but the sunny i be very touch by her recognition of the importance of family for both inspiration and practical support in politic 
 my hon friend   the member for peterborough andrew pakes   speak about his co operative and trade union value which i think many of we labour members share i do not know until he speak about the connection between peterborough and mustard so that be something i have learn today i think that his focus on the promise of new town really sum up our sense of optimism for the future there be the idea of be proud of ’s heritage and honest about the challenge that we face but he be also ready to achieve more in the future with a government who support he i wish he great stability in his seat 
 the hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds   give a particularly rich history of his constituency which go from bridge to carry on movie and he also mention the spice girls i think a spice girls cd be the i ever buy but he may not know what a cd be that sum up the different perspective we come from 
 my hon friend   the member for west ham and beckton james asser   speak about the royal docks where i spend much time in a previous role work at city hall i see the great potential that that area of the capital city have he eloquently set out the combination of heritage and diversity past and present that make his constituency such a lively and wonderful place to represent i make he an offer when he be jump on the elizabeth line to visit the hon member for maidenhead he can stop off at west ealing to say hello to i 
 the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi   speak honestly about the importance of keep people in this place on their toe that be right the electorate do keep we on our toe and of the great benefit of our system be the way in which we be bring down to   earth every time we go back to our constituency on thursdays or fridays however great and important the debate in this place be when we knock on that door or sit down in our surgery we be bring right back down to earth it be a great feature of our political system and she be right to draw attention to it 
 my hon friend   the member for kettering rosie wrighting   speak about how proud she be of the history of the place that she now represent and where she grow up i be very move to hear she speak about her mum ’s role as a local youth worker and how that inspire she to do what she be do in life i wish she well as of the young mps in this place 
 my hon friend   the member for wirral west matthew patrick   speak about the natural beauty of his constituency he be not the member to do so today and the passion of the people there his comment about politic be as much about listen as speak be particularly thoughtful we should all bear that in mind in this place he make an important point about learn from those with whom we disagree or maybe only appear to disagree and about break down barrier through listen and have conversation 
 my hon friend   the member for york outer mr charters   speak about business and voluntary project in his constituency he underscore how important it be that taxpayer money be treat with respect i know that the resident of york outer will be very well serve by the excellent new mp we hear from today 
 my hon friend   the member for earley and woodley yuan yang whom i enjoy campaign with during the general election manage to inject some humour into economic which be quite an achievement for a maiden speech i be not even go to begin to try to replicate that in my comment just now but she speak passionately about the importance to those in her constituency of have access to nature and affordable housing i know from what she say particularly about her personal experience that she will be a true champion for break down barrier to opportunity 
 finally we hear from my hon friend   the member for falkirk euan stainbank and it be worth the wait to hear his wonderful speech he give a fantastic whistle stop tour of his constituency and make many excellent recommendation of where to eat and drink next time we be in the area what really come across be how connected he be to the community he represent through his neighbour his friend and his family he use a phrase that sum up well what i and other government members want to do unite and serve 
 those be all the maiden speech we have today it be a truly excellent tour of not just the country but the talent we have in this place follow the general election i wish all hon member very well for however many year they spend in this place 
 we hear from other member about the substance of the bill include the shadow ministers they both seem a bit confused about whether they support the obr and the bill i be glad that they confirm that they support the bill and will not vote against it but at point   the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies   seem to defend liz truss over her handling of the economy he must be pretty much the last person in the country willing to do so it be    certainly brave of he we government member be clear on why the obr be so important and what its role should be the bill set out to strengthen that 
 the hon gentleman ask what the purpose of the fiscal lock might be the fiscal lock will prevent the sidelining of the obr by give it the power to start an assessment if the government announce fiscally significant policy without i remind he that the current shadow chancellor say at the time of the disastrous mini budget that some of the difficulty be cause by the lack of a forecast so this be something that the opposition agree with 
 the shadow minister also ask about the definition of an emergency we be very clear that in emergency for instance during the pandemic it may be necessary for the government to take rapid action in those case it would not be appropriate to hold back the response to the emergency until a forecast could be produce finally he ask whether the obr report trigger by the fiscal lock will be publish i can answer he simply they will that be set out in section of the original budget responsibility and national audit act 
 i welcome the support from the lib dem spokesperson   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney for the bill she ask about the definition of significant a point also raise by my hon friend   the member for walthamstow ms creasy the threshold set out in the draft charter for budget responsibility which we have on the gov.uk website be of gdp in any single financial year the purpose of the legislation be to prevent large irresponsible fiscal announcement that could undermine economic stability and that require a threshold target at fiscally significant announcement that be why we have choose that figure in the draft legislation and the draft text publish on gov.uk 
 let i mention other member who speak in the debate i welcome the support of   the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan   for the bill i think that his only criticism be word in the terminology and we can probably live with that he say that he be nauseous from hear we talk about be a government of service but he may have to get use to feel nauseous because we will proudly be a government of service every day that we have the honour to serve 
 finally i be glad that this be not an exceptional debate in which   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   do not make an intervention i welcome his support for the bill and for the government ’s wide action in resolve the junior doctor industrial dispute i reassure he that like my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury i recognise the importance of work with political representative from all nation in the uk 
 as my right hon friend say at the beginning of this debate a crucial step to achieve sustain economic growth be deliver economic stability this bill will help provide that stability and ensure that fiscal responsibility be not only embed in our approach to government but lock into how government work from this point on it will make sure that there be always proper scrutiny of the government ’s fiscal plan reinforce credibility and trust and make sure that no government can ever again play fast and loose with the public finance the bill be a key step in fix the foundation   of our country as we set out to get the economy grow and to make family across britain more secure and well off 
 we now know that the conservatives call the election to run away from the problem that they have cover up rather than take the tough decision to fix they while they may have run away from the problem that they create they can not run away from their record in office people in britain will not forget the last government ’s recklessness in which show just how much damage unfunded spending commitment can cause budget responsibility will never be optional under labour as it be under the conservatives we have bring fiscal responsibility back into the heart of government and we will hardwire it into law through our fiscal lock that be what this bill will achieve this bill will draw a line under the economic recklessness of recent year and make it clear that it must never be allow to happen again budget responsibility underpin our national mission to make people across britain more secure and well off for that reason and other i commend this bill to the house 
 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read a time 
 it be a pleasure to see the hon lady in her position and to have work with she many time on these issue in the past across these benches and in other format as the foreign secretary and i have already outline we take robust action against russia ’s shadow fleet alongside ally at the european political community we will continue to explore further option to strengthen our sanction include in the energy sector and the foreign secretary do indeed raise the issue at his meeting in mangalore

 hear hear 
 order 
 that stuart anderson wendy chamberlain samantha dixon chris elmore vicky foxcroft rebecca harris jessica morden jeff smith and mark tami be member of the committee of selection until the end of the current parliament.—(mark tami 
 the deputy foreign secretary be ask 
 if he will set out a timeline for the potential recognition of a palestinian state 
 if he will support the immediate recognition of the state of palestine 
 we want a credible and irreversible pathway towards a state solution a safe secure israel alongside a viable sovereign palestinian state we be committed to recognise a palestinian state as a contribution to a peace process at a time that be most conducive to that process 
 may i associate myself with your remark mr speaker about john the doorkeeper who know that we have the same love of 70 disco 
 i thank my right hon friend for his reply i must press he far on government recognition of a palestinian state that should have be a starting point year ago i believe that recognition would level the play field and kick start the peace process as have be recognise by so many of our european counterpart recognition should not come at the conclusion what will the government do if israel refuse to entertain any move towards a state solution which it have persistently and vocally reject 
 i know that my hon friend have press these issue which be of huge importance to her constituent for many year no have a veto on recognition as i say we want it to be part of a process it do not deliver a state solution in and of itself but it be absolutely right that the palestinians be enable to have a sovereign state it be a just cause and we will work with other partner to bring that about 
 order can i just say to everybody that member be mean to speak through the chair please look towards i or the mic might not pick you up 
 i hear what the secretary of state say but do he agree that the immediate recognition of the state of palestine be vital to the uk ’s commitment to uphold international law and norm vital to the process require to bring about an immediate and just peace and vital to the notion that diplomatic mean and not violence be the way to resolve the conflict do he agree that failure to recognise the state of palestine have have and continue to have catastrophic implication for the people of palestine as they face what the international criminal court have describe as plausible genocide 
 the hon gentleman be right that peace will be achieve through a political solution not through military mean but i disagree that recognition itself will bring about peace the biden plan be on the table at the moment and we would like hamas and the israeli leadership to accept it that be what will give we a ceasefire and get we to a place where we can achieve that state solution 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 may i welcome the foreign secretary to his new position since this be the time that we have meet across the dispatch box since we swap side i welcome all his team especially   the hon member for lincoln hamish falconer who be previously a respected and effective official in both the ministries in which i serve as a cabinet minister 
 i urge the foreign secretary to avoid any suggestion of some sort of international legal moral equivalence between a terrorist murderer and the elect head of a democratic state in any question of an arm embargo i remind he that just a few week ago british arm and military personnel be defend our ally israel from missile launch by iran 
 let i begin by welcome the right hon gentleman to his position it be great to see he where he be and not on the government benches he will know that these be very serious issue and that the test under criterion 2c be whether there be a clear risk that be base on very careful assessment of the law he would expect i to pursue that with all sobriety and integrity and that be what i intend to do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the secretary of state will get bored of i continue to press he on the recognition of the state of palestine i hope not to test his patience but i know in my heart that it be what palestinians need to ignite hope state can not happen without that hope to unite palestinians behind a final cause that will stop the killing for good war have to stop but that be not peace peace be state he know that netanyahu reject it so when he speak to netanyahu do he talk about the state solution and in particular the recognition of palestine do he accept that if the uk follow the other country that have do this that would send a powerful message to both the palestinian people and netanyahu 
 let i reassure the hon lady that raise this issue do not test my patience she be absolutely right i reject and disagree with those in israel who say that there can be no state solution if there be no state solution there be either state or no state at all i recognise why this be a press issue and why she raise it but as i have say we will do it at the appropriate moment hopefully work with other partner as a road to the state that we desire

 in my week in the role i travel to israel and to the west bank and call for an immediate ceasefire something that none of my predecessor have do in my meeting with both leader i call for an immediate ceasefire and make the urgent case as have be describe for a credible and irreversible pathway towards a state solution 
 i welcome my right hon friend and all the team to their place i thank he for call for a ceasefire when he visit israel that have have a profound impact in my constituency do he agree that a permanent ceasefire in gaza be essential for the future of the people in gaza and would help to cool tension in the middle east in particular give the attack on the golan heights and the escalate tension between hezbollah and israel and even the houthis 
 my hon friend be right the death and destruction in gaza in intolerable the war need to end now it be also the case that give the escalation of tension in the region if the biden plan be adopt by both side we would see that escalation come down for life in gaza and across the region it be important that that plan be adopt now 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 the people of gaza face a humanitarian catastrophe humanitarian aid be a moral necessity almost of the population in gaza have be displace and the integrated food security phase classification ’s recent assessment find a risk of famine across the whole of gaza 
 i thank the minister for her answer last week i meet the palestinian ambassador to discuss the heartbreaking crisis in gaza since april the volume of aid cargo enter the gaza strip have decrease by around at the same time as hospital remain damaged or in many case destroy that be why i welcome the foreign secretary ’s commitment to resume united nations relief and works agency funding and his demand for a ceasefire in the region have resume that funding what step be the government take to allow that vital aid into gaza and help those so desperately in need 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue we be deeply concerned at a number of the development he mention the uk be provide and will continue to provide significant humanitarian support to gaza however we be also clear that israel must meet its commitment to flood gaza with aid”—that be vital 
 i very much welcome the foreign secretary ’s decision on the international criminal court and on unrwa funding this morning i meet oxfam which tell i and other members that when parliament   be in recess this summer up to people in gaza will be kill or injure up to a of they child give that will the minister outline what urgent step the government will take this summer to end this horror include end uk arm sale to israel 
 too many people have die in gaza and too little aid be get in we be clear that israel must take concrete step to protect civilian and aid worker in accordance with international humanitarian law this include deconfliction between military and humanitarian operation and support the minimum operating requirement of the un agency as well of course as the other matter my right hon friend the foreign secretary lay out include the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire 
 last week i meet some of my constituent in ealing southall who live in the hanwell broadway area they tell i about hanwell friends of sabastiya a friendship and support network between our corner of west london and a village in the north of the west bank my constituent have hear at hand how palestinians be suffer across the territory what difference will the decision to restart unrwa funding make to the life of ordinary palestinians and what discussion have the minister have with unrwa ’s commissioner general to maximise its impact for the palestinian people 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this matter because we be clear that unrwa be the only humanitarian organisation that be able to operate at the scale require in gaza the foreign secretary as hon member will be aware confirm to the house on   july   that the uk would resume funding to unrwa on the same day i meet unrwa commissioner general philippe lazzarini to understand more from he about the situation on the ground and the reform that unrwa be undertake we also talk about this government ’s release of £ in new fund to unrwa to support its lifesave work in gaza and the provision of basic service in the region 
 my constituent be appal by the death and destruction in gaza they know as we do that only an immediate permanent ceasefire in exchange for the return of the hostage will put an end to this unacceptable and unbearable suffering in the meantime despite the israeli government ’s promise to flood gaza with aid which the minister mention the reality be that they be put in place repeat and deadly obstruction what conversation have the government have with israel to ensure that the israelis end this denial of lifesave assistance 
 i know that my hon friend have a personal interest in this issue and indeed experience of it follow the humanitarian work in which she be involve before come to this place when the foreign secretary be in israel he press prime minister netanyahu to open all border crossing include rafah to facilitate a significant increase in aid and to allow its safe effective distribution within gaza and we will continue to press for that as a matter of urgency 
 despite the designation of al mawasi as a humanitarian safe zone there have be multiple israeli air strike which have kill dozen of civilian and wound many more and have result in the bombing of a compound belong to the charity medical aid for palestinians and the international rescue committee what discussion have the minister have with her israeli counterpart about stop any further attack on al mawasi where displace gazans be order to go by the israel defence forces for their own safety 
 i know that this issue be of personal concern to my hon friend and that he have visit the region many time for instance when he be the shadow minister for the middle east he have ask specifically about the question of civilian in the conflict we be aware that about of the population in gaza have now be displace some of they more than once we need civilian to be protect we need aid worker to be treat in accordance with international humanitarian law and we need to ensure that there be deconfliction as i say early those be matter on which we as the new government have be press 
 the world health organisation have warn that the lack of sanitation and clean water cause by the humanitarian crisis in gaza pose a real risk of polio spread undetected among its people will the uk government consider support a mass vaccination programme in gaza 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this matter which the foreign secretary and i discuss directly with dr ghebreyesus the head of the world health organisation yesterday my hon friend be right about the severe concern about polio and the need for a vaccination scheme and the world health organisation be work on such a scheme when population be not receive the food and nutrition that they require or clean water the potential for infectious disease obviously increase but the uk have provide significant food and nutrition support as well as shelter and other essential material we will continue to do that and indeed to work with the world health organisation on these important matter 
 while the eye of the world be rightly on the shocking dystopian situation in gaza we should not forget the humanitarian situation in the west bank where a largely defenceless population be be ever more persecute and expose to violence and be see their home and land steal may we please have a comprehensive set of sanction against violent settler the organisation that support they in their activity and those who be complicit at a state level in what they be do 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for raise this issue the health and wellbeing of those in the west bank be another of the issue that i discuss with commissioner general lazzarini of unrwa because we be concerned about it as would be expect we be keep all sanction regime under review include this and we remain concerned about not only the position of the population but the long term issue surround a state solution which be mention early 
 the government have announce a strategic defence review but the challenge face by the uk in the mid-21st century be military relate development relate and diplomacy relate may i have an assurance that the foreign office will have a distinct role to play in the strategic defence review especially in the light of the conversation that we have just have which have show the complexity of the uk ’s global posture in the century 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his point of course all these issue be strongly related we be absolutely determined to work with colleague in defence as well as across the whole government so that we ensure that we be put our country ’s interest and above all protect our security the responsibility of any government 
 in recent month hamas have target israel ’s kerem shalom good cross with rocket and mortar to prolong the misery of their own people they be also estimate to have spend $ on construct their terror network by misappropriate aid do the minister accept that hamas will always prioritise conflict with israel over the wellbeing of their own citizen in gaza and that more step need to be take to stop the misappropriation of aid by hamas 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his question of course aid material must always be provide directly to those in need particularly in a situation of humanitarian catastrophe which be currently the case in gaza it be incredibly important that food and nutrition clean water other form of sanitation medicine and shelter be provide directly to those in need it be absolutely fundamental that they must not be misappropriate of course these be issue that we have discuss with unrwa and other aid agency that be involve in the region 
 key to end the humanitarian crisis in gaza be stop the sale of weapon to those who have show that they be prepared to use they indiscriminately against civilian it have be suggest that the government will continue to sell defensive weapon but give that israel define its entire campaign as defensive how do they propose to tell we at the end of the review on international humanitarian law how many of the civilian kill be kill with defensive weapon as oppose to offensive weapon on what legal basis would such a determination be make 
 the hon member will be well aware that this be a legal process and have to be comply with this government be absolutely clear that we must act with integrity and ensure that we be follow all the legal procedure as the foreign secretary set out last week in the house and have set out this morning 
 as shadow foreign secretary the secretary of state urge david cameron to publish the fcdo ’s formal legal advice on whether israel be breach international humanitarian law in gaza do the new ministerial team   still think there be a compelling case for publish the government ’s legal advice and will the government be publish it 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his question the foreign secretary have be crystal clear that he will be as transparent as he possibly can he will ensure that parliament be fully update on these matter 
 i thank the minister for that response if we want to improve the humanitarian situation in gaza it be quite clear what the free world have to do get rid of hamas who be murderer and terrorist they hide in school and hospital and they hide among civilian they be the people who be bring death to palestine if we want to give palestinians the humanitarian aid that we should give they we have to get rid of hamas 
 of course this government recognise that hamas have use civilian as human shield we be deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation and i set out our response to that a few moment ago we need to ensure that civilian be protect and we will continue to press for that as a matter of absolute urgency 
 whether he plan to review the sanction regime against russia 
 i thank my hon friend for his question this government be determined to increase the pressure on russia and support ukraine we will keep our russia sanction regime under close review and will go far to reduce russia ’s capacity to wage war   the government have already take further action include through the european political community by sanction an additional ship as part of effort to disrupt and deter russia ’s shadow fleet in my early meeting i have raise our russia sanction consistently with my counterpart and i will continue to work with our close ally in europe and united states 
 the uk have sanction individual and entity since russia ’s unlawful full scale invasion of ukraine yet since there have be just instance of uk law enforcement securing sanction fund what discussion be the minister have with his counterpart across government to ensure that those who evade sanction be hold to account and that money hold unlawfully be secure for the public purse 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that important question this government will not hesitate to take firm action to close loophole and to strengthen the enforcement of sanction he will understand that i will not comment on future designation or enforcement action as i have say we have already take some early step on the shadow fleet but he be right there be much more to do whether to improve compliance or to target those who enable sanction individual to evade our sanction and i will of course keep the house closely update 
 i thank the foreign secretary for his early statement call on the russian government to release the british citizen vladimir kara murza will he look at what further sanction might be use to put pressure on the russian government to release he and other political prisoner such as the american journalist evan gershkovich 
 the right hon gentleman be right to raise this important question we call for the release of all those detain in russia on political ground include those imprison for their opposition to russia ’s illegal war in ukraine we have meet many of the family of those concern and we will continue to take this very seriously

 i thank my right hon friend for his response i recently meet a number of member of the grow indian population in my constituency of livingston and they be very clear with i that if we get our india uk relation right over the come or year it will be of huge benefit to both country do the foreign secretary agree that the signing of the technology and security initiative within just a month of come into office show that we be work internationally to drive our economy and secure our country 
 my hon friend will be pleased to hear that the trade secretary announce the government ’s intention to continue trade talk with india just yesterday and i be sure there be more we can do to reduce barrier between our country 
 the right hon gentleman have visit india and he will know that the previous government have clearly get a long way towards a free trade agreement but that it be stall because of the indian general election and then our general election there be some stick point and i wonder if he could update the house on his discussion on remove those stick point so that we can unlock the free trade deal that those on both side of this house want to see 
 the hon gentleman have great experience in these matter but i disagree with he slightly he will remember that the previous government set a timetable and say that we would have a trade agreement by diwali but i be afraid the question be which because successive diwalis pass and we do not get i be very pleased that the trade secretary have set out that we be go to continue negotiation and of course these issue come up with my counterpart in delhi 
 we now come to shadow minister alicia kearns welcome 
 thank you mr speaker the foreign secretary rightly visit india to discuss a trade agreement between our country the labour party regularly call for human right to be part of that uk india trade deal will he therefore update the house on whether he secure say agreement during his visit 
 on human right we on the conservative benches welcome the fact that the foreign secretary raise with his counterpart the case of jagtar singh johal a british national whom the un have determine to be arbitrarily detain with report that he be subject to torture will the foreign secretary confirm before the house today that he still believe as he do a month ago that jagtar be be arbitrarily detain will he today publicly call for jagtar ’s release just as from this dispatch box he repeatedly urge the last foreign secretary to do will he meet jagtar ’s family as lord cameron do finally have adopt the foreign affairs committee ’s recommendation of a special envoy for britain ’s wrongly detain abroad when will he announce that somebody have be appoint 
 the hon lady have raise these issue over many year and this be a very serious case i remain absolutely committed to push for fast progress and to resolve this issue i of course raise it with the minister of external affairs in india last week we continue to raise our concern particularly about allegation of torture and the right to a fair trial of course i will meet the family over the come week 
 what discussion he have have with his iranian counterpart on alleged human right violation in that country 
 iran ’s continue repression of woman and girl ethnic and religious minority and human right defender be unacceptable we will continue to work with international partner to hold the regime to account include at the un committee later this year 
 the iranian authority have be systematically target bbc persian staff and their family in an attempt to intimidate they into stop their work as journalist freedom of the press be a fundamental right for people all over the world so will the foreign secretary and his colleague commit to work across government with the culture secretary to revisit the previous cut to bbc persian and look to increase funding for the vital work that the service do 
 that be a very important question iran clearly remain an extremely hostile environment for journalist who face harassment arbitrary detention and long prison sentence we will raise this issue with the new iranian government when they be form as the hon member will know they be have their inauguration today so there be no ministers yet for i or the rest of the foreign office team to talk to the foreign office currently provide a quarter of the bbc world service budget and we will no doubt look at that as part of the wide budget review 
 i welcome the minister to his place as we be tragically remind again this weekend the islamic revolutionary guard corps be a destructive malign and terrorist force that be operate through proxy in the middle east include hamas and hezbollah will the minister please update the house on the ongoing work to proscribe the irgc which the conservative sadly fail to do when they be in government will he please also reassure the house that the uk continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with israel against the irgc ’s continue aggression 
 the government recognise the threat that the irgc pose and we will take the necessary measure to counter it at home and abroad we will keep the list of proscribe terrorist organisation under careful review but it would not be appropriate to comment on whether an organisation be under consideration at this time iran continue to destabilise the middle east through its support for its proxy and partner and we will work with international partner to challenge that destabilising activity 
 what step he be take to help strengthen nato 
 of my predecessor ernest bevin be instrumental in set up nato and that be why our commitment to nato be unshakeable the washington summit demonstrate that nato be big strong and more united than ever the prime minister and the defence secretary continue to engage with ally and we be pleased to make our commitment to of gdp for defence spending

 do the foreign secretary share my concern that the dominant strand in the us republican party be at the moment fall into the trap of renew isolationism what can we do to try to impress on our american ally that if they turn away from nato they will only postpone a conflict that could otherwise be avoid completely 
 i know that the right hon gentleman speak from immense experience on these matter he will recognise that there be range of opinion on these issue within both political party in the united states i be very pleased that donald trump speak recently to president zelensky and that a supplemental $ of aid to ukraine be find recently 
 do the foreign secretary agree that ukraine join nato be vital not only to ukraine ’s security but to the security of all european country 
 it be absolutely right that at the nato summit we be able to set out that irreversible pathway to membership for ukraine and that nato be able to come together and speak with voice 
 i be proud to have serve on nato operation in both bosnia and kosovo the of gdp commitment will strengthen our tie within nato will the foreign secretary commit to a timeline at the early opportunity to ensure that we do not have to cancel any defence project and that we have the of gdp on defence spending as soon as possible

 as soon as i come into office i commission new advice on israel ’s compliance with international humanitarian law in the context of war in gaza we be oblige to look at that advice under criterion 2c for item export that be an ongoing process i pledge to update the house as soon as i can on this very serious matter 
 i welcome the government ’s change approach to the devastating conflict in gaza and the fact that the review be order soon after the foreign secretary ’s appointment will the foreign secretary confirm that if the review be to conclude that israel be breach international law all action include halt arm sale would be consider as part of the government ’s proportional response 
 criterion 2c of our strategic export licensing criterion be a clear risk of breach of international humanitarian law careful assessment have to be make there be a then a legal process to enable we to reach a conclusion of course with all sobriety and integrity i intend to do that and i will update the house as soon as i can

 can the minister be clear about this the judgment or opinion give by the icj be quite clearly that the occupation of gaza the west bank and east jerusalem be illegal the settlement policy be illegal do the government accept that view and if they do what action will they take to ensure that appropriate sanction be take against israel include end arm supply to ensure that that judgment be carry out and that the people of palestine can live in peace and not under occupation
