the minister may be aware that sse be support more than new home in rural scotland to aid energy   infrastructure development do he agree that the snp scottish government ’s failure to get a grip on our rural housing crisis be a major barrier to infrastructure development and will he urge sse to expand the scheme into my constituency where we have key project around the community of killearn lochearnhead tyndrum and crianlarich 
 i thank my hon friend for paint a well picture than the paint by conservative members 
 shortly after the election in august i meet a couple of former teacher colleague who be still in the profession and they just look broken it be really difficult to see because they have be math teacher for a long period of time when i become a teacher they inspire i to persevere to reflect on the bad day and to have well lesson to see they so feed up and so disenchanted with be a teacher be really difficult and we have to change that i emphasise again to the minister that it be really important that we ensure that we support teacher mental health i be go to intervene on   the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds   to ask he whether he recognise that happy and support teacher lead to happy and support young people which be really important 
 it be a pleasure to speak in this important debate and express my support for the bill for far too long school child have bear the brunt of academisation fortunately the labour government in wales reject this model but have be a teacher on the border for most of my work life and a national executive member of the nasuwt i have see at hand the negative impact of academy become the default model while local authority have be sideline 
 since the introduction of the academies act the freedom for academy and free school to set their own pay term and condition have lead to the exploitation of teacher for example teacher at ark school be expect to work hour more annually than a maintain school teacher while earn £ less per hour the lack of national consistency not only allow these school to undervalue and overwork staff but undermine basic right such as pension scheme maternity and sick pay our bill will tackle those disparity by extend the statutory pay and condition framework to all teacher in academy ensure great consistency and fairness between academy and maintain school 
 there be also the issue of admission policy too many school misuse their control over admission to break with inclusive local authority policy select what they consider to be a more favourable intake of student the bill ’s extension of the power to direct admission to academy will ensure that local authority can secure place for hard to place and vulnerable student rather than allow academy to exercise shameful selective admission furthermore by end academy presumption the bill take a significant step towards increase academy accountability empower local authority to well serve the need of their community particularly help send student and reduce reliance on unaffordable independent provider 
 i hope to see the severe disparity between teacher pay and the high salary of academy ceo review and address in future education legislation we must ensure that funding be direct where it be most need to teach and learn this bill mark an historic step towards create an accountable and fair education system that will benefit all our child 
 the resolution freedom have warn that as a result of cut in pip people could lose about £ a month with the poor family hit the hard give that child live in pip receive household and of they be already live below the poverty line how can the government justify push more disabled people and child into poverty rather than pursue fair alternative such as a wealth tax on asset worth more than £ which would raise £ time as much as the suggest saving from the propose cut be austerity really the change that people vote for 
 i have to announce to the house that mike amesbury the former member for runcorn and helsby have be grant the chiltern hundred the recall process would have begin once the time limit for all route of appeal have be reach it be now no long relevant but for the convenience of the house i will as be customary arrange for the notification from the court to be place in the votes and proceedings 
 order 
 that on the day of march the speaker do issue his warrant to the clerk of the crown to make out a new writ for the electing of a member to serve in this present parliament for the county constituency of runcorn and helsby in the room of michael lee amesbury who since his election for the say county constituency have be appoint to the office of steward and bailiff of his majesty ’s chiltern hundred of stoke desborough and burnham in the county of buckinghamshire.—(sir alan campbell 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to introduce the warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce the warm home plan 
 our warm home plan will upgrade up to home with technology such as heat pump solar panel and insulation help family to low bill and improve their home last week we allocate £ to local authority and social housing provider to help low income household and social housing tenant we will publish further plan follow the spending review 
 the warm home plan deliver a welcome uplift in resource for domestic energy efficiency failure by government energy company and local authority over a number of year have leave my constituent pay huge energy cost with poor connectivity failure to install smart meter or smart meter not work when they be instal and not fit for purpose electric heating system in the braes village do the minister   agree that the government must do all they can to end fuel poverty and will he meet i to discuss how to hold accountable those who be responsible for the ongoing issue in my constituency 
 my hon friend raise a number of important issue it be about have a tough regulator in ofgem it be about smart meter that work and it be about every decision the government take seek to tackle fuel poverty that be why i be incredibly pleased that we announce the extension of the warm home discount to an extra family with an extra £ next winter to help family that be what this labour government be all about 
 i welcome the energy efficiency measure that my right hon friend mention which will really make a difference to many family in the future but what can the government and energy provider do to help family struggle to pay their energy bill today 
 my hon friend speak with great expertise about these issue she will know that the minister for energy consumers my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh put in place with the energy company £ this winter to help family struggle with their bill we also want to see ofgem proceed with the plan to relieve the debt that many family face because the debt overhang from the cost of living crisis that we see after russia ’s invasion of ukraine still blight many family in our country if we move forward on all those front we can tackle these issue 
 i strongly support all effort to increase energy efficiency and bring down bill be the secretary of state concern about the potential unforeseen consequence of raise the minimum level of energy performance certificate to c for long term rent accommodation but not do so for short term let and own property will that not create an incentive in community such as our for people to go to airbnb or home ownership rather than provide affordable home for local people 
 the hon gentleman raise an important issue i believe i be right in say i be check with the minister for energy consumers that as part of the consultation on energy efficiency we be look at the issue of short term let which have be raise in the past he be right to draw attention to what we be do here because this measure which the last government propose and then back away from a pattern we be see quite a lot at the moment will take up to family out of poverty it be a basic principle if someone be rent a home and they pay their rent   on time they have a right to live in decent warm accommodation 
 what recent estimate his department have make of the cost of decarbonise the electricity grid by 
 what recent estimate his department have make of the cost of decarbonise the electricity grid by 
 our clean power mission will end our dependence on volatile fossil fuel market give the british people the energy security they deserve and drive job and investment into our community we be already see the impact of the clean energy transition with thousand of job be create across the country in ccus carbon capture usage and storage hydrogen and offshore wind and more nationally significant solar power be approve in month than the previous government manage in year 
 the london power tunnel project have be a positive story locally in bexley as national grid have work with the community to minimise disruption with a plan to restore the site however the labour government ’s planning reform have lead developer to propose extensive industrial battery storage facility on a nature conservation area and farmland locally in bexley that do not meet fire safety guidance while we need infrastructure do the minister agree that weaken green belt protection against resident wish and damage nature in the process to meet labour ’s unrealistic grid target will result in bad development in inappropriate place 
 i be glad the hon gentleman draw attention to the london power tunnel my right hon friend the secretary of state and i have visit they recently and they be a fantastic example of engineering and of what we can achieve if we set ambitious target in this area i gently disagree with the hon gentleman on the wide point however as we be go to have to build infrastructure across the country to get the benefit of the renewable energy that we be generate and battery storage be important for that of course community have a voice through the planning system and it would be wrong for i to comment on individual application but the hon gentleman and his colleague must remember that we can not simply block every infrastructure project that need to be build we need to build for the economic growth of the country and for our energy security 
 once again the minister have fail to answer the question about the cost estimate but we do know that the government ’s dogma drive target will drive up cost and that we will see pylon and substation impose in walpole in my constituency and across the country against the wish of local people that will damage our countryside and it rely on chinese supply chain which the energy secretary visit only over the weekend when will the government realise that their approach of rule out underground option and attempt to buy off local community on the cheap rather than listen to they will only drive opposition to their plan 
 once again we hear from conservative members about all these grand plan that they wish they have do in the year that they be in government they could have move forward on undergrounde if they be so keen on it but of course they do not the   reality be that it be for individual company not we to set forward the design of individual project and cost estimate for undergrounding be or time more expensive 
 the bottom line on all of this be that the leader of the hon member ’s party early today move away from the commitment that she have make on net just a few year ago she say that 
 russia ’s invasion of ukraine have make it clear that rely on authoritarian regime 
 can make it 
 hard to heat our home 
 they recognise then the importance of this net transition now they be run away from how we deliver on it 
 i call the chair of the select committee bill esterson 
 uk electricity bill be the high in europe compare to gas evidence give to the select committee suggest that the government be absolutely right to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel and it be a shame that some opposition members have abandon an evidence inform approach to policymake can the minister confirm whether the government be consider rebalance the infrastructure levy on our energy bill as a way of reduce electricity bill in the immediate future and as a down payment towards and beyond 
 the select committee chair make an important point along with the minister for energy consumers my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh i be look at all option because it be important that we bring down bill and that we be build an energy system that protect we from the volatile fossil fuel market in the future there be trade off to be make when rebalancing that we need to be aware of in particular whether a diminish number of gas customer can pay bill if we be to transfer levy but we be look at all option and be of course look at how we review with ofgem the wide question of stand charge to make sure we bring down bill my hon friend be right to say of the journey that we be on and that the conservative party use to be on and on which there use to be consensus that our transition to net be important for energy security and for the climate but also for protect bill in the long term 
 the minister be clearly aware of the foolhardy decision by the opposition to abandon the political consensus on net but have he make an assessment of the cost to the consumer of pursue that disastrous path which would lock we into our dependence on pollute fossil fuel volatile oil and gas price and the whim of foreign dictator 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be important to recognise that where once there be consensus in this country on how we tackle the climate crisis and crucially how we deliver the economic and industrial advantage that consensus seem to have be splinter by the conservative party it be only year ago that the leader of that party make an important point which i agree with strongly when she say 
 if we get our strategy wrong we risk be leave on the backfoot as other country seize the advantage 
 the conservative party now wish we to be on the backfoot but we be determined that we will drive forward because that be the good policy for consumer economic growth and energy security 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government ’s rush to decarbonise the grid mean more hidden cost more curtailment payment more balance payment more subsidy and a high carbon price will the minister guarantee that our carbon price will remain low than the european price for the remainder of this parliament 
 i think the hon gentleman know more than anyone about the work that the previous prime minister theresa may do in this area work that his party be now move away from rapidly the conservatives be right then the only way for we to bring down bill deliver economic growth and tackle the economic opportunity be for we to be on this journey together conservative members use to strongly believe in that we will continue on that path because it be the right thing for the country to do 
 that be a long wind answer but the minister do not actually address the question and i think he just give away that it be labour ’s secret plan to increase the price of carbon a massive rise in the carbon price add hundred of pound to family bill and decimate british industry give labour ’s election promise to cut bill will he take this moment he can look up into the camera if he like to promise the country that by the next election bill will be low as labour promise yes or no 
 never mind long wind answer that be a very long wind question i have not reveal any secret plan but the conservatives have reveal their not so secret plan and i can tell the county that it be just as disappointing as the the country reject month ago we have be very clear that it be our commitment to bring down bill and we be determined to deliver on that unlike the conservative party which leave consumer across the country expose to volatile fossil fuel market the hon gentleman be right to point out that bill go up and up and up when his party be in government we will bring they down his party want to take we back to the fossil fuel casino but we will not do that 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to the mineworker pension scheme on the living standard of the recipient of that pension 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to the mineworker pension scheme on the living standard of the recipient of that pension 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to the mineworker pension scheme on the living standard of the recipient of that pension 
 this labour government have end the historic injustice of the mineworker pension scheme at the end of november last year the uprated payment for the pension scheme land for over miner and their family that be an average increase of on their monthly payment or an average additional £ a week 
 i thank the minister for her answer and for her hard work to increase payment to mineworker and their family across the country after dig for coal for many year miner and their family have receive an uplift of nearly £ a week in my constituency of blaenau gwent and rhymney however progress be still need on the staff superannuation scheme the trustee of that scheme confirm to i that the average age of pension member be so with time march on will the minister outline the next step to help member of the staff scheme 
 i thank my hon friend for his remark he be right to talk about the british coal staff superannuation scheme the initial focus of our work be on the mineworker pension scheme which be in our manifesto we have to work at pace on that commitment and we be work with the government actuary ’s department on how the surplus share arrangement will work go forward that big piece of work be under way but my hon friend be right to point to the ten of thousand of people who be in the bcsss i too have meet the trustee and we be work as fast as we can through the issue associate with that scheme the scheme be different they operate in different way but the government be the guarantor for both of they and i will reconvene trustee to continue discussion with they and take this matter forward 
 at the last general election i make a promise to ex miner in my constituency that a labour government would deliver justice on the mps investment reserve fund and return it to its member i be delighted that at the end of last year this government deliver provide a boost of more than to their pension however in my constituency there be more than bcsss member who be still really concerned about this issue so i would welcome the minister ’s answer on that can she reassure they and i that the trustee will continue to update the member of that scheme at the moment there be a degree of uncertainty on what progress can be make over the come month 
 i thank my hon friend for his concern for his constituent who be in the bcsss i be very receptive to the call from bcsss trustee i write to the chief secretary to the treasury at the end of last year to begin discussion we have receive a positive response from he and we be now take the next step to move this process forward 
 we be only partway there on the pension injustice for miner the british coal staff superannuation scheme have around member   who formerly work in mining industry include a number of my constituent they include many woman who be among the low pay in the coal industry my own mum work in the pit canteen can i assure my constituent enrol in the bcsss that transfer the £ investment reserve to its member be a priority for this government 
 my hon friend be right to point out that there be about people in this scheme about of they be woman unlike the mineworker pension scheme of which the vast majority of member be man the scheme be different and operate in a different way because in the bcsss have run deficit and be at risk so there have to be an intervention from government the scheme operate differently and have to be look at differently the government actuary ’s department team be work its way through the mineworker pension process and we be now work with official on this issue i be meet official later today to talk about it more to see what we need to do i stress that this be very complex we be talk about billion of pound worth of asset but we be absolutely receptive to call from the trustee and i will meet with they again soon 
 what progress he have make on achieve clean power by 
 we be drive forward at speed to deliver clean power by last week the government introduce the planning and infrastructure bill which will enable the big expansion of the grid for generation sweep away the connection delay and the queue that hold we back for too long under the last government and reform the planning system to speed up delivery we have also lay out for the time legislation to provide household near new or upgrade pylon £ a year off their energy bill for year as part of our commitment to deliver meaningful benefit for community host clean energy infrastructure 
 do the secretary of state agree that community energy have a vital role to play in the transition to clean and greener power will he accept an invitation to come to my constituency in north london to visit community energy barnet which be work on of the large community energy project in the country 
 i always like visit north london and i would very much like to accept an invitation from my hon friend he make a really serious and important point about community energy if we look at germany and denmark we see that they have do much well on community energy than we great british energy have an important role to play in this and we will say more about that in the come week 
 do the secretary of state share my concern about report of persistent misconduct by drax regard cut down old growth forest and burn it at its power station to be clear   this be a company that chop down pristine forest ship it halfway across the world to burn it in the united kingdom and claim that it be sustainable will he look again at the large amount of subsidy that have be approve by this government for that company 
 i do not know whether the right hon gentleman for whom i have great respect be present when the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks make a statement on precisely that issue on the impact on bill he will be delighted to know that under the new arrangement that this government agree there have be an absolute transformation in the scale of subsidy to drax it will be halve there be also a windfall tax when its profit go above a certain level which i be sure the right hon gentleman be in favour of and there be much high standard of sustainability he be right that we should take these issue seriously 
 the conservative party abandon the economy the nhs the justice system and immigration and now it be join its reform collaborator and other climate change denier in the dunce ’s corner do the secretary of state agree that unlike this government who recognise the triple benefit of the goal energy security a transition to renewable and job creation the conservative party have no solution for century britain 
 my hon friend should not be so shy and retire he make a really important point i listen to the interim shadow secretary of state   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie on the radio this morning he make net sound like a target dream up by i but it be not it be theresa may the former conservative prime minister who legislate for net by the hon member be her parliamentary private secretary at the time he be suppose to be the man implement it she set the target because it be the right thing to do so that we can have clean home grow energy get the job and protect future generation 
 the plan for a green generator at the peterhead power station in my constituency be shovel ready but they depend on approval for the acorn project at st fergus on   november   last year the minister for industry state in response to a question from i that more information would be available on the track project in the coming month give that month have pass can the secretary of state provide an update timescale and outline what the next step will be 
 i support the acorn project it be really important for reason that the hon member will understand the right time to make decision will be at the spending review in june 
 what discussion he have have with energy supplier on support for consumer 
 we know that people be worried about their energy bill and that too many be struggle to afford they we agree £ of industry support alongside our warm home discount to ensure that £ of support be available for household struggle with their energy bill this winter we will continue to take action to support consumer in the short term as we sprint towards clean power in order to bear down on energy bill for good 
 in my constituency a local hospitality business ’s energy provider e.on have behave appallingly by back billing and incorrectly billing leave that business nearly bankrupt while i welcome the new expand remit of the energy ombudsman we need to ensure that it have the capacity and power that it need to protect business would the minister meet i to discuss this case and what be the government do to ensure that our local business be not drive to bankruptcy by the outrageous behaviour of energy supplier 
 i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this case however there be clear rule in place to protect consumer from unfair back billing and energy company must comply with those rule i have meet energy uk the industry body and ofgem to reinforce our expectation that if rule be not comply with ofgem will take enforcement action the broad point be that we have to ensure that the energy market be work for consumer and be fair we be review ofgem to ensure that it have the mandate the duty and the power include the energy ombudsman that it need to be an effective and strong consumer champion 
 for the record i and my constituent be proud of the southern north sea development the large wind farm in the world begin under the last government however we be not happy about this government ’s rush to force our consumer to pay high bill to see as a result of vast subsidy farmer in a very important agricultural area of norfolk farm solar panel rather than the food that we need to ensure affordability and our security and to abandon agricultural leadership on net can the minister reassure my consumer that £ be adequate compensation for high bill and the defoliation of a large part of norfolk that be what have happen in the rush towards ill think out net target set in london without any consideration of local people 
 the past few year have show we why we must break our reliance on global fossil fuel market under the hon gentleman ’s government ’s watch energy price spiral and consumer across the country pay the price that be a reality that opposition members be happy with but it be not a reality that we think be tenable so we will sprint to clean power because that be the route by which we achieve energy security for the country and financial security for family we be on the right side of history and on the side of consumer opposition member be delude 
 in blackpool we have more than charity that be do incredible work support people with their mental health in   get back to work and also with the cost of living but too many people tell i week in week out that they can not afford to pay the bill what conversation have the minister have with energy company about support these charity will she agree to meet i to discuss this important issue 
 my hon friend be absolutely right charity and sector organisation play a vital role in get support to household which we know be struggle with bill part of the reason we think it be so important to agree £ of industry support be to make sure that we get additional support to household we be also consult on extend our warm home discount to more household so that more than people get help we will work with the energy sector to make sure that we use the vital network of charity to get that support to the household that need it 
 the price of gas be some low than it be at the beginning of this year and the secretary of state promise that bill would come down can the government say when bill will come down for consumer give that they be go up by on   april 
 i encourage the hon gentleman to check his fact the price cap go up which be disappointing for family because of the spike in wholesale price that be because of our reliance on global fossil fuel market interruption i will say it incredibly slowly for he so he can understand it be because of our reliance on global fossil fuel market we must break that reliance we have to wean ourselves off this rollercoaster of price spike and price fall which be harm consumer across the country the sprint to clean power will achieve that it be a shame that he can not see that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 consumer be concerned about the rise energy price cap what will the secretary of state do to strengthen exist energy scheme and initiate new scheme will it include deliver the £ reduction in energy bill that labour promise during the general election 
 we know that household be struggle with bill and be worried about they that be why we be do everything we can to bear down on bill we be do that not just because it be a manifesto commitment but because it matter to household across the country while we sprint to clean power we be clear that that be the route to bear down on bill we will support household whether it be the £ agreement we make with energy supplier the extension of the warm home discount to more than household or the debt support we be provide to consumer with energy debt we be take short term action let i be clear that the way we get ourselves out of this bind be by deliver clean power for consumer across the country 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the cop29   agreement 
 i thank my hon friend for her continued interest in this issue despite significant challenge cop29 agree a new climate finance goal and finalise guidance on international carbon market we would have like more progress in certain area such as on mitigation outcome we look forward to play an important role in the run up to cop30 in belém to ensure that more progress be make 
 tackle climate change should matter to all of we because it affect all of we at cop29 the uk lead the way on set strong climate target how be the minister ensure that measure be in place to track progress against our cop commitment how be she work with business local authority and industry to deliver on those target and drive investment 
 my hon friend be right we earn the credibility that enable we to show international leadership by deliver at home in due course we will publish a cross economy plan for meet our climate target which will outline the policy that be need to meet our nationally determined contribution and we be engage with a range of stakeholder on delivery through for instance the net council which have a very busy work programme and the local net delivery group 
 what assessment have the minister make of the cop29 commitment to triple finance for develop country from the previous goal of $ to $ a year by and what be the united kingdom ’s contribution to that sum 
 it be always a pleasure to answer question from the hon member we remain committed to international climate finance and to the new climate finance goal agree at cop29 the level of the uk ’s contribution will be consider in the spending review when we will also consider how we can maximise investment from the private sector 
 what step he be take to support the development of carbon capture and storage technology 
 what step he be take to support the development of carbon capture and storage technology 
 the £ of funding to which we commit in october will kick start the carbon capture usage and storage industry support thousand of job in our industrial heartland through the east coast and hynet cluster we continue to engage with important future project such as acorn in scotland and viking in the humber and we will make further announcement follow the spending review 
 as my right hon friend will recognise merseyside be a clean energy pioneer a hub of carbon capture and hydrogen technology the climate emergency be the challenge of our generation and that challenge   will be meet only through the collective endeavour of community across our country include mine in wirral west how be the government help our community to deliver good local energy project 
 my hon friend be entirely right about this we have learn over the last decade and more that this be the big job opportunity of the century nowhere be that more true than in the investment we be make in carbon capture usage and storage and i be confident that my hon friend ’s constituent will benefit a couple of week ago the confederation of british industry produce an important report that show that last year the net economy grow time fast than the economy as a whole the house should let that sink in because it tell we that if we turn our back on the net economy we turn our back on business job and investment 
 do my right hon friend agree that there be huge potential for carbon capture and storage to play a key role in our green energy ambition for scotland as we look towards the spending review do he agree that the acorn project present an excellent and efficient opportunity to invest in ccus and to reduce the carbon impact of industry across scotland because it will repurpose exist pipeline 
 i congratulate my hon friend he be a fantastic advocate for the acorn project of which we be hugely supportive track project be agree in last year ’s budget a fiscal event a fiscal moment and the government be consider those project ahead of the next phase of the spending review which will come in june but i do not think that anyone doubt the potential value of the acorn project not just to scotland but to the whole united kingdom 
 no who care about the future of our child and our grandchild will gainsay the importance of carbon capture but do the secretary of state not understand that he be undermine that good work notwithstanding his answer to my right hon friend   the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden by continue to subsidise the drax power station which be cut down forest in canada turn the wood into pellet and ship it thousand of mile across the atlantic to burn here that make nonsense of what he be try to achieve 
 i do not agree with the right hon gentleman for whom i have great respect the situation that we inherit from the last government mean that we have to consider matter such as security of supply and how we could secure the good deal for bill payer that be what we do and that be why we make the statement that we make on drax on long term however the right hon gentleman be entirely right we need to move away from unabated biomass and consider all the possibility to enable we to move towards net and that be what this government be do 
 will the secretary of state join i in congratulate the student from bourne community college who come to westminster yesterday to present their report on the future of hydrogen storage as a net approach to aviation do he   agree that student engage with science technology engineering and mathematic be excited about the potential of clean power and carbon capture and that proper funding for stem in our school will provide we with the next generation of scientist and engineer who can help we to achieve these goal 
 i join the hon lady in warmly congratulate the student from her constituency whom she mention i be sure that i speak for all member of the house when i say that when we meet young people who be engage in the potential of clean energy technology to transform our country and our world it be an incredibly important reminder both about its potential for job and about our duty to future generation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the inter governmental panel on climate change have make it clear that by we need to be remove tonne of carbon from the atmosphere every year if we be to stand a chance of keep below the ° target it be clear that carbon removal and not just carbon capture and storage will play a critical role in our avoid a climate disaster in the face of the conservative party once again embrace climate denialism what step will the government take to support the research development and deployment of carbon removal technology to ensure that british company become leader in this emerge sector 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i can tell he that the minister for industry hold a roundtable with a whole range of industry voice on this precise topic last week he be right about this issue there be scepticism about ccs in some part of academia and elsewhere all the evidence that i have see from the climate change committee the ipcc and other include the international energy agency be that ccs technology have a crucial role to play on something like of emission he be also right to say that carbon removal be the next stage of that journey and it be something that my department be heavily engage in 
 whether he be take step to maintain the role of nuclear energy within his energy security strategy 
 what step he be take to support the nuclear power sector 
 what step he be take to support the nuclear power sector 
 nuclear power be at the heart of our mission to make britain a clean energy superpower it be not just provide energy security but drive billion of pound in investment and create thousand of highly skilled job great british nuclear be on track to make final decision on its   small modular reactor competition this spring while a final investment decision on sizewell c will be make in the spending review 
 whether agree with the government ’s net target or not they will not be able to achieve they without nuclear energy play a significant role which be why i be delighted that the prime minister and the secretary of state choose to launch their nuclear strategy in my constituency i can only assume that my invite be lose in the post a key part of the nuclear fuel strategy be the nuclear fuel industry in this country from the aggressive action of russia and other country that have push western commercial provider out and dominate element of the nuclear fuel enrichment and manufacturing market we see that it be ever more important for our national security that we develop whole of lifecycle nuclear fuel production when will the government announce the concrete step that they will take as part of the strategy to improve the whole of lifecycle manufacturing of nuclear power 
 he need an adjournment debate 
 the hon gentleman make a good point the prime minister the secretary of state and indeed the minister for nuclear in the other place have visit the hon gentleman ’s constituency and see the good work that be happen there and just shy of £ from government grant have go into that work to help develop nuclear fuel which will be part of the future the big nuclear development at sizewell and hinkley smr and advanced modular reactor all need to be in the mix and he be absolutely right to make that point 
 many of my constituent be pleased to see the extension of heysham and late last year and they would like long term job for the future in the nuclear industry create in the north west do the minister agree that it be thank to this labour government that we be end the last government ’s legacy of no new nuclear be build 
 i completely agree the conservative party build no new nuclear in year small modular reactor will bring energy efficiency and economic growth to many part of this country we be work at pace and will make sure that we have the answer on smr shortly we will have the answer on sizewell in the spending review and of course nuclear will play a big role in the future 
 small modular reactor as the minister say will play an important part in deliver clean cheap and secure energy across this country however current rule require that any reactor must apply for regulatory justification as if nuclear power be an entirely new practice instead of an exist that delay reactor get online and lower energy bill for people across the country include in bury st edmunds and stowmarket by up to year will the secretary of state consider work with his cabinet colleague to simplify the system and recognise that nuclear energy technology be an exist practice thereby accelerate the deployment of small modular reactor 
 another adjournment debate 
 i will happily investigate far the issue that my hon friend have raise there be piece of work go on in this space the draft nuclear planning policy statement and the nuclear regulatory taskforce we want to make thing as easy as we can and i be very happy to talk to he far 
 small modular nuclear reactor be clearly the way forward for decarbonise the grid but be hold up by constant delay when do the minister expect to be able to announce the to be bring into operation and when do she expect it to actually start work 
 i be hop that it will take less than the year in which the previous government fail to deliver anything we will see the announcement on the smr in the spring our door be open to anyone who want to suggest build new nuclear in this country 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on   february the prime minister announce that he would take on the blocker and build new small modular reactor but do those blocker include his own government with essential work be delay and pause at sellafield possible job loss at the nuclear decommissioning authority and still no certainty for sizewell c due to a general fear in the industry that the spending review will stymie the ambition of great british nuclear be the big blocker to new nuclear in the uk not in labour ’s treasury 
 i be not sure how many time the hon member promise he would get to the final investment decision on sizewell under the last government i think he and his colleague promise that at least time in the house and of course it do not happen i gently repeat that the previous government manage no new nuclear in year and he himself admit that the government have move too slowly in get nuclear project off the ground we be work at pace and we will deliver the result of the competition in the spring sizewell c be also move at pace and we will have final answer in the spending review 
 we be go to run on a bit because we be behind we have hardly get through any question 
 what step he be take to support worker right in the renewable energy sector 
 for this government good pay and condition for worker and the role of trade union must be at the heart of the renewable energy sector because that be the only route to a fair transition since we come to office edf renewables have announce recognition agreement with major trade union we applaud it for its decision and we want other to follow suit through the office for clean energy jobs we be also work with industry and trade union to support fair pay term and condition in the sector 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer the employment rights bill be an historic step forward for worker but these right must go hand in hand with good job what action be he take to strengthen the uk ’s manufacturing capacity and supply chain to ensure that community such as mine in knowsley benefit from the transition to net 
 my hon friend be a brilliant advocate for her constituency and on this issue of manufacture job if we look at what this government be do from gb energy to the national wealth fund and the clean industry bonus we see that this government be determined to ensure that we manufacture in britain we care about where thing be make and we will make those good manufacture job happen 
 i call the father of the house 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the development of large scale solar farm 
 meet our clean power mission will require a significant increase in the deployment of both ground mount and rooftop solar project as well as consent record amount of ground mount solar we want to see a much great deployment of rooftop solar power we will soon publish the solar road map work that start under the previous government to bring together our next step in this area 
 the government say that only of agricultural land will be take up by solar farm but in the pipeline around gainsborough acre have already be put aside for solar farm with another announce a couple of week ago up to of my constituency which be the most arable and most fertile in the country i make quite reasonable request of the secretary of state will he consider application in the round rather than individually and look at their cumulative effect on food production and the local environment 
 under even the most ambitious scenario less than of agricultural land would be occupy by solar farm on the right hon gentleman ’s point about their be holistically plan the strategic spatial energy planning that we have take forward be important in have a coherent view of the entire energy system that be work that we should have do many many year ago we be now move at pace to do it but individual planning application be 
 i call luke murphy 
 now that the conservative party oppose large scale solar net and onshore wind i be tempt to ask the minister what he make of that party ’s new energy policy which be to take we back to the past rub stick together and hope for the good instead will he update the house on the progress of great british energy in deliver our clean energy mission 
 i think we have rehearse the argument about the absolute failure of the previous government over the past year the conservatives have just go far back today on gb energy i be delighted to be in aberdeen yesterday to join the board of gb energy for its board meeting the bill will soon we hope complete its passage through parliament it can then get on with deliver for the british people 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 britain produce of global climate emission china be the world ’s large emitter yet no uk energy secretary have visit it in year to make the case for it to do more that be why i have be in beijing make the case for climate action engagement not negligence be what fight for britain look like on climate as on so much else this government believe that britain can only protect our national interest by engage on the international stage 
 the bacton energy hub in my constituency be undergo a green transition which i support because i believe in protect our natural environment and boost our economy through net thing the conservatives seem to have abandon green hydrogen at bacton need wind power to be bring in from the coast will the secretary of state help to make that happen and will he visit bacton with i to see the potential for himself 
 this among many other be a very very important potential project and the hon gentleman be right to make the case for it green hydrogen be absolutely part of our energy mix in the future 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to nuclear energy i recently meet representative of newcleo a company develop small modular reactor use lead cool fast reactor technology that use deplete uranium and plutonium waste material of which we have an abundance from our exist nuclear programme will the secretary of state detail what he be do to ensure that the industrial strategy take account of all aspect of the nuclear jigsaw include the wide variety of technology on offer 
 clean energy be of the growth sector in the industrial strategy and will provide a core part of that strategy if anybody want to build new nuclear in this country our door be always open 
 last month with surprisingly little fanfare from the department or the secretary of state the climate change committee publish carbon budget among the more eyewatering recommendation be the figure put on the cost of meet the obligation £ over the next year frontloade that will be a net cost to industry every year until be that exorbitant   cost the reason that he cancel his department ’s review commission by his predecessor into the whole system cost of net 
 i deeply regret the direction in which the hon gentleman be go the climate change committee do incredibly important work we will look at cb7 but the big cost we face as a country be if we do not act on the climate crisis that be what would leave hundred of billion of pound of cost to future generation 
 the right hon gentleman might be content with sign our energy sovereignty over to the people ’s republic of china and he might be happy with his government ’s arbitrary target and ban push bill up and leave we more reliant on import and cost job but we think it be time for a new approach as the leader of the opposition say this morning focus on security and cost to the consumer not pie in the sky target with no plan to reach they will he recommission the review into the whole system cost if not what be he try to hide 
 it be the tory party that have an energy surrender policy surrender we to fossil fuel market control by petrostate and dictator the tories would keep we lock in to fossil fuel threaten billion of pound of investment in net and leave our child and grandchild a terrible legacy that be the conservative party in anti job anti growth anti business and anti future generation 
 i welcome the plan bring forward last week to provide money off for people live near new energy infrastructure do the minister agree that this be yet another thing that the conservatives promise but never have the ability to deliver 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we have move forward on deliver our plan that people host important infrastructure in their constituency should benefit from it the conservatives consult on it like so many policy that they talk and talk and talk about but fail to deliver over year we be move on with deliver it 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in the recent advice for its carbon budget the climate change committee highlight the urgency of ensure cheap electricity so that household can transition away from gas heating when will the government act to improve energy security and reduce cost for the household seek to adopt low carbon heating by reform policy cost on energy bill 
 as we discuss early the ccc raise an important issue that we need to look at the key question on this so call rebalancing be that it must be look at in the context of understand the principled case while also ensure that if we go down that or another route we do so in a way that be fair that be the work that my department be engage on 
 i have recently meet a number of family who be member of the british coal staff superannuation scheme while i know they will welcome the minister ’s early comment as have be say many be in their 70 and 80 and they be keen for answer could the minister expand on her early comment to say more about the next step and when my constituent might get a sense of the timeline and progress go forward 
 i thank my hon friend for his concern for his constituent as i say i be very receptive to call from bcsss trustee i write to the chancellor who send back a positive response and we be now take the next step in this process i will be reconvene trustee to meet and talk about it again 
 martin a disabled resident live in his park home in maidenhead after his boiler break down month ago he have face significant challenge he be unable to apply for the boiler upgrade scheme as park home do not get energy performance certificate and the national energy foundation which visit he week ago have still not provide he with a response will the secretary of state outline what support he can give martin and other elderly resident without heat or hot water 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question we be very aware of the issue with park home and industry support be provide to resident as we think about expand the warm home discount and the support we provide for household that can not afford their energy we will of course have park home in our mind 
 do the minister agree that community ownership project will be crucial to achieve our world lead net goal and will he come to edinburgh to see some of our fantastic community power project 
 yes that sound really good community energy be a crucial part of our energy future 
 the secretary of state and i be near neighbour will he take a short car journey to gainsborough to visit the new fusion site at west burton it be probably the most exciting development in green energy that we have ever have in this country create unlimited job and unlimited green energy will he join i in gainsborough 
 the right hon gentleman and i do not necessarily agree on everything but on this we do agree the transformation of the west burton site from a fossil fuel fire power station to a fusion power plant be an incredibly exciting project and we should all be battle for it 
 the minister may be aware that sse be support more than new home in rural scotland to aid energy   infrastructure development do he agree that the snp scottish government ’s failure to get a grip on our rural housing crisis be a major barrier to infrastructure development and will he urge sse to expand the scheme into my constituency where we have key project around the community of killin lochearnhead tyndrum and crianlarich 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he underline the importance not just of deliver on energy project but the wide economic benefit from build infrastructure the kind of infrastructure that the conservatives now oppose he be right that in order to deliver these project we need to see investment in rural community by the scottish government we will continue to press they on those issue 
 kent county council plan to introduce on street car charger over the next decade to put that in context kent have a population of people at this rate kent will have burn down by the time we all have electric on street car charging what can the secretary of state do to speed this up 
 the hon gentleman raise a really important issue roll out electric car infrastructure be incredibly important if he write to my department we will ensure that he get the good possible reply 
 will minister consider exercise the community electricity right within the infrastructure act to require commercial renewable energy developer to offer community the opportunity to part own scheme develop in their area 
 my hon friend raise an important matter as an energy nerd i be really interested in this power which despite my nerdery i do not actually know about we be actively look at this really important power which be put in place by the previous government 
 in response to a write question to i last week the minister confirm that no nationally significant infrastructure project have be consent to that will use great than good and most versatile agricultural land in my constituency the east park energy solar farm be close to but the overarch national policy statement for energy state at paragraph 
 the secretary of state should ensure that applicant do not site their scheme on the good and most versatile agricultural land without justification 
 can the minister confirm whether nearly acre of good and most versatile land be too much good quality agricultural land to sacrifice 
 the hon gentleman will know that any nationally significant project go through a proper planning process and it would not be right for i to comment on that none the less i be sure that the decision maker will be look closely at the issue that he have raise 
 there be to be a much reduce testing process for oil at the import terminal at grangemouth be the secretary of state concern that if import oil do not pass these reduce test it can not be use lead to scotland suffer a fuel shortage 
 throughout the month that we have be in government we have be do everything we can to work with the operator of the grangemouth refinery of course we be disappoint by its closure we have carry out a number of piece of work on fuel security we be not concerned about that at this point but across the whole country we keep constantly it under review 
 although the leader of the opposition think that achieve net be impossible without bankrupt we investment in low carbon energy for community such as severn beach in my constituency could create valuable skilled job what step will the government take to ensure that the area around the river severn will get the investment that it need to realise its potential 
 the hon lady be absolutely right on that the opposition be off to the wacky races when it come to net we in the labour party know the truth net be the economic opportunity of the century and under this government we will seize it 
 carbon capture utilisation and storage be the central plank of the humber vision do the secretary of state have any plan to meet the humber energy board and if he do not will he join i in do so 
 i talk every day to my hon friend about her constituency and i be very happy to meet whoever she want i to because we think this be an incredibly important matter the opportunity for her area and the humber be great if we can harness the talent of the people in her constituency 
 require developer to include solar panel in all new home and building would be extremely popular with the public and help deliver net target can the secretary of state give an update on his discussion with the secretary    of state for housing communities and local government include those on mandatory solar as part of the future home and building standard 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point we be actively work on that in government whatever ’s view on ground mount solar we in the labour party think that it have a role we do need solar panel on rooftop it be an important opportunity while we be about it perhaps the hon gentleman can start support our plan on planning and infrastructure so that we can build the clean energy infrastructure that we need 
 the secretary of state will be aware of the ongoing work to deliver new nuclear investment in hartlepool billion of pound be on the table which will mean job and skill for generation to come will he meet i to discuss how we can get this deal over the line 
 new nuclear be an essential part of our future energy plan my ministers and i would be absolutely delighted to meet my hon friend to discuss those plan 
 i welcome the warm word from the secretary of state early about the acorn project how confident be he that the chancellor be listen 
 i speak as an old lag in these thing we have never have a prime minister and a chancellor so enthusiastic and commit to the net agenda and what it can do economically for our country the right hon gentleman should take heart from that 
 teesside be see thousand of job come on stream in carbon capture and storage but the conservatives new energy policy would put those job at risk will the secretary of state restate his commitment to this industry and will he work to establish a europe wide co2 market to bring investment and job to our region 
 my hon friend put it so well this be the economic opportunity of our time our investment in carbon capture and storage show what be possible today ’s desperate request for attention from the opposition be anti business anti job anti growth anti investment and the wrong choice for britain 
 before we continue proceeding i pay tribute to john paddy hemingway the last survive battle of britain pilot who die yesterday at the age of mr hemingway be a teenager when he join the raf during the world war at the age of he be a fighter pilot in the battle of britain a month air campaign in to protect the southern part of england and british shipping from large scale assault by the luftwaffe there be no doubt that the courage and overwhelming sense of duty of raf pilot such as mr hemingway help to end the world war and allow we the freedom that we enjoy today 
 this government be ambitious for our people and our country we believe that unleash the talent of the british people be the key to our future success but the social security system that we inherit from the conservatives be fail the very people that it be suppose to help and be hold our country back 
 the fact speak for themselves in people of working age be now claim a sickness or disability benefit almost young people be not in education employment or training in of all our young people some be out of work due to long term sickness and the number of people claim personal independence payment be set to double this decade from to with the growth in claim rise fast among young people and those with mental health condition claim be up to time high in part of the midland wales and the north where economic demand be weak these place be decimate in the 80 and 90 write off for year by successive tory governments and never give the chance that they deserve 
 the consequence of that failure be there for all to see million of people who could work be trap on benefit deny the income hope dignity and self respect that we know that good work bring taxpayer be pay million more for the cost of failure with spending on working age sickness and disability benefit up £ since the pandemic and set to rise by a further £ by the end of this parliament to £ a year it be not like this in most other comparable country where spend on these benefit since the pandemic be either stable or fall while ours continue to inexorably rise that be the legacy of year of tory failure 
 today we say no more since we be elect we have hit the ground run to get more people into good work through our plan for change we be invest an extra £ into the nhs to drive down waiting list and get people back to health and back to work 
 we be improve the quality of work and make work pay with our landmark employment right legislation and increase in the national living wage we be create more good job in every part of the country in clean energy and through our modern industrial strategy and we be introduce the big reform to employment support in a generation with our £ get britain working plan today our pathway to work green paper set out decisive action to fix the broken benefit system create a more proactive pro work system for those who can work and so protect those who can not work now and for the long term 
 as a constituency mp for year i know that there will always be people who can never work because of the severity of their disability or illness under this government the social security system will always be there for people in genuine need that be a principle we will never compromise on disabled people and people with health condition who can work however should have the same right choice and chance to work as everybody else that principle of equality be vital too because far from what conservative members would   have we believe many sick and disabled people want to work with the right help and support unlike the conservatives that be what we will deliver 
 our aim be to secure a decisive shift towards prevention and early intervention almost people be in work with a work limit health condition and around fall out of work every year we have to do far more to help people stay in work and get back to work quickly because their chance of return be time high in the year our plan to give statutory sick pay to of the lowest pay worker and provide more right to flexible working will help keep more people in work the workwell programme be trialle new approach such as gps refer people to employment adviser instead of sign they off sick our keep britain working review lead by former john lewis boss sir charlie mayfield will set out what government and employer can do together to create healthy more inclusive workplace we will therefore help more employer to offer opportunity for disabled people include through measure such as reasonable readjustment alongside our green paper consultation on reform access to work so it be fit for the future 
 today i can announce another step our green paper will consult on a major reform of contributory benefit merge contribution base jobseeker ’s allowance and employment support allowance into a new time limit unemployment insurance pay at a high rate without someone have to prove that they can not work in order to get it therefore if someone have pay into the system they will get strong income protection while we help they get back on track 
 our objective be to restore trust and fairness in the benefit system by fix the broken assessment process and tackle the perverse incentive that drive people into welfare dependency labour members have long argue that the work capability assessment be not fit for purpose go through the wca be complex time consume and often stressful for claimant especially if they also have to go through the pip assessment more fundamentally it be base on a binary can or cannot work divide when we know that the truth be that many people ’s physical and mental health condition fluctuate the consultation on the conservatives discredit wca proposal be rule unlawful by the court i can therefore announce today that we will not go ahead with their proposal instead we will scrap the wca in 
 in future extra financial support for health condition in universal credit will be available solely through the pip assessment extra income be therefore base on the impact of someone ’s health condition or disability and not on their capacity to work reduce the number of assessment that people have to go through and provide a vital step towards deriske work and we will do more by legislate for a right to try guarantee that work in and of itself will never lead to a benefit reassessment and give people the confidence to take the plunge and try work without the fear that that will put their benefit at risk 
 we will also tackle the perverse financial incentive that the tories create which actively encourage people into welfare dependency they run down the value of the universal credit standard allowance as a result the health top up be now worth double the standard allowance at more than £ a month in they take away extra financial help for the group of people who could   prepare for work so we be leave with a binary assessment of whether people can or can not work and there be a clear financial incentive for someone to define themselves as incapable of work a factor the office for budget responsibility the institute for fiscal studies and other say be likely to be drive people on to incapacity benefit today we tackle this problem head on 
 we will legislate to rebalance the payment in universal credit from april next year fix the value of the health top up in cash term for exist claimant and reduce it for new claimant with an additional premium for people with severe lifelong condition that mean they will never work to give they the financial security they deserve alongside that we will bring in a permanent above inflation rise to the standard allowance in universal credit for the time ever this mean a £ annual increase in cash term by and it be a decisive step to tackle the perverse incentive in the system 
 we will also fix the fail system of reassessment the conservatives fail to switch reassessment back on after the pandemic so they be now down by more than third and face to face assessment have go from in to only in we will turn these reassessment back on at scale shift the focus back to do more face to face and ensure that they be record as standard to give confidence to claimant and taxpayer that they be be do properly 
 i can also announce that for people on universal credit with the most severe disability and health condition that will never improve we want to ensure that they be never reassess in order to give they the confidence and dignity they deserve we will also fundamentally overhaul the department for work and pension safeguard approach to make sure that all our process and training be of the high quality so that we protect and support the most vulnerable people 
 alongside these change we will also reform disability benefit so that they focus support on those in great need and ensure that the social security system last for the long term into the future social and demographic change mean that more people be now live with a disability but the increase in disability benefit be double the rate of increase prevalence of working age disability in the country claim among young people be up claim for mental health condition be up and claim for learn difficulty be up by over accord to the ifs every day there be more than new pip award that be the equivalent of add a population the size of leicester every single year 
 that be not sustainable in the long term above all for the people who depend on that support but the tories have no proper plan to deal with it just yet more ill think through consultation so today i can announce that this government will not bring in the tory proposal for voucher because disabled people should have choice and control over their life we will not mean test pip because disabled people deserve extra support whatever their income and i can confirm that we will not freeze pip either instead our reform will focus support on those with the great need we will legislate for a change in pip so that people will need to score a minimum of point in at least activity to qualify for the daily live element of pip from november that will not affect the mobility component of pip and relate only to the daily live element 
 alongside that we will launch a review of the pip assessment lead by my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability in close consultation with disabled people the organisation that represent they and other expert so that we can ensure that pip and the assessment process be fit for purpose now and into the future this significant reform package be expect to save over £ in the obr will set out its final assessment of the costing next week 
 our and final objective be to deliver personalised support to sick and disabled people who can work so that they can get the job they need and deserve we know from the last labour government ’s new deal for disabled people young people and the long term unemployed the difference that proper employment support can make more recent evidence from the work choice programme and additional work coach time show that support can make a significant difference in the number of people get and keep work and improve their mental health and wellbeing 
 this labour government believe that an active state can transform people ’s life we know that because we have do it before today i can announce that we will invest an additional £ a year in employment support with the aim of guarantee high quality tailored and personalise support to help people on a pathway to work the large ever investment in opportunity to work for sick and disabled people alongside that for those on the uc health top up we will bring in an expectation to engage and a new support conversation to talk about people ’s goal and aspiration combine with an offer of personalised health skill and employment support 
 we will go far because be out of work or training be so damaging for young people ’s future prospect in addition to fund our youth guarantee through the £ get britain working plan we will consult on delay access to the health top up in universal credit until someone be age reinveste the saving into work support and training opportunity so that every young person be earn or learn and on a pathway to success 
 the conservatives leave a broken benefit system that be fail the people who depend on it and our country as a whole the status quo be unacceptable but it be not inevitable we be elect on a mandate for change to end the sticking plaster approach and tackle the root cause of problem in this country which have be ignore for too long we believe in the value and potential of every single person we all have something positive to contribute and can make a difference whether that be in pay work in our family or in our community alongside our neighbour and friend we will unleash potential in every corner of the land because we be as ambitious for the british people as they be for themselves today we take decisive action and i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement she and i agree on thing the welfare bill   be too high leave unchecked it will rise to £ by the end of the decade spend more on sickness benefit than we do on defence be not the sign of a strong country 
 this be not just a question of money we have people of working age who be not in work due to ill health not fill the role business need not contribute to our economy and not fulfil their own potential the good way to get the welfare bill down be to get people off benefit and into work that be what we do year after year after take office in despite the once in a century pandemic more people be in employment when we leave office than when we inherit labour ’s mess before the pandemic economic inactivity be at an historic low but it be true that we then start to see a new phenomenon grow number of people and particularly worryingly young people claim sickness benefit a system set up with good intention to protect the most vulnerable in society have over time morph into something broad drive in part by a well intentione but not always helpful medicalisation of life ’s up and down 
 in government we identify the problem and work up plan to tackle it but at every point labour members oppose they in fact the now chancellor say that not single penny could be save from benefit when they come into office not only do they cancel or delay pretty much everything we hand over but they have no plan of their own they walk into the department with empty notebook all they have do in opposition be oppose instead of the hard work of come up with their own answer that be why the country have have to wait another month for this announcement in that time taxpayer have shell out £ in extra sickness benefit and nearly half a people have be sign off sick in fact people be sign on to sickness benefit while the secretary of state be talk 
 none the less i have be look forward to hear what the right hon lady would announce today and which of the many thing brief to the medium her spin policy wheel would eventually land on govern be hard we know that in the last few week the government have make it look really hard but that be nothing compare with how hard life can be for a severely disabled person somebody for whom get up get dressed and get breakfast thing most of we find easy this morning be hard if not impossible for some people the last few week have be deeply frightening they will be glad of the uncertainty finally end 
 i genuinely want the right hon lady to succeed and i welcome her commitment today to increase the number of reassessment and to have more of they face to face and record i welcome the investment in employment support for disabled people i welcome of course her reannounce a host of thing that we be do in government scrap the work capability assessment and create a single assessment be already government policy that be due to come in in her big idea seem to be to delay that until merge new style jobseeker ’s allowance and employment and support allowance into a new time limit high rate be a proposal that we work up in government we launch a consultation on tighten up eligibility for pip and by the way we would have go much far   with that we consult on end reassessment for people whose health condition will not improve and the right to try guarantee sound remarkably similar to our chance to work guarantee of course on the secretary of state ’s continue support for workwell i launch that programme with the now shadow chancellor my right hon friend   the member for central devon mel stride in fact the only original idea i can see in the entire announcement be increase the rate of unemployment benefit a labour policy if ever i have hear 
 this be a now or never chance to seize the moment a now or never for million of people who will otherwise be sign off for what could end up be a lifetime on benefit but today ’s announcement leave i with more question than answer how many people will be help back into work and by when surely we have not be wait month for just another green paper where be the fit note reform crucial to stem the flow of people on to benefit where be the action on people be sign off sick for the everyday up and down of life why be the right hon lady planning to save only £ when the bill be forecast to rise to over £ do the saving she be announce today include the £ we have already agree with the obr for reform the work capability assessment if so she have make virtually no saving of her own what be the net saving give the additional expenditure plan 
 fundamentally this be too little too late the fact be that £ just do not cut it with a bill so big go up so fast she need to be tough she should be say no more hard work taxpayer fund the family next door not to work no free top of the range car for people who do not need they no more sickfluencer help people to claim money they do not need 
 before the right hon lady put on her angry voice and lean across the dispatch box to shout at i about year i gently say to she that everybody in this chamber and around the country know that we lose and labour win her job now be to govern and mine be to hold she to account our country need everybody who can work to do so that principle should be at the heart of our welfare system it be good for the taxpayer good for the economy and good for the individual and their family who benefit from security dignity and purpose that work bring and it mean that those who genuinely can not work get the support that they deserve 
 the fact be that few people work under labour that have happen every time labour have be in office and it be already happen now the government should have take their time in opposition to come   up with meaningful reform but they do not and the country be already pay the price 
 i personally like the hon lady a great deal but her entire response seem to be rail against her own party ’s failing and lament action that her party fail to take too little too late will indeed be the epitaph of the conservative party thing on which i agree with she that this be a now or never moment and i be proud that this government be take it we be take decisive action duck the challenge that have be ignore for too long 
 i be not interested in be tough this be about real people with real life and we must be careful in how we talk about it i be interested in take the right step    to change the system in order to transform people ’s life and crucially ensure that we have a social security system that last in of we will have a health condition in our lifetime and in be disable unless the country the welfare state the world of work and all our public service wake up to that fact the welfare state that the labour party create will not be there for future generation that be what we be determined to secure this be a substantial package of measure that will save around £ by we will have to wait until the obr come up with its final costing on all this at the spring statement 
 i leave hon member with this a decade ago former chancellor george osborne say 
 government let unemployed people get park on disability benefit and tell they ’d never work again why because people on disability benefit do not get count in unemployment figure that could embarrass politician 
 the labour party be not embarrassed about this situation we be ashamed of the state the tories leave the country in we will face up to our responsibility it be time that conservative members do the same 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 i thank my right hon friend for her statement i absolutely agree our social security system be not fit for purpose the measure particularly those to increase employment support by £ a year and to increase the standard allowance of universal credit which the opposition fail to do in government will be positively feel 
 i appreciate the difficult financial circumstance that we face despite the opposition ’s assertion that £ be not a huge figure this be the large cut in social security support since there be alternative and more compassionate way to balance the book rather than on the back of disabled people i absolutely and fundamentally believe that my right hon friend be on the right course but i implore my party to try to bed in our reform before we make the cut as other have ask 
 there be so much evidence of the adverse effect that the conservative party have through cut to support and restriction to eligibility criterion when it be in government include the death of vulnerable people that can not be repeat i would be grateful if my right hon friend publish as a matter of urgency the government ’s analysis of the impact particularly mental health impact and outline when we be expect to respond 
 i thank my hon friend for her response we will publish the equality and poverty impact analysis alongside the spring statement i know that she be a lifelong champion of sick and disabled people and she have rightly raise concern include through the select committee of vital issue such as safeguard i look forward to receive the select committee ’s report on that in order to learn from the evidence that it receive although this be a substantial package with those estimate saving spend on working age sickness and disability benefit will continue to rise over this parliament the last forecast be that they would continue to rise by £ as she say these be important issue and   we need to work to get this right to ensure that proper support be in place for people i genuinely look forward to work with the select committee to get all these proposal right 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for share her statement in advance that be extremely welcome 
 the liberal democrats want to see more people in work include those with disability sadly the significant blocker to those people get into work be the appalling state of the health and social care system leave behind by the tories to my mind in more way than we desperately need the new labour government to drive forward with reform to invest in and improve our health service 
 the devil be in the detail of these proposal i fear what we will find as we turn over rock over the next few day particularly for the most vulnerable the secretary of state have describe the system as break so how will she drive significant change through the measure i fear that this be just tinker around the edge when we need real culture change within the dwp and investment in our nhs that be absolutely essential 
 i agree with the hon gentleman that we need extra investment in the nhs and to overhaul the culture of the dwp and that be precisely what we be do we be invest an additional £ into the nhs an extra £ into the disabled facility grant to help disabled people to live independently and £ into social care which be such an important issue 
 we need a decisive cultural shift in the dwp that be why our get britain working plan include proposal to overhaul jobcentre we have also say today that we need to look fundamentally at our safeguarding approach our pathway to work programme be genuinely just that for some people get out of the house be an achievement for other it be maybe go along to a community group do voluntary action or get skill that be what we mean and we will work closely not only with the nhs and social care and my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care but with voluntary organisation which have such a vital role in help people on to a pathway to success 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s commitment to ensure that no be on the scrapheap when it come to work and that everyone get the support that they need i note that she be consult on delay access to the health top up in universal credit until the age of will she explain the rationale for that age and what saving do she expect to make if that consultation go forward 
 my hon friend raise a really important issue patience be not my great virtue but member will need to wait until the spring statement for the obr ’ full assessment of individual measure and the saving they make on delay access to the health top up for people under there will be a specific   exemption for those who be never able to work because their disability be so severe this be all about match it with our youth guarantee announce in the get britain working plan to make sure every young person be earn or learn if someone be not in education employment or training when they be young the impact can be lifelong and scar on their health job prospect and earning so we have to put that right 
 how precisely will these benefit cut be realise give this government ’s anti business budget which have see business close at the fast rate since labour be last in office of those still stand be plan to cut staff to cope with the increase in employer national insurance contribution where be the job we know labour be the party of the magic money tree be labour now the party of the magic job tree too 
 the only party that believe in magic money be the conservative party who write a cheque that they could not pay unlike conservative members we believe that good work and right at work be of benefit to business because the good business know that they help retain people and reduce the cost of recruitment we be overhaul our approach in the dwp to employer because only in ever use a jobcentre to recruit we want to have a single account manager for all business we be go to make sure our jobcentre be much more embed in their local community so that they have detailed knowledge of individual employer that be the way that we get britain work and grow again 
 when the government make the decision to go down this route do they understand the pain and difficulty that it will cause million of our constituent who be use food bank and social supermarket these people be on the brink this £ cut be go to impact they more than her department give credence to i would like to be able to look my constituent in the eye and tell they that this be go to work for they as thing stand my constituent my friend and my family be very angry about this and they do not think this be the kind of action that a labour government take 
 i have great respect for my hon friend but let i say this to he i have spend year chair feeding leicester the programme to end hunger in my city and i know that i can look my constituent in the eye and say to they i know that get more people into well pay job be the key to their future success and i know that deal with their mental health problem which be so prevalent be essential if someone can work we will give they the help to get back on their foot because that be the long term route to tackle poverty and tackle inequality which be what this labour party be all about 
 like the secretary of state i be elect in and i need to tell she that our recollection differ when i come into this role after year of labour government of young people in the gosport constituency be not in education employment or training that number be down to last year since labour have take office   more people across this country of working age be now unemployed business in the sector that take on so many young people across our constituency from adult social care to childcare to hair and beauty be tell i that they be not take on more staff as a result of her chancellor ’s change to national insurance contribution surely the be mutually incompatible
