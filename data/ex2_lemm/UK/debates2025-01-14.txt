 at easter last year i have the opportunity to meet amanda damari in israel and to speak to some of the family of the hostage who be kidnap by hamas on that terrible and unfortunately memorable day   october the family have have a yo yo of emotion will the hostage be free or will they not be free now all of a sudden   there be a possibility after the rollercoaster of emotion that the family have be on over the last year and a half how can we ensure that they get the direct help that they need from our government

 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of iran ’s attack on israel on regional stability 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help counter potential threat to global stability by iran 
 we unequivocally condemn iran ’s attack on israel in april and october these attack and iran ’s ongoing support for its proxy and partner have destabilise the region and fuelled escalation alongside our ally and partner we will continue to hold iran to account for this behaviour include through sanction address iranian weapon proliferation and maintain our permanent defence presence in the region 
 i thank the minister for that answer clearly we all hope that there will be a deal to release the hostage hold illegally in gaza give that hamas hezbollah and the houthis the proxy of iran be on the brink of defeat the risk to the region now be that iran take direct action as we want to see the end of the despotic regime that brutalise the people of iran now be the time for sanction and the proscription of the islamic revolutionary guard corps once and for all will the minister take the necessary action to bring that regime to its knee so that democracy can be restore to iran 
 i recognise that the hon member have ask question about proscribe the irgc a number of time in this chamber and i can assure he that we be work urgently on measure to take the necessary action to deter the iranian state from pose a threat to this country and the region we will continue to update the house in due course 
 with the re election of president trump in the us we be likely to see a return to his policy of maximum pressure to prevent iran from develop a nuclear weapon what be the secretary of state ’s view on that approach will the government support our ally in the united states of america 
 we continue to work closely with the american administration and we look forward to do so with the new administration it be regrettably true that iran ’s nuclear programme have never be more advanced and it threaten international peace and security we remain determined that iran must never develop a nuclear weapon and we remain committed to a diplomatic solution to achieve that 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 the scale of humanitarian suffering in gaza be catastrophic and unacceptable the uk condemn israel ’s restriction on aid in the strong term this be a man make crisis and israel must act immediately to address it 
 the aid agency i have speak to be particularly concerned about access to medical facility and critical shortage of medical supply in gaza particularly northern gaza in the light of that what step be the government take to get additional medical supply to gaza for both palestinians and israeli hostage in desperate humanitarian situation 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this incredibly important issue in december i see for myself in jordan how medical aid have be block from enter gaza as i have say before the    position that the uk government have articulate at every possible juncture be that restriction on lifesave aid must end the uk continue to provide core healthcare relief item and have provide wound care kit item of medicine and critical funding for uk med to run its field hospital in gaza 
 i thank the minister for her response and i welcome the foreign secretary ’s effort to secure a sustainable ceasefire and the release of hostage 
 many of my constituent have express concern about the recent raid of kamal adwan hospital which be of the last healthcare facility still operate in gaza the hospital ’s director dr safiya be detain along with several of his staff during that raid international law prohibit the detention of medical staff in conflict zone what be the minister do to secure the release of these medical staff so that gaza ’s civilian can continue to access essential medical care 
 my hon friend be right to raise this critically important issue we have raise the protection of healthcare facility and the detention of healthcare worker directly with the israeli government the minister for the middle east my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer have specifically raise the detention of dr hussam abu safiya with both israel ’s deputy foreign minister and its ambassador to the uk 
 the ceasefire that be apparently be progress be seemingly the same as the draft in may which be deliberately frustrate by member of the israeli government sadly since that time hostage and those falsely imprison have remain captive and so many life have be lose no doubt the minister can assure the public that should the ceasefire be confirm every effort will be make to get aid and supply to the palestinians particularly those in northern gaza do she agree that this mean that neither israeli military activity nor israeli legislation prevent the work of the united nations relief and works agency can be accept 
 there absolutely must be a surge of aid into gaza that will be critical after a ceasefire however impediment to aid that remain must also be remove 
 the issue of unrwa have be previously discuss in the house the uk government ’s position be that unrwa must be able to continue to operate it be the only organisation with the scale and depth necessary to get that lifesave aid to people who need it 
 uav engines ltd base in staffordshire manufacture the engine power the hermes drone which be manufacture by elbit systems in the uk and use by the israeli military in the gaza strip israel regard the hermes as a critical asset provide strike capability will the minister confirm whether those drone engine or any other part for the hermes drone be still be supply to israel from the uk 
 the uk have the most robust arm control regime in any global comparison this government be determined to ensure that we fulfil our legal   responsibility and that we assess fully and legally arm exportation licence i can confirm to the house that since   september   there have be no extant uk export licence for item to israel that we assess be for use in military operation in gaza 
 last week hamas fire rocket at the erez crossing demonstrate once again the terror group ’s intention to disrupt aid delivery and prolong the suffering of gazans as well as israelis what assistance have the uk government offer to support repair that crossing and support israel as it get much need aid into gaza 
 we remain directly in contact with israel with un agency and with other partner in the region that be obviously at ministerial level and also with our special representative for humanitarian issue in the occupied palestinian territories the issue of crossing and their openness and safety have be raise repeatedly by the special representative and by member of this government that also cover attack by the terrorist hamas on those crossing 
 while gaza stand on the verge of absolute annihilation the israeli ambassador to the uk have repeatedly express opposition to a state solution emphasise that that be not a feasible solution give that the uk have consistently express support for a state solution but do not yet recognise of the state will the minister clarify any discussion she have have with the israeli ambassador 
 order this question be about humanitarian aid but i be sure the minister will be able to answer 
 the uk government ’s position be indeed that there must be a state solution the new government have be determine to do all we can towards that end that will include advocate for that solution at every juncture include with embassy and as would be expect with the israeli embassy 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the war in gaza on uk support for israel 
 the uk remain committed to support israel ’s security and wide regional stability in the face of threat from malign actor such as iran we be clear that israel must act in accordance with international humanitarian law and do more to protect civilian hospital and those who be in desperate need of their service 
 notwithstanding the hope that we all have of a ceasefire atrocity continue to take place daily in gaza with the killing of child the bombing of hospital and the threat of ban aid at the end of the month will the secretary of state explain exactly what the israeli government have to do to persuade the uk government to impose sanction ban all arm sale and recognise the state of palestine 
 since come into office we have take significant action call of course for a ceasefire we have be call for a ceasefire since december suspend relevant arm sale as have be set out by my right hon friend the minister for development and increase the amount of aid to the occupied palestinian territories we be also in steadfast support of unrwa 
 israel remain an important ally we have an important trading relationship worth £ last year and involve british job i be sorry any discussion of sanction be just not correct 
 i invite the foreign secretary to welcome the appointment of nawaf salam and to comment on its implication for our relationship with lebanon and israel and for iran ’s influence in the region what do he intend to do to ensure that that positive step improve our relationship with israel lebanon and the country in the eastern mediterranean 
 i be very grateful for this opportunity to speak about lebanon the development in lebanon over the past few day could transform the region the appointment of a new president and a new prime minister could provide lebanon with the opportunity to see hezbollah ’s capability diminish which the whole international community should grab hold of as the right hon member know from his time in office the uk contribution to the lebanese armed force be important and that the lebanese treasure we intend to continue with that and to go far over the come month which i know he will welcome

 the foreign secretary have rightly impose widespread sanction on russia for its war crime early he respond on the subject of sanction on israel by refer to the fact that talk of war crime be incorrect because of the value of trade and israel ’s historic status as an ally surely a war crime be a war crime whoever commit it all life be equal and international law be international law i invite the foreign secretary to explain to the house the difference of approach between war crime commit by russia and war crime commit by israel 
 we be on the brink we hope of a ceasefire deal it be important to be in israel yesterday and i remind the hon gentleman that this be of the tough region in the world i remind he of the malign effect of iran just next door hezbollah have be diminish but they be still there hamas have be diminish but they be still there i have to say that it be not right to comment on sanction and proscription but we be talk about an ally

 we have million shoehorn into a confine prison hundred of community destroy thousand of people indiscriminately kill and lifesave humanitarian aid be block will the foreign secretary show consistency judge israel on its action and at last define what netanyahu ’s apartheid regime be do to palestinians as a genocide 
 we have set out our position on the designation of genocide so i will not enter into that discussion again but i will respond to my hon friend on the question of aid access on which a ministerial colleague have speak already and on which we have be consistent we be clear that not enough aid be get into gaza and we have be clear with the israeli government on our difference on the conduct of hostility and of aid access 
 do the government deny that incoming president trump be deeply hostile to the propose chagos islands giveaway 
 the right hon gentleman will understand that we have support across the united states administration include from the pentagon the state department the agency and the white house we be confident that as the detail of the deal be provide in the proper way administration at a   time as he well know the new administration will recognise that this important deal protect our security and that of the united states as well as the unimpeded operation of the base on diego garcia which have be our primary objective throughout this process 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make a statement on the national security risk of drone be use to deliver weapon to high security prison 
 this be not a new issue effective prison security be fundamental to the rehabilitative nature of prison and ensure public confidence in the criminal justice system the availability of illicit item in our jail include drug and mobile phone undermine prison officer ability to do their job drone sighting around prison in england and wales be a matter of great concern and pose a major threat to prison security 
 the government inherit a prison system in crisis with violence and drug use on the rise we be work hard to deter detect and disrupt the use of drone it be not possible to talk in detail of the tactic we use to disrupt drone give the obvious security implication what i can say be that his majesty ’s prison and probation service invest in target countermeasure such as improvement to window netting and grille to stop drone from successfully deliver cargo such as drug and weapon in january restrict fly zone be introduce around all closed prison and young offender institution support police and prison staff to disrupt illegal drone use 
 ultimately it be crucial that we tackle demand almost half of people enter prison have a drug problem so we must get they into the right treatment to tackle the drug misuse that be so often a driver of their reoffending contraband supply and the illicit economy drive violence self harm and instability and prevent offender from engage in rehabilitative activity we be work to crack down on the level of violence and drug in our prison 
 the illicit economy be unfortunately highly profitable with price for drug and other commodity between and time their street value an a4 sheet of paper lace with drug can be worth £ so we must tackle the organise crime gang behind it that be why we have invest in a dedicated serious and organised crime unit who will work with law enforcement agency to disrupt these sophisticated criminal network we will continue to take a multifaceted approach to drone and the disruption that they cause to our prison system 
 give that this be a question of national security i find it astonish that the lord chancellor can not be bother to turn up to the house today yesterday—[interruption 
 order we do not need any more of that 
 thank you mr speaker 
 yesterday the chief inspector of prison warn that the police and prison service have cede the airspace above high security prison to organise crime group the result be that organise crime gang can deliver drug phone and weapon such as zombie knife to inmate with impunity due to the absence of basic security measure such as functional cctv protective   netting and window repair across visit in september and october he describe a damn picture of thrive illicit economy that jeopardise the safety of dedicated prison staff 
 in hmp manchester almost in prisoner have test positive in mandatory drug test and in hmp long lartin the figure be nearly in those prison hold some of the most dangerous man in our country include murderer and terrorist if organised crime gang can deliver phone and drug to inmate cell they could be deliver serious weapon and explosive as well 
 the chief inspector say that the potential for escape or hostage taking be of enormous concern this could not be more serious the situation have become in his word 
 a threat to national security 
 i do not pretend that these problem be entirely new but they have deteriorate and they need urgent action will the minister provide the timeframe for fix the most basic security measure what visit have the lord chancellor make to hmp manchester and hmp long lartin if she have not visit when do she intend to go little else could be more pressing what discussion have she hold with the prison governor will the minister assure the house that the government have confidence in the senior management to restore order do he agree with the chief inspector that the failure to grip the situation be a serious indictment of the department 
 who have year to grip this situation at least this government be take action—[interruption 
 order 
 this government be take action in the month the right hon member will know that drone sighting around prison increase by over between and on his government ’s watch much like everything in our prison his government have leave it to we to fix the broken system and clean up their mess it be a bit rich for he to come here and lecture we when he have year to put this right 
 we be instal new cctv system netting and other countermeasure to combat drone we have clamp down on the contraband that fuel violence behind bar we be tackle drone through a cross government approach as well as learn from our international counterpart to support our effort we be work with our eyes partner they face the same issue across their prison estate because this be not a uk problem but a global problem along with the home office and the ministry of defence we have x ray body scanner in prison provide full coverage of the closed adult male estate to prevent the internal smuggling of illicit contraband we be take action while the opposition just spout 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the minister will no doubt be pleased that the justice committee have just announce an inquiry into drug in prison with an emphasis on the use of drone by   organise crime gang to supply inmate what make it easy for drone to access prison be the appalling state of prison maintenance there be a £ backlog which do not accrue in the past month the shadow secretary of state ’s surprise be in itself surprising what be the timetable for repair the problem in prison and get to grip with that maintenance backlog 
 my hon friend be completely right that the prison maintenance programme that we inherit be in a state that be why the chancellor announce in the budget a £ boost to the prison maintenance budget over the next couple of year that be important he be right also to say that we need to grip this which be why the prisons minister in the other place have visit manchester and be regularly update on the situation there 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the word that be miss from the shadow justice secretary ’s question just now be sorry a national audit office report say of the then conservative treasury ’s investment in prison maintenance and security that 
 capital budget allocation for prison have be well below the level need 
 who be a treasury minister at that time none other than the shadow justice secretary today ’s report be the late chapter in a catalogue of tory prison failure that scupper their mission to reduce reoffende and therefore let down victim of crime will the minister tell we about a new approach to well empower governor with the investment and the autonomy need to properly invest in prison maintenance and security what investment will he make in prison officer recruitment through programme such as unlocked graduates which be critical to help drive security in our prison 
 the hon member be right about the failure miss in the shadow minister ’s question he be also right to ask what the government be do to support prison officer and prison governor we be invest in that and we will announce a new programme for training and develop new governor very shortly 
 i thank the minister for his statement the conservatives be do another faux outrage as they be the one who cede the airspace after year of colossal failure in our justice system what lesson can we learn from that failure so that we tackle the problem of drug in prison which be a big driver of drone drop 
 the lesson be that we need to work with prison governor and the police and invest in action to deal with the problem that be exactly what we be do we be work with everybody in the system to sort this mess out 
 apart from the serious security concern that this activity raise it show that prison bring resource pressure for local police force in west suffolk where highpoint prison   be due to grow significantly in the year ahead the police have ask i to ask the minister to ensure they receive additional funding to reflect that pressure will he do so 
 the hon member be right that it be important that local police force work strongly with hm prison and probation service on this issue that be what be happen he will know that funding both locally and nationally be deal with in an appropriate way 
 the prison officers association have be say for the past year that the threat of drone destabilise our prison and pose a massive security risk let i draw the minister ’s attention to the anti drone system at hmp guernsey which very effectively prevent that threat can we expect this new system to be implement in all prison in england and wales 
 anything that work will be build upon that be part of it drone technology have be accelerate through the ukraine war we know that we need to work very hard to keep ahead of the felon on this 
 we all appreciate the destructive impact of drug in our prison in stone great wyrley and penkridge we have the large cluster of prison in the united kingdom with hmp featherstone hmp oakwood and brinsford young offender institution prison officer do an amazing job try to tackle this issue but what specific measure can the minister bring forward to support their work to try to ensure that prisoner ultimately get on to the path of rehabilitation and kick the habit of drug 
 the right hon member be right that prison officer do an outstanding job i want to take the opportunity to commend the work of prison officer up and down this country prison now have incentivise substance free living unit provide a supportive environment for prisoner who commit to live drug free with regular drug test and incentive that project appear to be work 
 there have be a long stand issue at wandsworth prison in my constituency which have multiple drone drop every single week give the lack of cctv no netting and high staff vacancy little can be do to combat they follow the announcement of a £ investment into the prison will the minister please ensure that all these issue be address and ameliorate 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to work hard to address these issue but if there be a simple solution the previous administration would have wave that magic wand and we would not be sit here today it be important that the ongoing work of prison governor support by hmpps across the country and by minister get to the bottom of this and sort thing out which be what we be try to do 
 livelink aerospace in my constituency be a surveillance company that have create a technology that be be use on royal navy ship in airport and on private yacht this technology could be crucial to maintain the no fly zone above prison which be introduce in january last year will the minister explore this technology will he come to my constituency to visit livelink aerospace and see what the technology can do 
 it be important that we take advantage of what intelligence be out there if the hon lady write to i i will be happy to follow that up appropriately with she and the business involve 
 do the minister agree that the conservative party leave our prison in crisis with drug and drone use rife will he outline the urgent step that his government be take to ensure that such colossal failure can never happen again 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we inherit a prison estate that be full the police and the court be in danger of not be able to lock people up that be an abrogation of duty by the conservative party we have roll up our sleeve and tackle that and we will tackle this problem as well 
 i thank the minister for a very positive recent meeting on an unrelated subject be the main problem here the detection of the incoming drone or the ability to impede the delivery once they have be detect 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for the positive meeting i have recently with he official and the local business the answer to his question be that both those thing be issue 
 on visit the prison in the sheppey prison cluster in my constituency it be clear to see how the prison estate have be degrade over the past year i have talk to prison officer who be my constituent as well as work in the constituency about the problem they face day in day out it take more than a few sign say no drone to stop those drone what be the minister do to listen to prison officer and the prison officers association and to support they in tackle this those officer face threat and pressure from organised crime will he meet i to discuss this far 
 i would be happy to meet my hon friend if he could drop i a note to remind i i will do that this week the prisons minister be meet official from the prison officers association whenever i visit prison as i do regularly i meet the prison officers association representative in that prison they be key partner in tackle the problem that we have inherit from the previous government 
 high security prison ensure that our national security be not compromise because they house some of the most dangerous threat to our society in government the conservatives introduce legislation to make it an automatic   offence to fly drone within metre of any closed prison what assurance can the minister give this house that those who commit such offence will feel the full force of the law 
 that important action take by the previous government be quite correctly support by labour in opposition when anybody be find guilty of fly a detect drone the appropriate prosecution will follow 
 the welsh affairs committee recently visit parc prison in wales where we see the type of contraband be smuggle into prison by drone of the big problem report to we be multiple drone come in at the same time it be difficult for the security team to then bring they down even though they be use cctv what be the minister do to outlaw the use of those drone to keep our prisoner safe and secure 
 the security and safety of prisoner and prison officer be very important the prisons minister and the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones sit to my right recently visit parc prison and be well aware of the issue they be work with the prison authority to address they 
 month ago in the house i raise concern that hmp garth have be liken to an airport because of the number of drone illegally fly drug into the prison in response the lord chancellor tell i that the prisons minister be meet the governor and thinking 
 about how to deal with those problems”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 what precise action have the department take since then and what action will the minister take today to deal with the problem at hmp manchester 
 action be be take and thing be be do i have mention the issue around window and netting and bar but frankly this be a security issue we be up against organised crime we will not talk publicly about the measure that we be consider because that would not be the good way of tackle the issue 
 i recognise that this issue be very much related to drug have previously work for a homeless charity i have see the huge amount of damage that drug can cause to people ’s life and to their family what be the government do about the wide issue of drug supply both in and out of prison 
 as i have already say it be very important that we tackle drug dependency in prison the fact that we now have a little bit more space in prison allow more work to go on there to tackle drug dependency we know that education and employment also help to reduce reoffending which be why we have commit to improve prisoner access to not only drug support programme but purposeful activity and employment 
 the government have say time and again that they want to smash the criminal gang that illegally smuggle illegal migrant into the uk yet the government can not even smash the gang that smuggle drug and phone into our prison how can my resident trust the government to smash these gang 
 the resident of broxbourne will be well aware that for year the government that the hon gentleman support fail to tackle this problem this government be roll up our sleeve and get on with it 
 this be a long stand problem and the previous government do not do anywhere near enough to deal with it what they do do when former prime minister liz truss be lord chancellor be arrange for more dog to bark at drone around prison which they assure we would work have the ministry of justice do an assessment on how effective that policy be 
 i think everybody agree that that policy be bark 
 i thank the minister for his answer today and for his clear commitment to make change that will make a difference in northern ireland prison contraband have be a difficult issue to get on top of give the news today that drone be be so successfully use in the uk there be obvious cause for concern that their use may become more prevalent how will the minister ensure that the step take apply equally across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and that any additional funding that be require will be allocate 
 any lesson learn need to be apply across the united kingdom and that will happen we need to work with our eyes partner to ensure that the very good action be take northern ireland need to get the good of that as well 
 growth be the no mission of this labour government to grow the economy we need to help great british business to export around the world include to china the big economy in the world and our large trading partner not engage be simply not an option that be why i lead a delegation include the governor of the bank of england the chief executive of the financial conduct authority and representative of some of britain ’s large financial service firm include hsbc standard chartered and schroders to the uk china economic and financial dialogue the of its kind since 
 this dialogue have deliver a set of tangible benefit to ensure that british firm have great access to the chinese market while safeguard our national security the duty of any government in china i meet outstanding british company such as brompton jaguar land rover and astrazeneca that will benefit from the step that we have agree we have work to lift market access barrier across a range of good and service particularly in the agrifood sector on financial service we have successfully secure new licence and quota allocation for uk firm to improve operate access in china we agree to co operate far include by renew our share commitment to the uk china stock connect scheme launch in by deepen our co operation on wealth management through a uk china wealth connect scheme and by progress initiative on pension and sustainable finance deliver significant benefit for uk firm and the city of london i be pleased that china agree to issue its ever overseas sovereign green bond in london in underline the uk ’s position as a global capital for high quality sustainable finance 
 the uk be a global leader in financial service there be significant opportunity to expand our presence in new market and the tangible outcome we have deliver this week will help to deliver that these step be part of a wide programme to make substantive progress on improve arrangement for uk exporter and investor as reflect in new agreement on vaccine approval fertiliser whisky labelling legal service automotive and accountancy which have set we on course for this dialogue to unlock £ of value for the uk economy 
 these outcome agree with my counterpart vice premier he lifeng represent pragmatic co operation in action and support secure and resilient economic growth because security and economic growth go hand in hand that mean find the right way to build a stable and balanced relationship with china that be in our national interest that recognise the importance of co operation in address the global issue that we face of compete where our interest differ and of challenge robustly whenever that be require in beijing and shanghai i be clear that while we must co operate on area of mutual interest we will confidently challenge on area where we disagree i express our country ’s real economic and trade concern to the chinese include about trade imbalance and economic security and   i raise concern about russia ’s illegal war in ukraine human right and restriction on right and freedom in hong kong include the case of jimmy lai and the completely unjustified sanction against british parliamentarian 
 a key outcome of this dialogue be that we have secure china ’s commitment to improve exist channel so that we can openly discuss sensitive issue and the way in which they impact our economy because if we do not engage with china we can not raise our real concern this dialogue be just part of our engagement with trading partner across the world since become chancellor i have be to new york washington toronto and brussels to build our global economic relationship while my right hon friend the business secretary have travel to the gulf to boost trade and investment and my right hon friend the foreign secretary be engage with partner all over the world to deliver growth that benefit people across the united kingdom 
 we must continue to go far fast in drive economic growth to make work people well off that be why the prime minister launch our artificial intelligence opportunity action plan yesterday it throw the full weight of government behind ai in the uk to revolutionise our public service and make our economy more productive it be why next week i will talk to business leader investor and entrepreneur at the world economic forum meeting in davos to make the case that the uk be of the good place in the world in which to invest in the come week i will set out further detail of our plan to kick start growth in the economy after year of failure from the conservative party 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer 
 it be good to see the chancellor in her place and i thank she for advance sight of her statement i know that she have be away so let i update she on the mess that she leave behind the pound have hit a month low government borrowing cost be at a year high growth have be kill stone dead inflation be rise impact million interest rate be stay higher for long and business confidence have fall through the floor the labour party talk down the economy and crippled business with colossal taxis break all their promise this be a crisis make in downing street 
 it should hardly surprise the chancellor that international market be uneasy the uk ’s long term borrowing cost have rise to their high in almost year but while the government be lose control of the economy where be the chancellor her trip to china have not even begin when my urgent question be take in the house last week she be still in the country but she send the chief secretary to the treasury rather than face up to her failure may i ask she why she choose not to respond herself 
 the chancellor of course duck the difficult question by jet off to beijing i believe that in labour circle they be call it the peking duck but whatever be on the menu in china be it really worth the unedifye sight of an increasingly desperate politician scamper halfway around the world with a begging bowl the   chancellor ’s deal pale in comparison to labour ’s black hole which open up in the public finance while the right hon lady be absent from her station 
 let i give the house a sense of scale the deal that the chancellor have announce amount to £ a year the rise in our borrowing cost due to her disastrous budget have add about £ to our annual spending on debt interest alone literally time what she say she have bring back from beijing that be money that can not now be spend on the public ’s priority that £ be enough to pay for nurse or to cover labour ’s pernicious winter fuel payment cut for and a half year and of course even before this late market reaction the budget mean spend ten of billion more on service our debt accord to the office for budget responsibility ’s forecast third of the money raise from the chancellor ’s job tax will be swallow up by additional debt interest forget those billion go towards well public service they be go on pay the price of labour ’s mismanagement 
 we on this side of the house know how this sorry story go we have see it all before socialist government who think that they can tax and spend their way to prosperity labour government who simply do not understand that if you tax the living daylight out of business you will get stagnation they do not understand because there be barely a shred of business experience on the government front bench may i ask the right hon lady which of her promise she will break if the obr judge in march that she be now in breach of her own fiscal rule will she cancel promise spending will she ramp up borrowing or will she raise taxis yet again 
 this whole sorry tale be nothing short of a shakespearean tragedy be play out before our eye this be the hamlet of our time labour promise the electorate much while pour the poison into their ear and the end you can feel the end the chancellor flailing estranged it seem from those close to she those about her fall the drum beat ever close to go or not to go that be now a question the prime minister will be damn if he do but he will surely be damn if he do not the british people deserve well 
 the shadow chancellor be simply not serious i be on the opposition side of the house for year and i think that after a statement usually ask some question 
 we hear a great deal from the right hon gentleman about what he would not do but we hear absolutely nothing about what he would do now we can see what happen when the leader of the opposition tell the shadow cabinet that it should not have any policy as far as i can tell the conservative party ’s economic strategy be to say that the uk should not engage with the large economy in the world or indeed with our near neighbour and our big trading partner in the european union the right hon gentleman ’s economic strategy be to support high spending but none of the right decision that be require to deliver sound public finance and his economic strategy be to ignore the mistake of the past with no apology to the british people for his part in liz truss ’s mini budget that crash the economy i appreciate that have say that i may now receive a cease and desist letter from her later 
 question that the shadow chancellor do ask be why do i go to china i go to secure tangible benefit for british business trade overseas the right hon gentleman say that it be not worth it let he say that to the representative of hsbc standard chartered prudential schroders and the london stock exchange who attend those meeting with i last week all of whom have speak of the difference that it will make 
 i have be under no illusion about the scale of challenge that we face after year of stagnant economic growth high debt and economic uncertainty and we have see global economic uncertainty play out in the last week but leadership be not about duck these challenge it be about rise to they the economic headwind we face be a reminder that we should indeed we must go far and fast in our plan to kick start economic growth which plunge under the last government by bring stability to the public finance after year of instability under the conservative party unlock investment that plummet under the previous government and push ahead with essential reform to our economy and public service that be my message to the house today because if we get it right the prize on offer to we to the british people be immense the opportunity to make work people well off by make britain well off that be the mandate this government have and that be what we will deliver 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s commitment to growth in this country and to encourage investment in the uk listen to the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for central devon mel stride we would think the country be go to hell in a handcart do my right hon friend agree that this be no time for panic that it be perfectly possible to manage any pressure on the budget through astute management of public spending and that we be a very long way from the approach take during the year of austerity under the conservative party 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for that question i set out this government ’s fiscal rule at the budget in october we will pay for day to day spending through tax receipt and we will get debt down as a share of the economy we remain committed to those fiscal rule and will meet they at all time 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the chancellor for advance sight of her statement 
 let we be blunt the budget have not work the chancellor say that the government ’s no mission be growth but to date there be no sign that the government be go to deliver it the national insurance contribution rise be self defeat it undermine growth it do not unleash it and it pile pressure on to struggle small business and high street nor do it raise anything like the sum of money for the nhs that the government initially suggest it would now we have this much laud visit to china which the government themselves say be only worth £ to the uk over the next   year that be equivalent to just and a half hour of nhs spending a year—27.5 hour over the year period all growth be welcome but this really be small beer 
 what be we to make of the chancellor ’s pledge to improve exist channel with china it be nothing short of warm word and mixed message the chancellor should not have go to china unless there be a commitment that jimmy lai be go to be release
