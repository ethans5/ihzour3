 the serjeant at arm need to investigate the delay in the lobby please 
 the house have divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 may i start by give thank to you mr speaker and colleague who be attend today and in particular the staff of the house of commons for their assistance i think it be fair to acknowledge that today ’s debate be slightly unexpected so i be particularly grateful for all the help that i have receive and that your team have provide over the past few day 
 it might be unexpected but this be nevertheless a very timely debate on scotland ’s particular need it also come the day after the election of scotland ’s new councillor i want to give a shout out to lynda holton who win the by election in glenrothes last night with i think the snp ’s high share of the vote ever in the area and labour ’s or low share of the vote ever i think that speak to the disappointment feel in recent time and to the notion that sometimes politician in this place do not adequately address the need of scotland or other part of the united kingdom 
 before i get to the substance of my speech i want to be clear about something give the nature of the bill i will concede that it be not for everyone it be a short bill and to be fair it be not for everybody but to repeat the point that member make in the reading debate on the assist die bill we can get into the detail later on i want to be clear all of we across the chamber can disagree on a wide range of area but i be up for work with colleague from across the house particularly scottish labour to amend the bill to find some common ground and to meet the commitment that scottish labour have already make which be pertinent and relate to this bill 
 i be glad that we have this valuable time we do not always get the time to debate area of particular interest to scotland it be ironic that i have be give time to debate something that relate to snp policy but also to labour policy and to a certain extent to liberal democrat policy it be unfortunate that the liberal democrats have be unable to attend today this issue have become particularly apparent give the catastrophe visit on our economy and our citizen as a direct consequence of leave the eu when i say that i know that i do not say anything that be particularly controversial 
 i remember with fondness my time work closely with the secretary of state for scotland when he be far sight enough to see the utter catastrophe that would be visit on scotland and the rest of the uk if we embrace a hard brexit i value the time work with he on that i have since be a bit surprised that he have subsequently embrace that hard tory brexit i know that thing change in politic we take the circumstance when they change but i be not entirely sure what have change for the positive since we leave the eu in the economy have tank right and opportunity have be take away from our citizen and we have lose billions—£40 a year to the exchequer those be not just my number on that point before i mention another labour figure i will give way to the hon lady 
 i thank the hon member for give way he be right to talk about grow the economy do he agree that if the scottish government have use the power they actually have to grow the scottish economy between and it would now be £ large and my constituent would be much well off 
 i be a great admirer of the hon lady she join i on the russia sanction list this week and i pay credit to she for her work for the child of ukraine but i be somewhat surprised that give those growth figure she have now turn out in favour of independence we all know what happen when scotland remain part of the uk and the hit that we take it be disappointing that labour have embrace that i will take a intervention before i make some progress 
 my hon friend raise an interesting point about the epiphany the secretary of state for scotland have have in the intervene decade about the merit and de merit of brexit be it not the case that no matter what this minister think or what any other minister think in any british government scottish or otherwise they be not in thrall to the reality of the economy they be in thrall to voter in middle england 
 as usual my hon friend make an excellent point 
 i want to come on to the way in which we discuss and debate migration migration be a good thing it benefit all of we all of we throughout time have benefit from migration i have be deeply disappoint by i be sorry to say mr speaker the poison that often seep into our rhetoric whenever we discuss this issue we need to be honest nobody be talk about uncontrolle migration and we need a migration policy i want to talk about some of the industry that have talk to i in a really sensible way that i think this house should listen to about how we deal with migration 
 i say to   the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter   that i would mention labour analysis by the labour mayor of london reckon that brexit which this government have embrace i do not know what happen to the secretary of state for scotland i consider he a colleague lose we £ a year so when the government be make cut to the winter fuel allowance and cut to the disabled that be all to go and pay for a brexit that nobody vote for and nobody want 
 while i be talk about people embrace a hard tory brexit i want to refer to a former member of this place michael gove even before the brexit vote the architect of brexit could see the damage that would be cause to scotland ’s economy what do the architect say 
 if in the course of the negotiation the scottish parliament want to play a role in decide how a visa system could work much as it work in other part of the european economic area then that be something we ’ll look into 
 he go on to say that 
 the number who would come in the future would be decide by the westminster parliament and the holyrood parliament work together 
 that be a commitment make by a conservative minister prior to the brexit referendum i remember listen to it on radio scotland 
 i be loath to quote michael gove frankly when the history be write of this place hence there can be few politician who along with former prime minister johnson will have cause as much damage his legacy will be of cost and damage economically as well as in term of opportunity for our young people but in that moment of self reflection mr gove do say that scotland need a particular solution i also think that i would quote he because i be go to appeal to scottish labour today and they appear to have embrace michael gove they be now get prepare to stick he in the house of lords to make he an unelected bureaucrat for life something he rail against the secretary of state be make face i be not sure if he have sign off on that yet or how keen he be on it but the government have hear what mr gove say about unelected bureaucrat be about to stick he in the lords i understand from the press and journal i believe everything that i read there that he be about to become lord gove of torry i be not sure what the good people of torry think of that or what they have do to deserve it my right hon friend   the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn   will have a well idea than i do but i be not sure they will think an awful lot of that have embrace a hard tory brexit scottish labour be now 
 will the hon member give way 
 oh here we go if you can tell i why on earth labour be put michael gove in the house of lords i will gladly give way 
 order can i remind the hon gentleman to do less you ing please 
 i thank the hon gentleman for indulge i a time he reference brexit can he clarify for the house why his party spend less on campaign against brexit than on a local by election campaign in scotland the newfound conversion to oppose brexit might be welcome but that clarification would be helpful 
 i be glad to respond to that i be deputy director of our remain campaign and i be delighted when not only do every part of scotland vote overwhelmingly to remain in the eu but every local authority area vote to remain in the eu even those that have vote against join the eu 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker could you give guidance on whether re run the brexit debate from year ago be in any way link to a single clause of this bill from the scottish national party 
 that be not a point of order the bill have a broad scope so it do allow for some broadness in the debate 
 i be not that surprised that the labour party want to close down a debate on brexit the hon member be seek to spare his party its   blush in particular scottish labour and i respect he for that we know why we need to open up that debate the treasury will tell we why it be because of how much money brexit be cost our public service our young people know why it be because of the opportunity brexit be cost they 
 i listen to   the hon member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin   yesterday in westminster hall he make a good speech in which he try to talk about opportunity for young people through a youth mobility scheme that he endorse but he also speak of cap the number of young people who could participate so that few young people have the freedom of movement that both he and i enjoy what a paucity of ambition from the labour party for our young people who have be leave with few right i expect that from the conservative party but not in my wildest dream would i have expect it from the labour party which now want to crow about the situation and the cap on young people 
 the westminster hall debate be interesting and be largely conduct in good spirit though i think his speech slightly misjudge the tone of westminster hall i and a number of labour parliamentarian have be look for practical step to move forward our relationship with the european union we have have year of move backwards under the conservatives and we have now hear a speech that seem to be detach from reality my job our job on the labour benches be to get a strong deal with the european union of the key step we think be a visa base youth mobility system and i be proud of that 
 i be glad the hon member be proud of the opportunity he will be deny young people by go ahead with labour ’s plan i find that debate yesterday slightly frustrating my hon friend will have sit through similar debate in which labour member after labour member in fairness there be a number of they they win the election after all talk about how dreadful brexit be and the damage it do to our young people university small and medium sized enterprise and security and to britain ’s place in the world but what be the government do about it nothing they be embrace the hard of hard brexit they could rejoin the custom union and reintroduce freedom to bring benefit to citizen the length and breadth of the uk 
 i sit on the opposition benches behind snp members during those long tumultuous day of the brexit debate and i remember watch snp member after snp member game the system to push we towards a no deal brexit in the hope that the government of the time would abandon the plan there be labour members who argue consistently that we should adopt plan and deal snp members vote against that at every opportunity because their narrow grievance politic be more important than a good deal for this country 
 the hon member be a bear again brexiteer and he have take on the nonsense of brexiteers he should have a look at the european union withdrawal no act pass by this house which ban a no deal brexit which he say he be push on who   be of the co author of that bill i be i work with labour colleague liberal democrat colleague green colleague and sdlp colleague to stop the damaging no deal that brexiteers embrace he have embrace it and boris johnson embrace it 
 let i move on to scottish labour we have hear quite enough nonsense from   the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell   today i be of the author of the bill that we call the benn burt act because of the fine work do by those member 
 order may i remind the hon gentleman that the bill be an immigration bill while i do say that the scope be quite wide will he please try to stick to immigration 
 you be quite right madam deputy speaker but i be keen to knock on the head some of the issue raise by the hon member for stoke on trent central let i talk about scottish labour ’s commitment i will quote the leader of the scottish labour party anas sarwar i do not always do this and i know that the secretary of state do not like talk about he he frequently disregard he but let i at least give anas sarwar his place he say 
 i ’ve have a number of conversation with yvette cooper and uk colleague in the run up to the election and since the election they already want to reform the migration advisory committee to make sure there be proper scottish representation they recognise there be different migration need in different part of the country 
 as for reach out a bit more to other colleague not everything in the bill be for everybody in this house but the bill give we an opportunity to meet commitment make we could do that on reading we could introduce amendment and have a bill team i would love to have really good strong scottish labour representation on that interruption i would also like to have conservative representation on it let the team be reflective of who be in the house i would be generous to the party of   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie almost as generous as the labour party regularly be to his party 
 let i quote scottish labour ’s deputy leader jackie baillie say 
 i would expect government to work together to talk to each other to respond to each other ’s need at the moment there be no plan for 
 this be say pre election 
 but i think if you have government take common sense approach that an incoming labour government would do then dialogue will continue 
 the secretary of state will have the opportunity to talk about this today and i very much look forward to an update on where he be on the talk the bill give precious time to he and to the office of other secretary of states and give the rest of we time to meet the need of the scottish sector 
 i be glad to see   the hon member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton   in his place i welcome he as he have rightly say when it come to immigration policy size do not fit all it should not be beyond we to devise way to attract more people to work and settle here he have talk effectively about the challenge for the rural and island community that he represent    and i be glad to hear his productive intervention on that i hope that he be able to have conversation with his hon friend about that 
 let i quote from the scottish labour manifesto 
 we will work with the scottish government when design workforce plan for different sector this will ensure our migration and skill policy work for every part of the uk 
 i be strike by the hon gentleman ’s interest in make sure that young people get the opportunity that they deserve because in east thanet far away from scotland we be deeply concerned that in young people be out of education employment or training i wonder what he have to say about the snp ’s record on this issue give that in young people be out of education employment or training in scotland 
 the hon lady make a good point how can we provide opportunity for young people she will also know that right now we be provide few opportunity for young people scotland be work very effectively on have positive destination include through the great work of skills development scotland that speak to the migration debate we have have in recent year migration have drive our policy and our economic growth for century yet labour be lean into the reform agenda it be very disappointing that reform member be not in their place which be so poisonous to our political rhetoric migration and refugee be entirely separate issue the hon lady will also be aware of the tragic small boat issue which we talk about at length although we do not talk about migration as a whole i want we to have a more sensible debate on migration 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will not take the hon lady ’s intervention just now i very much look forward to the contribution of   the hon member for east thanet ms billington i know kent well and i think there will be a valuable contribution to be make from that part of the united kingdom include on the impact that brexit i know that she talk about this issue have have on young people in her area 
 the liberal democrats have traditionally talk about great decentralisation of government that be a point that they stand on have a federal party i would have love to have take an intervention from a liberal democrat member today but of course they be not here alex cole hamilton the leader of the liberal democrats in scotland accept that immigration be essential for maintain growth but also for the sustainability of service i will talk about that in a moment he have also talk about how we need 
 both of scotland ’s government to work together 
 on migration 
 to ensure that rule be sensitive to the skill that be need in every corner of these island and in every sector of our economy ”—[scottish parliament official report   january c. 
 we can pick that up in committee if we can work together i note talk at the liberal democrat conference about a special visa for those flee donald trump   i be not sure what representation the liberal democrats have make to the government on that maybe the secretary of state can tell we but there be always opportunity to be have 
 i move on to a point of common ground i concede that we be not all on the same page there be difference on this issue but that be the whole point of parliament we come together to debate and see whether we can find solution sometimes the majoritarian nature of this place do not help i concede that labour and scottish labour win the election and i congratulate they and the prime minister on that we have see what have happen to their poll number since but they win the election however they do so base on a small percentage of vote unfortunately that be the system we have i ask labour members to not make the same mistake that the conservatives do particularly boris johnson ’s conservatives and to appreciate that or of the vote be not a majority it might give labour a majority of seat but the party need to listen to other party other bit of the country and all sector that be crucial 
 we can debate and discuss and i can quote bit from scottish labour manifesto from the snp from the scottish liberal democrats and yes even the conservatives but we all have a responsibility to try to listen to the sector that be do such valuable work we all try to do so in our different way include in our constituency which be important for example this week i go to east scryne farm in angus just outside carnoustie and speak to a local farmer about the value of migration to the berry industry i know other member will have do similar a number of we will have enjoy berry from angus over our breakfast this morning 
 and perthshire 
 we will also have enjoy berry from perthshire and even aberdeenshire all of that depend on migration i know that in order to improve their work here member will try whenever possible to engage with and listen to constituent i be not ask we all to come to the same conclusion but it be in that engagement that we all seek to do our work well 
 the hospitality and tourism industry be vital for rural and remote community for every sector in scotland and elsewhere in the uk leon thompson the executive director of ukhospitality scotland say 
 the hospitality and tourism industry across scotland have be call for a scotland visa for some time we believe it really be of the way in which we can help address the skill and workforce shortage that we have in the industry 
 the scottish tourism alliance say 
 failure to find a tailor solution risk have a further detrimental impact on the economy and opportunity for economic growth 
 as staff shortage be lead to tourism and hospitality business close for long outside the summer visit season reduce opening hour and shut down certain service such as food offer in hotel 
 regardless of our own thought we can see straightaway the impact that have on growth and the sustainability of our service the scottish tourism alliance also say 
 introduce a scottish specific visa scheme not only would match immigration to the demand for certain skill 
 as it have do for century 
 but also encourage more people come to live and work in scotland particularly in rural and island community that be experience a drain in people of work age and family 
 i thank the hon member for give way and for bring forward this debate which be interesting if nothing else how do the snp suggest we encourage people to live in scotland and particularly rural scotland give that anyone in scotland earn over £ pay more income tax local government have a £ odd shortfall which affect rural community more give how money be spend over a large area and scotland have a housing crisis how do those thing attract people 
 i will maybe leave aside some of the hon lady ’s sum i be not sure whether she have be read labour briefing but she do make a valuable point about rural area and i acknowledge her commitment to her constituency and her rural background i commend she for the way she conduct herself in this place there be a number of point here 
 we know that bring worker to rural area and the very high threshold to bring people into the country be a challenge that be not new which be why so many rural industry have be call out for a scottish visa system to plug that gap what be scottish government policy well we have talk with our labour colleague although not i would expect the conservative party for ideological reason about have a more progressive taxation system in which those who earn less pay less and those who earn more pay more i will not criticise   the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross who stand for election on a conservative manifesto and win but i be always surprised that the labour party do not take the opportunity to endorse such a system more strongly 
 some of the scottish government ’s budget still come in the form of a block grant from westminster that be a huge amount for all the talk we have hear of decentralisation empowerment and so on why do we not have a more sensible approach to that 
 the hon gentleman rightly mention the block grant if as he say not entirely correctly the block grant be the large part of the scottish budget why do he vote against the budget in which the block grant give the scottish government £ extra 
 what i find strike be that the scottish government have not only have to receive their block grant rather than make these decision for ourselves which those of we on the snp benches would like to do but have spend year with tory austerity and be star down the barrel of cut elsewhere the secretary of state might quote figure in term of the cash but after year and year of tory government that be not be help by the labour party by the cut that have come about as a result of brexit which they now endorse by the cut to the winter fuel allowance that labour bring in which the scottish government bring in measure to offset 
 the bedroom tax 
 and the bedroom tax interruption the secretary of state be chuntere from a sedentary position i have always want to say that in this place but in all these area the scottish government be offset the damage that westminster policy have cause for how long do we have to put up with damage westminster policy this bill be a way of offset some of the damage that have be do by a hostile environment and by brexit which i be astonish day and daily that the scottish labour party continue to endorse 
 let i talk about the scottish care system all of we will benefit from the care system at some point all of we and we will all have love one who benefit so the voice of that sector be particularly pertinent scottish care have say 
 the current uk immigration system be fail the social care sector in scotland the recent rule change particularly the ban on dependent 
 which have have a big impact on other sector as well 
 and the incompatible increase in the minimum salary threshold exacerbate exist recruitment challenge and pose significant risk to the sustainability and delivery of essential care service 
 i talk about bit of my constituency in angus and now let i talk about another bit the secretary of state and i have an exchange about this we know that the ban on dependant have also have a significant impact on the high education sector i be glad to see the convenor of the all party parliamentary university group   the hon member for erewash adam thompson in his place those of we with high education institution in our constituency i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests will know of the damage that have be do by the ban on bring dependant to this country 
 care be an issue that matter deeply to i but the problem with care be not that we be not get cheap labour from elsewhere it be that we be not pay care worker enough that be of the thing that a national care service would seek to solve why do the snp waste so much money—£28 on its fail national care service rather than work across the house in good faith to deliver the care that people need 
 order i remind all member that the bill be about why scotland should have devolve power over immigration 
 i be glad if we can get back to the bill i be strike that labour members never seem to be that keen to talk about the area for which they have responsibility they talk about the scottish government an awful lot but not the area for which they have responsibility this bill speak to a specific scottish solution that could be bring in to meet particular scottish need and it be that to be fair scottish labour have talk about 
 let i move on to talk about think tank and other organisation the law society of scotland 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will give way to the secretary of state more time and then i will move on to these other organisation 
 the hon gentleman have be very generous in give way when it suit he to do so all the thing he be talk about be not include in the bill it be a simple line bill that would devolve the entire immigration system to scotland for member who might not know how the scotland act operate let i explain that if a matter be contain in schedule to that act it be reserve and if it be not it be deem to be devolve this bill be just devolve the entire immigration system so the individual issue relate to visa that he be talk about be irrelevant to this debate 
 i thank the secretary of state because that be a valuable intervention and he raise a good point—[interruption i be glad that he be pay attention now i raise that point at the start of the debate when i say that this be not ideal it be a short bill that be propose some time ago and as i have say i be very open to it be amend i hope we will vote on this today and i ask the secretary of state to meet i so that he and i can sit down with his official and home office official if they will listen to he and bring they in i be look to the secretary of state and hope that he will today give that commitment to meet i so that we get something that work for his party can work for other and can hopefully work for the sector as well interruption i will take that as a yes so i be very glad and thank he for be so constructive 
 the hon gentleman have to be clear with the house about the purpose of the bill because we will have to vote on it today if the division bell re if the bill pass it will merely remove immigration from schedule of the scotland act which would devolve immigration to the scottish government yes or no 
 rise 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will answer the secretary of state ’s point and then give way the secretary of state have be here for long than i 
 i have be here long than the secretary of state 
 my hon friend say he have be here long than the secretary of state 
 the secretary of state know that this be a reading debate i have be keen to say that from the start i have be say it to the medium this morning and i say it in my letter to anas sarwar which i copy to the secretary of state i want to do that and to make sure that my letter go to scottish leader i be not sure how often they talk but i want to ensure that the secretary of state have see the letter as well the letter talk about we come together and talk to each other on that point i will give way to a very experienced member my hon friend   the member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for give way i know that most labour member be new to the procedure and working of this house but the secretary of state be not so he will know from experience that private member bill be practically rewrite in committee my hon friend be ask that we be allow to take the bill through to committee where this can be work out surely even the secretary of state who i believe have be in this house since understand how these thing work 
 order i remind the hon gentleman before i call   the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins   to continue that intervention should be on the member who be speak 
 thank you madam deputy speaker 
 now that we have clarify that point of reference i look forward to the vote today that the secretary of state be commit to and i look forward to meet he so that we can work together because that be the right thing to do and we will have to make concession of course we want to see the devolution of immigration we want to see independence we differ from other member in this chamber we accept that we have difference and that we be vote in on different manifesto but it be not beyond the wit of man to be fair this be something that the hon member for na h eileanan an iar have already reference to try and find a bit of common ground 
 now let i talk about some of the think tank and other organisation and what they have say because i be keen to let other member have the opportunity to speak 
 hear hear 
 that be the most effective heckle i have hear all day though that be not where i expect it to come from 
 the law society of scotland say 
 bespoke visa scheme for scotland combine with expand international outreach activity in relation to immigration to advertise these new arrangement would be an effective way of ensure that immigration policy meet scotland ’s need 
 prosper formerly the scdi say 
 scdi support great flexibility on immigration for scotland to respond to its distinct demographic and employment need other country 
 this be something my hon friend the member for perth and kinross shire have work on very hard 
 successfully operate regional migration scheme which target the specific need of their economy and scdi believe that there be workable option for more differentiation in the uk ’s system 
 i agree with that 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 no i want to continue with this 
 alison evison a former labour councillor and former president of cosla say 
 there be a strong unified voice across all sector in scotland in favour of a flexible immigration system that can meet our particular economic workforce and population need for many year   cosla have be call for an immigration system that can be responsive to local as well as national need and that recognise and address the challenge that we face 
 finally reform scotland have do a huge amount of work on this i commend its paper to all member of the house as we seek to inform ourselves when we go through to committee and however we work together to populate that it have say 
 there be no reason why westminster can not create an immigration system which take scotland ’s different situation into account it be important to remember that this have be do before through the fresh talent initiative 
 which in fairness lord mcconnell on the labour scottish executive work with the uk government to do 
 it would not be unique there be other decentralise approach elsewhere in the world i pay tribute to my hon friend the member for perth and kinross shire whose work on the scottish affairs committee along with other hon member be very effective the committee look into the matter and i know he will want to talk about that a decentralised approach have be take in canada australia belgium and elsewhere so it be not unique this be the government of devolution they talk about devolution as donald dewar tell we devolution be a process not a final destination this strike i as be the next process and it have happen elsewhere 
 finally i want to go into the different conversation about migration 
 rise 
 i see a number of member want to intervene i be glad to give way to my hon friend   the member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman   because she want to come in early and i do not take her intervention then 
 my hon friend be make an important case about scotland ’s unique need and the way that our democracy differ to go back to the economic point the found mission of this labour government be about grow the economy so will my hon friend explain the impact of increase migration what be the impact on the economy of bring more people in to do more job in the economy 
 i be not an economist but any economist would say that the impact of that be growth it be positive in the aftermath of leave the eu we see a surge in migration under boris johnson ’s government member have talk about that and criticise the conservative government as i have do however what strike i about that migration to date be that at the same time as we see a surge in migration to grow the economy i be not say anything against that we see a reduction in the right that we ourselves enjoy as uk citizen and a devaluation of the british passport i may no long wish to hold a british passport that might not be something that i want but its devaluation have impact each and every of we because of the loss of those right 
 before i finish i will take more point from   the hon member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna who i know have be try to intervene 
 i be very grateful to the hon member for give way i be interested to hear what he say about the various expert talk about regional migration policy unfortunately my constituency suffer from a regional migration policy in live memory as the isle of sheppey be separate from mainland migration during both war in the previous century that have leave a lasting impact of deep profound socioeconomic damage to sheppey because people could not get on or off the island and we could not get the worker we need that have leave a deep legacy of distrust between the island and the rest of great britain we do not want to replicate that across the whole of the united kingdom and that be why i oppose the bill 
 i know the isle of sheppey i know kent very well the kingdom of kent be a fine county the garden of england i know some of the challenge that the hon gentleman rightly raise he be represent his constituent very effectively in do so and i be grateful to he not just for raise the issue but the way in which he raise it kent be a fine place 
 on that point will the hon gentleman give way 
 i be try to answer the point raise by the hon member for sittingbourne and sheppey kent be not scotland and scotland be not an island we have some fine island as my hon friend   the member for argyll bute and south lochaber brendan o’hara   be keen to remind we on a regular basis but they be not the same to compare the isle of sheppey with scotland be a false comparison i take the hon gentleman ’s point and he be right to raise it the value of these kind of debate be that we can have such exchange the reason that i go through what have be say by all the think tank the expert and the sector i could have go on for long but i suspect you madam deputy speaker would have haul i up for that be because there be such a body of evidence in scotland around the issue that be why the idea have have such a serious reading from every single party in scotland 
 on that point do my hon friend agree that it be that strength of cross sector agreement in scotland that leave so many people disappoint their expectation and hope be raise that a change of government in this place would lead to a change in migration policy so do that not make it essential that scotland ’s interest in relation to this issue be serve by power rest in holyrood rather than the government here 
 my right hon friend be right i want to see these power rest in holyrood that will surprise nobody and he and i absolutely agree on that i have also open up this matter by say you can amend you can change i do not want my hon friend the member for perth and kinross shire to have to school the secretary of state again on process but that be something that we can do i say in the spirit of collegiality that i look forward to work with the secretary of state on this issue because i think we can find common ground 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will finish with a conversation on migration but i will take more intervention because i want to hear the perspective of another member from elsewhere in the uk 
 the hon member make the point that there be a body of evidence in favour of his bill i point he to another body of evidence the fact that there be child in scotland who do not have a home to call their own at the same time we have child in school in scotland with the wide poverty relate attainment gap ever that be the body of evidence that we need to look to do he agree that his party would be well off look at address those issue to attract worker to scotland rather than create more red tape for business 
 i have to say i be a bit strike by that when the government be bring in their cut to the disabled which will push more child in scotland into poverty that be a westminster policy drive scottish child poverty at the same time that we have un report talk about the benefit of the scottish child payment if that policy be bring in across the uk it would take ten of thousand of child include those in the hon lady ’s constituency out of poverty we know that that would happen i be glad that that be the final point because it talk to i of the paucity of ambition we have see from the labour party which i find disappointing and which will drive more child into poverty through cut to the disabled if it simply replicate what we do in scotland with the scottish child payment there could be benefit throughout the united kingdom 
 i look at the country around we that have take a more positive approach to european integration and to work with other country look at ireland and the benefit that it have have from independence and european integration where under previous government we see unfairness we now see that gap be reduce because of their wide range of power a country that previously suffer from emigration be now benefit from immigration that be ambition those be the benefit that these thing can bring and they be right on our doorstep 
 that point talk to i about the conversation around this issue can we please pull the poison out of the migration debate nobody be talk about uncontrolled migration and we obviously need to distinguish between migration and refugee maybe on the eve of his funeral we can reflect on pope francis ’s compassion for the most vulnerable in society we would all do well to reflect on that especially on the heartbreaking conversation i have have around those people desperate enough to get into small boat and try to cross the channel 
 i will talk about the scottish trades union congress member might do well to listen to it the minister be right to highlight both the negative effect of pander to anti immigrant sentiment and the need for a separate scottish approach the stuc support additional power on migration for the scottish parliament if government members will not listen to we to reform scotland the care sector or the high education sector maybe they will listen to the trades union congress instead 
 the minister be right to push back on the hard right and on how we conduct ourselves in office we must challenge reform and i be deeply disappointed that its member be not here today because i have be reasonably generous in take intervention from member of different party i wish they be here so that we could push back on the rhetoric that i be sorry to say too many in this house too often lean into 
 this idea be initially propose by michael gove to offset brexit that be the idea we get from he brexit leave we poor with few right and more isolated and it leave young people with few opportunity it hit public finance and our right and it leave the uk isolated and vulnerable more isolated than at any other time since the world war 
 i be an internationalist i want to see country pool and share sovereignty i want to see a european union that provide a model in the modern age a european union that—[interruption this be the thing that labour like the tories and reform lean into this sense of british exceptionalism they lean into the sense that this be the only union out there but that exceptionalism be so small in its outlook that be how i would describe it small isolated and lonely 
 i want to see we rejoin the european union ireland and england have never have a well relationship in their history than they do now our relationship be of partnership of equal and of previously be within the union that build that labour be elect on a small minority i say to labour member that it be time to listen this bill be imperfect i can see that it will not be for everybody but let we approve it in principle let we get it through and then let we work together on a commitment that have be make by our party and the scottish labour party i be deeply grateful for the time you have give i madam deputy speaker 
 i thank   the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins   for his speech although as my child say that be minute we will never get back even though i rise today represent a constituency that lie some mile from scotland much of what i hear from scottish colleague on both side of the house resonate deeply with i as a member from an island constituency although this bill may focus on matter far from isle of wight west it have give i a chance to reflect on some fond memory of scotland whether that be search for dolphin around nairn regularly visit edinburgh or my trip to faslane to learn about nuclear submarine i have a very fond memory of my visit to largs to work with the scottish office of the ellen macarthur cancer trust an organisation that do fantastic and vital work with child to rebuild their confidence after their battle with cancer its dedication be a powerful reminder that no matter the distance between our community we share common challenge and often share solution 
 during these visit to scotland i have always be strike by the warmth generosity and hospitality of the people i have meet whether that be in inverness edinburgh or in small town in between this hospitality reflect something deep than just kindness it speak to a strong sense of community openness and pride in welcome other and it be precisely that spirit that   should be at the part of any conversation about immigration immigration when do right should strengthen community not divide they it should reflect the same value that i have see across scotland and in my community on the isle of wight a desire to offer opportunity build belong and contribute to something great than ourselves 
 when i speak to my hon friend the members for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton and for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell i hear echo of my community on the isle of wight despite the geographical separation like they we be bind by the challenge of geography dependent on ferry service member would expect i to mention that to get to work or school receive vital good and supply and access healthcare and essential public service like they we too have be let down time and again by broken promise under investment and poor planning by the previous government i would not want to leave conservative members out 
 as hon member will know i have have more than a few choice word about the current ferry situation on the isle of wight but even i must admit that when compare with the so call scottish ferry fiasco our situation feel slightly less dire for those who be unfamiliar with that back in the scottish government award a contract worth £ to ferguson marine to build new ferry for calmac those ferry be mean to modernise the fleet improve reliability and serve island route such as arran and the western isles 
 be what my hon friend just mention not another example of the incompetence and failing of the snp frankly motion and bills like this be simply a disguise and design to pull the wool over the eye of people in scotland 
 my hon friend might not be surprised to hear that i be come to that point 
 the ferry be suppose to be operational by but here we be in and neither ferry have set sail 
 if the ferry be such a catastrophe would the hon gentleman care to explain why in a constituency with probably more ferry than any other in the uk i be re elect in and with the large snp majority in scotland if the ferry be that bad why do the people who use they vote snp 
 i think i thank the hon gentleman for his intervention i be sure that his constituent will be able to explain why 
 the project have be plague by delay after delay the cost have soar to more than £ and islander have be leave without the reliable transport they be promise vessel be now year behind schedule while the other may not set sail until not 20:26 by the hour clock but the year it be not just a failure of infrastructure but a failure of leadership a failure of accountability and most importantly a failure to respect the island community who rely on these lifeline service now the snp be ask we to entrust it with even great power over immigration never once while scan the horizon for dolphin off the coast of   nairn do i think that scotland should have its own separate immigration law or that that would solve everything 
 how the hon member have manage to bring ferry into a debate about a scottish visa be beyond i instead of focus on the issue that he see with capital project in scotland why do he not talk about some of the capital project failure in england 
 order may i remind hon member that this be a debate about why scotland should have devolve power over immigration 
 thank you madam deputy speaker you be quite right to keep we on track 
 the bill fail to account for its impact on the broad uk internal market if scotland be grant the power to admit migrant under its own criterion we will be leave with a host of unanswered question what be the mechanism for manage the flow of people across border how will we prevent an influx of people from move to other part of the uk without proper oversight 
 the hon member who until about minute ago be of the few people on the government benches i have any time for talk about what a catastrophe it would be if scotland could unilaterally control who come to work on our shore and who come to invest in our economy ironically he forget that that be exactly the encumbrance under which scotland exist now we get what england say we can get it be a disgrace and he be try to defend it defend it now 
 i thank my hon friend i will call he that for his calm and measured intervention as usual but i do believe that there be a referendum and we be all fully aware of the result i be sure i will still enjoy chat to he in future 
 i be sorry to interrupt my hon friend ’s excellent speech he speak about the flow of people what this clause bill do not set out be any control or mechanism by which that could be measure there be mention of ireland early i have a slight fear that this will turn into a debate about a soft and hard border and what that mean for the uk i find this very divisive do he agree 
 indeed i do for example will there be immigration check at the border what happen when someone grant immigration status in scotland seek work in newcastle manchester or london will employer in those city suddenly be task with verify whether an individual be subject to scottish immigration rule these be not just theoretical concern they be real logistical and administrative challenge without clarity and co ordination business across the uk could be force to navigate a confusing patchwork of immigration rule that add unnecessary complexity and cost to the workforce 
 i thank the hon member for give way he talk about the challenge of operate a system across   the scotland england border effectively that be not difficult in an age of digital technology do he agree that it could be easily achieve if we can achieve the arrangement that we have with ireland and a common travel area why could it not work to have a regional immigration system 
 the hon gentleman be ask we to take a leap of faith the bill be line if he have the answer to those question already the referendum result might well have be different interruption sorry the bill be line 
 the bill could create uncertainty for employer particularly in sector that rely on a flexible and diverse labour market such as construction healthcare and agriculture i have outline the similarity of my constituency to those of my scottish colleague but be i to suggest that the isle of wight have its own immigration law to help correct our demographic and workforce they would beg i to talk more about ferry 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech and he make a pertinent point that there be part of the united kingdom outside scotland that also suffer with demographic challenge of those be stoke on trent to suggest that stoke on trent should be able to issue its own visa or have its own immigration policy to solve that be for the bird give that the last government leave record high level of inward migration to this country do he agree that part of the solution be to think about how we make it more attractive to work in these place rather than simply rewrite the system for our own benefit 
 i agree entirely with my hon friend while the bill clearly seek to help and support employer in scotland with workforce issue consideration must also be give to employer in england that do not want an extra layer of bureaucracy add to their recruitment process moreover this bill do not explain how a devolved system would integrate with the exist national framework it be thing to talk about devolve power but where be the clarity on how the new system would coexist with the broad uk immigration process without the answer we risk create more confusion than solution with business local government and migrant alike catch in a web of complexity 
 do my hon friend agree that give that the snp have fail to run vital service in scotland we should not give it control of a border 
 i agree with my hon friend let we be clear that set up a separate immigration system in scotland would not come free or cheap we be talk about create entire new department new staff new infrastructure new it system and likely new border control all of which would need to be design staff and maintain who would foot the bill for that bureaucratic expansion it would be ordinary work people across the whole of the uk let we not forget that immigration be already a complex and resource intensive process under a single uk system 
 the hon member be ask we some valuable question on thing that need to be probe a little bit deep such as cost and complexity those be all matter we be have to consider under brexit which be cost £ a year interruption i can hear the chuntering but i be address the member on whom i be intervene hon member ooh be you surprised that be how a proper adult debate happen i ask the hon member this important question give that he be ask some legitimate question that he and we would like to explore why not bring the bill to a vote so that we can take it forward to committee to explore those question far 
 order before i call richard quigley may i just remind member that good temper and moderation be the hallmark of this parliament 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his intervention i wish i have all the answer to his question because i be sure it would have save we time it be now minute to and i could have have a long breakfast 
 duplicate thing for part of the country do not solve a problem it create if the snp can not manage a shipbuilding contract without go £ over budget what make we think it would manage immigration efficiently or affordably 
 will the hon member give way 
 i will make slightly more progress and then give way 
 the bill propose the devolution of immigration power to the scottish government under the argument that economic migration could support rural and island community let i be absolutely clear i agree that migration when do properly can be a lifeline it can bring new energy to struggle area provide vital worker and enrich our community but this bill with all the good will in the world fail to offer the security clarity or accountability need to deliver those outcome 
 when i come into this debate i do not expect the main thrust of the labour party ’s argument to be a concession that it will not win the next holyrood election labour members have consistently say that this be about hand power to the snp do they understand how democracy work or be they look at the poll and say oh my goodness we be totally in trouble before so it ’ get to be an snp government next year 
 that be a bit of a reach 
 how will the scottish government manage border security between england and scotland how will they ensure consistency with uk immigration policy how will they safeguard against misuse or confusion about legal status these question remain unanswered and regrettably this bill would create far more uncertainty than solution 
 be my hon friend aware that the scottish national party ’s own minister for independence have let the cat out of the bag and say that border   check be expect to be a hard reality in the future do my hon friend agree that this bill in its sentence be the trojan horse that will bring forward that hard reality 
 i be not aware of that but i think that this sentence bill be probably the snp ’s hard border to get any far 
 above all the most pressing question be this before those in the snp ask for more power why not demonstrate that they can effectively use the power they already have before reach for immigration lever hon member can all finish this line for i fix the ferry before seek new authority show that they can deliver on their current responsibility whether we be talk about those in the outer hebrides the isle of wight or any of the countless community that feel overlooked and underserved the people across scotland deserve far well than what they have receive so far they deserve competent leadership not constant excuse they deserve join up policy that work not duplication and distraction they deserve public service that be strong and reliable not stretch to the brink above all they deserve government at every level that be honest about what they can deliver and accountable when they do not 
 this bill may be wrap in the language of empowerment but in reality it risk become just another example of symbolism over substance 
 on the point about symbolism over substance do the hon member agree that we should have a vote on the bill today and dig into it in committee as would with any other bill i could not agree with he more 
 i do not agree with the hon gentleman not on the vote but we have not finish the debate so let we see how today play out 
 let we focus on what truly matter fix the system we already have strengthen the power that be already devolve and deliver on the promise already make people be not ask for grand gesture they be ask for real change 
 may i wholeheartedly congratulate my hon friend   the member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins   on introduce this vital and critical bill this morning i also commend he for the diplomatic and charming way that he always introduce these debate to the house he be very generous in take so many point of view this morning 
 before i make my substantial point i want to say a little bit about the tone of this house today when it be the conservatives sit on the government benches we collect what they say about scotland and all the issue to do with devolved government we stow they away and we use it against they now they be go utterly and totally go when scottish labour members speak scotland down as they have this morning we collect collate and keep those comment to use back against they i ever so gently suggest to my scottish friend on the labour benches that they look at the   by election result last night it be absolutely damn for the labour party whatever labour be do through this new attack of line against the scottish government it be singularly fail it will fail labour in the way that it fail the conservatives i caution labour members not to try to pit this house against the scottish parliament it do not work for the conservatives and it will not work for they 
 today be about the bill we be in real trouble in scotland and that be why the bill be critical there can be no doubt whatsoever that scotland be in the early stage of a population and demographic crisis that will get a lot bad unless we do something we can not leave thing in the condition that they be in with our fall birth rate we have too few working age people available to look after an ever old population we be in the early stage of population stagnation and we already see the impact we need only look at our health service which have difficulty recruit staff in our social care sector we be approach something like a workforce crisis i appeal to people to go and look not at the nuclear sub in clydebank but at rural area of scotland like mine they will find that hospitality and tourism business be cut back hour or closing because they do not have the staff to keep themselves properly function and organise 
 i be somewhat confused by the hon gentleman ’s speech he start off by accuse labour members of talk scotland down but then tell we that scotland be in crisis wonder who be in government at the time and continue his peroration by say that there be an age society i wonder if he will take some sort of responsibility or reflect on the fact that he seem to be talk down the independent scotland of which he dream 
 i be almost grateful for the intervention confused and clumsy as it be because i have a solution for the hon gentleman what we need when we face a crisis as we do now be solution what my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry have offer by start this conversation be a way to deal with the issue we face in scotland scotland be not unique the same thing be happen throughout the whole western industrialise world we face issue because birth rate across the world be fall calamitously every nation need to do something about the condition that they find themselves in today we be ask for a scottish response to the distinct circumstance we be deal with because we have get it really bad 
 our issue with the fall birth rate have be exacerbate not by anything that the scottish government be do as labour member suggest but because of what my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry say about brexit brexit have kill our population sustainability and population growth 
 the hon member talk about the consequence of brexit consequence be that we have see record soar net migration rate across the uk but the proportion of people come to scotland be low have he look at how the snp can attract immigrant and migrant to scotland without blame westminster 
 i wonder how long it would take to get to this point that be utter bunkum and rubbish the suggestion start by the conservatives but it seem to have be readily pick up by the labour party that we be not able to attract to scotland people from the rest of the united kingdom be utter rubbish the figure be at a record high why do the hon lady not look at the national records of scotland report which will tell she that we have the high net migration to scotland from the rest of the united kingdom that we have ever have 
 indicate dissent 
 the hon lady shake her head she have obviously not read the report i extoll she to do so because this nonsense have be allow to take hold for too long and it can not continue any long we have record net migration from the rest of the united kingdom believe i madam deputy speaker we do not get depressed about that we do not think that be a bad thing we think it be a positive we encourage people to come to scotland unlike labour members who discourage people from come to the united kingdom and who do everything possible to put up barrier and make life difficult and miserable for people try to come to the shore of the united kingdom we be the exact opposite in scotland scotland be not full up and we need people to come to our country i welcome anybody from the rest of the united kingdom who want to come to a beautiful place and a fantastic country to live in come to scotland i challenge any labour member to say to the rest of the world come to the united kingdom it be not in their cultural or political dna 
 we be in a difficult situation the simple fact be that scotland need more working age people to refresh our population if we do not get that we will be in serious trouble the same thing be happen all around the world but what the government be do with brexit be get in the way and make our issue bad do you know what else they be do although our birth rate be fall they be try to suppress it far through social engineering they be use the benefit system to deny benefit to working class people seek to have large family this be at a time when we should be do everything we can to encourage more child i want to hear the minister defend that policy when we have a crisis in scotland 
 how would the hon gentleman defend the snp government in holyrood who have fail on all the issue he have mention there be a broad point here about nationalism the snp government have to keep the circus on the road and have to keep tell people a line this be the late in a string of subject that keep people from talk about snp failure 
 i have no idea what the hon gentleman be say we be try to offer solution we have identify a range of difficulty that we have as a nation it be right and proper that they be examine analyse and address then we get down to the business of fix they and that be what we be do today this government be make our situation time bad through their inept callous and heinous attempt to socially engineer the benefit system to suppress our birth rate at the very time when we need more child we need large family 
 all around europe country face the same range of issue what be they do they be not have a child benefit cap they be incentivise young people to have child by give tax break and positive benefit to make sure that the birth rate increase what be the labour government do in the uk they be shamefully try to suppress our birth rate i challenge any of they to get to their foot and tell i how a child benefit cap help to increase our birth rate in scotland go on 
 order i remind the hon gentleman that this debate be about devolve immigration to scotland 
 okay right let we look at scotland ’s population then scotland ’s population be probably in the region of some estimate be and some be we have be in population decline since the latter part of the century this be an issue that particularly interest and excite i i think the scottish affairs committee have do report on it and i think secretary of state serve on the committee during of the inquiry on scotland ’s migration issue those be helpful report and hopefully they add to the debate i be glad that a few people have reference they we get down to the serious business of try to address the issue i congratulate the blair government which be visionary when it come to immigration it be imaginative tony blair open up eastern europe through accession which help our issue in scotland for a while that reverse our long term population decline 
 the tony blair government also give we fresh talent it give people an opportunity to come to study at of our world class university and stay and contribute to the scottish economy for a period of their early life it be fantastic it be back by the uk government and the scottish government with overwhelming support from hon member in this house the policy be then subsume by a general uk policy which mean that we lose our advantage 
 rise 
 i know that fresh talent be exciting and of interest to the secretary of state so i give way to he 
 i sit on the scottish affairs committee when it be chair by the hon gentleman and produce of those report on migration and depopulation in scotland i think it be during the to parliament and i remember that of the conclusion of the report be that the big type of migration out of scotland be to year old migrate to the rest of the uk we never answer why 
 absolutely i be go to come to that but it be good to look at that now there be reason for that although i be not entirely clear about they the committee do not get to the heart of that in its analysis we live in a united kingdom and have a massive mega city london so there be always the allure for young scot to come down to london i do it myself and i be pretty certain that the secretary of state spend a good part of his young life in london most scot at some point find themselves live in   london but it be bad than that for scotland because we have a century old historical culture and tradition of emigration immigration have not really be that big an issue for we we obviously benefit from it but the key feature in the history of scotland and this debate be emigration as everybody know there be scot community all around the world from canada and new zealand to the united states and they have always act as a draw for our young people not so much now but previously young scot settle abroad so we get into this cultural trend of people leave scotland we have to address that 
 other thing that the scottish affairs committee look at but do not come to any great conclusion about be deindustrialisation and its impact on encourage people to emigrate we obviously have deindustrialisation in scotland and we need only look at some of our major city and at the difficulty and feature of life in those city to see why people would leave we be wrestle with problem that successive uk government have bequeath scotland whether through brexit policy or the child benefit cap mix with the historical attitude to emigration and deindustrialisation those be the thing that my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry and his modest bill invite we to address 
 my hon friend have not get the solution in the bill he say that and that it be an open bill i be quite surprised that the secretary of state do not understand how committee work for private member bill my hon friend be give an invitation to the house i be lay out the difficulty and issue that we have identify i will get on to demography in scotland in a minute hon member should wait till they hear about that and my hon friend be say help we let we work together we have a real problem in scotland there be some fantastic contribution to be make with real in depth analysis by people who understand how to look at critical question and come up with solution help we deal with this so that we can address the range of issue that we have believe i if we do not start to address they we will be in really serious trouble 
 i have be listen with great interest to the hon gentleman we see from other country that there be way of deal with the issue without have full devolution for many of the reason that my hon friend   the member for isle of wight west mr quigley   lay out as be highlight early the home secretary make the scottish government an offer to work with the migration advisory committee on solution full devolution would be expensive and time consume and it would not deliver 
 this be helpful and i think my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry be hop for such positive contribution i be very much aware of the work that the migration advisory committee do and i commend it for that but its list of occupation require in scotland be not nearly enough it do not even touch the side of our difficulty if the hon lady have some thought on how that could be beef up and make more effective and useful we be all ear come and serve on the committee and help we we need positive solution to identify problem that be the territory we want to get into 
 we have long term population decline in scotland when i start to engage in this debate in the early 2000 there be a real fear that for the time since the century scotland ’s population would drop below the iconic mark that be only reverse because of the imagination of the previous labour government and their generosity when it come to immigration policy something that the current government would never even think about the vision of tony blair about how europe would work and how the single market would develop help scotland to address some of the issue 
 around the turn of the millennium i remember hear lord jack mcconnell the minister of scotland at the time talk about that iconic mark i be only or but i remember it be so important and it be so important to labour that immigration happen in order to keep that population why do he think labour have change its position so drastically in a relatively short space of time why be immigration now apparently bad 
 that be such a profound question i do not know how labour have get itself into this situation i suspect it be some sort of fear of reform whose member be not here today and labour be probably right to be frightened i think i see an opinion poll show that labour be now behind reform across the united kingdom labour member think and this will only exacerbate the problem that if they somehow pander to reform ’s agenda that will help they beat it nothing could delight reform more than go on to its agenda that be why we in scotland take reform on and tackle it 
 i be so pleased and impress that the minister of scotland this week get together a summit to take on these very challenge and i be delighted that the scottish labour leader attend that summit and take it seriously because this be the sort of thing we have to do when there be a challenge from the right we do not go on to their agenda that be what they want we take on their assumption we take they on politically and we beat they 
 that be why the snp have not be so impact by the rise of reform in the united kingdom because we take it on labour be start to experience difficulty at the hand of reform because it be look to pander to reform ’s agenda and move on to some of the uncomfortable territory we take reform on we do not pander to it that be the lesson of history 
 many labour members be actively in the business of take on the reform party whose member be absent once again from the chamber today i be not sure whether that be to our detriment or not many labour parliamentarian include i be proud of the contribution of immigration to our country we be still go to have net immigration under a labour government i be proud of the university of hertfordshire base in my constituency where more than of student be international student i be pleased that the hon member praise the scottish labour leader but please do not mischaracterise the position of labour members 
 i have no doubt that the hon member be utterly sincere i have listen to several remark from his labour colleague and some of they greatly impress i it encourage i to think that there be a little bit of a fight back i sit on the committee consider the border security asylum and immigration bill and i do not enjoy that for minute what i see be a range of initiative and policy that could basically have come from the conservatives it be very much the same sort of theme and trend immigration be bad it have to be curb it have to be take on and deal with it be never see as a positive i encourage the hon gentleman to speak up do more of this and encourage his colleague to speak out clearly on these issue that be what we need we be in a political crisis at a juncture in our political culture and history and we need brave gentleman like he to stand up there and take it on rather than listen to his front benchers the home secretary in particular have a track record on this he need to challenge she and the home office 
 the hon member have speak at great length about the benefit of immigration i be married to an eastern european immigrant so i be well aware of the massive benefit of immigration to this country what i be bit confused about though be how add an extra layer of red tape and a potential border between england and scotland would improve or make a difference to what he have just talk about 
 i be go to leave that point until later in my speech but the hon gentleman tempt i to get on to that territory now he be obviously look for some sort of solution i will try to explain our plan and intention to he as well i can as well as where i think this matter should eventually go 
 when i chair the scottish affairs committee we be lucky enough to go to quebec to look at its state wide immigration system which be fantastic member should go to montreal and have a look the construction there it be a boom city it be able to do that because the quebecois state parliament be able to gain control over immigration from the state government as a result quebec can appeal to francophone europe to think about settle there thereby attract the specific skill that be lack that have lead to such incredible growth in quebec which be in charge of its immigration system that work in canada be we try to suggest that what people call the most powerful devolve parliament in the world could not come up with a similar or even more effective system than what we see in canada that be what we can do if we have the imagination 
 the hon member for banbury sean woodcock   ask how this would work i think i hear somebody talk about border guard and passport control between scotland and england in the past year scotland have acquire significant new power over taxation we can have a debate about that at some other point which have allow we to set up revenue scotland so all of we in scotland have a different tax code from everybody else throughout the united kingdom that individual scottish tax code allow we to know where people be live and work if they have such a tax code they be pay taxis in scotland 
 if we have a scottish visa of the condition for people come to scotland from outwith the united kingdom would be for they to have a scottish tax code   that would allow we to monitor where they be live and work of the condition for their come in would be to be resident and work in scotland if they break the condition for their entry to scotland they would no long be entitle to a scottish visa and would be make illegal who on earth would do that why would somebody not want the opportunity to live in scotland there be practical solution that other nation use surely nobody be suggest that scotland could not introduce such a scheme it have be do before we have already talk about fresh talent labour have give scotland an advantage in immigration before and could do it again it be not beyond the wit of the scottish nation to ensure that we have an immigration system and a specific tax code but we need the mean to do it 
 there be another issue that i wish to take on which i address in response to an intervention and that be the idea that scotland do not get any migrant from the rest of the uk that they do not want to come to scotland that be just utter bunkum and rubbish i hope that after this debate that suggestion will never be make again because it be just rubbish i will give the house a few statistic accord to the national records of scotland in the year lead up to mid-2022 net migration from the rest of the uk to scotland increase to up from the previous year the trend continue with net internal migration rise to in the year to june the last figure interruption that be a year high and high than pre pandemic level 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 just a minute be patient 
 people come to scotland from the rest of the united kingdom because of our more affordable living cost thing such as free university tuition and free personal care our progressive social contract and the fact that it be a beautiful and great country to stay in of course people come to scotland let we knock this on the head i do not know whether the hon lady have get a point about this i be keen to hear what it be 
 the hon gentleman be mischaracterise what i say we be not talk about absolute figure yes the figure have rise but they be disproportionately low than for the rest of the uk once i find it if the hon gentleman will let i i will quote directly from the national records of scotland 
 i be sorry i think i be go to get the figure we do way beyond our national share when it come to inward migration so please let we have no more of this let we just agree that people come to scotland and we want more to do so 
 regardless of how successful we have be in attract people we be still in a situation of long term population decline in scotland that be the population but the demography of scotland be a big horror story and it be thing that we really need to look at some of scotland ’s population be over which be of the high ratio in the whole of the western world i think the figure for england be we have a birth rate of child for every woman again of the bad rate in the whole of the industrialise world i do   not need to lecture hon member about what the birth rate mean we need child for every woman just to sustain the population at its current level a birth rate of child for every woman can not be sustainable that be what make the child benefit cap all the more absurd heinous and callous this government be work contrary to what we need in scotland to address some of these issue 
 therefore give our fall birth rate we be entirely dependent on immigration to keep our population at current level and maybe to increase it modestly for the prospect of economic growth of the few ambition and commitment that this government be stick to be to cut net migration that be their absolute and utter mission they will not even bring forward a youth mobility scheme in all its glory because of their concern about the impact on net migration scotland be burden with an immigration system and a set of government policy that make our situation so much bad why do you think that we consistently call for this power to be devolve no scottish labour mp have stand up and oppose that commitment if they be not go to do it they should give the power to we and allow we to do so 
 all over the world the population of western industrial country be face these difficulty they have get the power to address they we have see example in italy and spain which have particularly bad birth rate almost on a par with what scotland have they have ministry devote to try to increase the birth rate and do something about the impending crisis that be come their way even in china population stagnation be begin to take hold the world population will stop grow in about and at that point there will be stagnation before rapid population fall it be at the point where that curve start to bend that we get stagnation which be why nation be address the issue that they have 
 have a look at japan historically resistant to immigration japan be go through a structural economic crisis because of its demography and population issue its population be due to fall by in the next year because of the fall birth rate it be go to fall from in the gdp ranking to that be what await the united kingdom over the course of the next or year this government can not look far than the nose on their face all they be see just now be reform and all they be think about be how do we take they on how do we beat they there be no strategic thinking or long term vision about what we will do towards the end of the century when all of this start to take hold nothing no imagination no inquiry but this be where we be go 
 it might blow some member mind but towards the end of the century migrant might be at a premium and there will be a competition to try to get people into nation around the world i know that be too much for they to start to contemplate just now but that be where we be go and yet for they the issue be about curb migration they see migration as a problem that have to be manage with no concession or ground give to anything that might get in the way of the net migration figure we be lumber with that in scotland where we want to move on and deal with our issue we can not do so but we should be able to do that 
 we hear from my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry about the support that the measure in the bill have in scotland that be no surprise because business organisation and think tank have see what be go on they just need to look at some of our sector to find that there be a crisis in practically every and in our public service so of course they support the measure there be even political consensus in the scottish parliament that something need to be do the only thing be we need the uk government to get on board and the bill before we today will help to achieve those goal 
 as my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry concede from the outset the bill be not perfect it be a line bill but invitation be there to get it to committee—[interruption i say to member on the labour benches include   the hon member for isle of wight west mr quigley colleague from the conservative party and the liberal democrats who be not here we have identify the issue if somebody think that we have get all of this wrong i want to hear from they i do not want to hear about what the scottish government be do with ferry or whatever it be they want to talk about—[interruption this be the thing madam deputy speaker government members do not want to talk about the issue that be important to we in this house they want to talk about stuff that be devolve to the scottish parliament be that because they think their member of the scottish parliament be not up to the job so labour members in this house have to constantly go on about those thing the secretary of state can confirm but i think labour have about msp up in scotland why not let they get on with their job while we deal with the thing that we need to fix down here 
 immigration be wrap up in a lot of policy area that be devolve to the scottish parliament the scottish government themselves in parliament declare a housing emergency do the hon gentleman think that the lack of housing in scotland have anything to do with the inability to attract migrant to do the job in the place where they be need to do they 
 i think that we be go to have quite a few debate like this in the next few year so i say this ever so candidly that be a matter for the scottish parliament to resolve 
 the secretary of state ’s party be try to become the party in government in scotland next year but his party do not have any imaginative solution so over the next year we will be test his proposal and policy against what we be do if people in scotland be attract to the secretary of state ’s policy and proposal they will vote labour in but i do not think that will happen and i think in his heart of heart he also believe that now we only need to look at the last by election result so when we be elect to this house let we deal with the thing that matter to we and nothing be more important than this issue if we do not get this fix we will have serious issue and structural problem in our public service and our economy i appeal to the house let the bill go through and then let we all work together to resolve the situation 
 it be an honour to follow   the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart my vice chair of the all party parliamentary beer group which be a very important group i agree with he about how beautiful scotland be and i be interested to hear some practical idea on how we can increase the scottish population i be sure that the birth rate could be incentivise by the scottish government perhaps with tax relief for more baby that be just an idea 
 the hon gentleman talk about pander to the reform agenda but i do not think any hon member in this house from any party be immune to the danger of reform ’s rhetoric he be misguide in say that labour members be the one pallye up to reform i agree with many of the intervention from labour members today and i will make a few further point although i hate to burst the snp ’s bubble since july scottish labour have win third of by election many many congratulation to my friend in scotland also as a former french teacher i be very familiar with québec which be a wonderful place it have have referendum and people have vote remain twice independence happen to be off the agenda so perhaps the snp need to study that a bit more 
 i would like to echo the word of my hon friend and i wonder when james v of scotland become james i do he ever think that after year 
 james vi 
 the snp members be right i be really rubbish at roman numeral i have suffer with that since i be a child so i put that down to my lack of intelligence around roman numeral my note do actually say vi”—i just can not do they but at least i can admit to my failing when james vi of scotland become james i do he ever think that after year and multiple act of parliament and referendum we would still be have these conversation either way he have a more successful career in the monarchy than llywelyn ap gruffudd the last prince of wales 
 as a welsh mp who be the chair of the select committee on northern ireland affairs perhaps i be destine to be involve in a debate on scottish devolution i believe of course that devolve power be right and i appreciate that year of a tory government here have leave a very sour taste in the devolved nation mouth include in wales but i can not agree with devolve immigration to the scottish government the notion that this should be a priority for the snp here or in holyrood be frankly for the bird after a shocking result in the general election for the snp surely now the priority be to rebuild trust before the scottish election and rebuild that trust be difficult guy if we look at the record in scotland we see that almost in scot be on an nhs waiting list we see fall standard and rise violence in our once world lead school while the poverty relate attainment gap in higher be at its widest ever and hon member know how much i care about that 
 before the hon member get to the end of her prepared litany of apparent failure in scotland she might want to touch on the far great spending on   education and health in scotland but just to get clarity on this issue in this grotesque thing that be the united kingdom can she give i measure because i know she be super smart on which the devolve welsh government perform well than the snp government in scotland 
 that old chestnut madam deputy speaker i have be part of that system as a teacher and i know what the high point be actually i do not think there be any comparator when the scottish government have have a lot more money to play with from their barnett formula consequential 
 i want to move on to something that be very close to my heart the supreme court judgment for which scottish woman have to bring a case to the supreme court i just think we have not do anybody right and that come from the snp government and their agenda in scotland we have see how nhs fife be treat the nurse sandie peggie we know how they be treat woman and girl there be a brilliant book call the women who would n’t wheesht by lucy hunter blackburn and susan dalgety it have essay with woman ’s voice on the situation in scotland from the frontline of the battle for woman ’s right it be a compelling read madam deputy speaker i can get you a copy so many woman have have their reputation throw under a bus and their job ruin and their relationship with family and friend have go 
 my hon friend rightly point out the outrageous situation that so many woman in scotland have face over the last few year do she agree that if scotland want to attract more immigrant and more migrant it need to understand woman ’s issue more coherently 
 order i be grateful for that intervention because i remind member to please keep in scope of the bill 
 that be the point i be go to make if we want to make scotland a more attractive place to go we have to be inclusive and ensure that we look after woman and girl
