as ever my hon friend raise an excellent point that be what operation prosperity guardian be all about that taskforce enable ship to be protect to an extent he may be get at the broad point of whether individual ship should be protect the view that the world have take be that prosperity guardian provide an umbrella to ship more widely the sheer volume of ordinary traffic through the red sea mean that we need that us lead international taskforce for the security of the red sea and the gulf of aden 
 this be incredibly important after all we be part of defend the international rule base order in the action that we be take last week i be onboard hms diamond which be right at the heart of the issue in the red sea talk to our brave sailor who be out there protect our critical sea lane the house will know that this be the royal navy ship ’s company for year who have fire in anger or in self defence in their case it be fascinating to talk to they about their experience and to witness their professionalism in deal with this challenge 
 it really do not have to be this way we work hard to warn the houthis off at the start of the year the world send a very clear message to the houthis end your illegal and unjustified action stop risk innocent life please stop illegally detain vessel and crew cease threaten the global economy all those warning fall on deaf ear and eventually enough be enough 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the advocate general for scotland on the prosecution of postmaster use evidence from the horizon it system 
 as you know mr speaker the secretary of state have suffer a family bereavement this week so will not be with we today i be sure that the whole house will wish to send he and his family our deep condolence can we also pause to think about the community include those in my own area in the scottish border that have be devastate by the recent storm i know that the emergency service council and power company worker be support they as well they can lastly mr speaker i wish you a happy burns night which will be celebrate around the world tomorrow 
 the ongoing situation with the post office and horizon be clearly very serious we need to ensure that all sub postmaster wrongly prosecute finally get justice no matter where they reside in the uk i assure the hon lady that my official be work at pace with the office of the advocate general and other key uk government departments to consider the issue around wrongful conviction 
 in scotland these prosecution be carry out by the crown office and the procurator fiscal minister of the crown be make aware of concern around potentially unsafe prosecution in can the minister tell the house why it take so long for the prosecution to be halt and for previous conviction to be review 
 the horizon scandal be of the great miscarriage of justice in this country ’s history with hundred of people have their life ruin and reputation drag through the mud the prime minister have announce new law that will be introduce to ensure that those wrongly convict be exonerate and swiftly compensate here in england as the hon lady will know the administration of justice be devolve but the uk government be in contact with the scottish government to explore the most effective way to exonerate and compensate those innocent people 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i pass the thought of the opposition to the secretary of state at this difficult time and join the minister in his comment about all those affect by flooding 
 the scandal of the unjustified prosecution of sub postmaster the length and breadth of this country be almost beyond word although it should not have take a tv drama to get action it be good that those find guilty in england will now have their conviction quash but meanwhile in scotland we be no clear on how those wrongly convict will get justice the minister initially claim that he would be happy for this parliament to legislate for every victim across the uk but his lord advocate then say that she do not support blanket exoneration what be the minister do to ensure that those who be wrongly convict in scotland finally get the justice they deserve 
 official from the uk government be work with their counterpart from the various devolved administration include the scottish government to fully understand the legislative option that be available across the respective jurisdiction i reassure the hon member that it remain a priority for all concerned to ensure that those sub postmaster receive justice and the compensation to which they be entitle as quickly as possible irrespective of where they live in the united kingdom 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support for the oil and gas industry in scotland 
 oil and gas be and will remain a vital sector for the uk the uk government be commit to support the industry that be why last week i attend the grangemouth future industry board with other uk and scottish government ministers on the transformation of the grangemouth oil refinery the introduction of the offshore petroleum licensing bill demonstrate our ongoing investment in the industry 
 my hon friend know that scotland have the potential to be of the world ’s most advanced producer of hydrogen and oil and gas company be play an important role in that transition what be the department do to support oil and gas company which employ a huge number of people in scotland and in my seat of rother valley in build their hydrogen production transmission and use capability to ramp up the production of hydrogen so that we can get more of the low carbon energy that we so need 
 we anticipate that by the uk ’s grow hydrogen sector could support more than job and unlock £ worth of private investment our hydrogen production delivery road map set out proposal for annual hydrogen allocation round from to help to provide certainty for the industry in december we announce the result of hydrogen allocation round with scotland field successful project 
 the renewable sector provide the great job growth for scotland ’s energy sector with the number of job in the renewable sector in scotland grow by more than in the future of scotland ’s job security energy and economy lie with renewable when will the uk government finally match support for the scottish government ’s £ just transition fund 
 the snp ’s position on energy particularly in relation to oil and gas be frankly all over the place we do not know where the minister of scotland stand on this he describe develop rosebank as the wrong decision but now seem to think that oil reserve can fund capital investment in an independent scotland we fully recognise the importance of the energy sector to scotland that include oil and gas and renewable i will continue to work with all part of the energy sector to develop that for the scottish economy 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of level up in scotland 
 the uk government ’s funding for level up have now reach more than £ in scotland that include almost £ of new funding announce last year that be the equivalent of £ per person in scotland and the total be set to rise with million of pound of further investment in 
 the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities   the hon member for redcar jacob young will meet i on friday but sadly that be not a courtesy that have be extend to the leader of dundee city council who have repeatedly invite the minister to a roundtable in the city to discuss funding that be critical to project such as the eden project and the life sciences innovation district among other i have seek to continue the long term investment and regeneration of the city through those project in the tay cities region deal will the minister assure i that he will urge his colleague to include those in our discussion on friday and that his dreadful lack of engagement be from a uk government that be commit to level up not an outgoing government wind down 
 the uk government be invest more than £ in project in dundee and those project have be identify as key priority by dundee city council and other local partner the hon member mention the leader of dundee city council after receive £ for dundee from uk levelling up fund the snp leader of dundee council recently say 
 this be just the uk government element i ’m pursue the scottish government as well because we need both government to work with we if we ’re to make significant economic inroad into the challenge we face 
 i hope the hon member will agree to write a joint letter with i to his snp colleague in holyrood ask where be the money 
 we now come to snp spokesperson 
 on behalf of myself and my colleague i ask the minister to also convey our condolence to the secretary of state we be give assurance prior to brexit that the structural fund that provide the capital funding for scotland would be replace by specific levelling up and share prosperity funding after brexit can the minister say how that funding from those source compare to what it be prior to leave the eu 
 year since the united kingdom leave the eu the uk government have announce more than £ for new levelling up initiative across scotland that exceed the entire year budget for the eu structural and investment fund for scotland for to roughly £ of funding so i do not accept the analysis the hon member present 
 well no it do not actually because this government have a tendency to draw all source of capital funding into its levelling up myth i be talk about the specific levelling up fund and the share prosperity fund they have give scotland £ and £ respectively that be exactly £ short of the £ that come from the eu structural fund so when can we have the money please 
 the hon member be simply not correct £ have be invest by this government into community the length and breadth of scotland i know that snp members have fight tooth and nail to stop that investment be deliver to those local community but this conservative government will continue to invest directly into scotland 
 whether he have have discussion with the scottish government on funding for nursing bursary for those study in scotland 
 funding policy for those study in scotland include nursing student be a matter for the scottish government the uk government support collaboration between our nation to share good practice and provide well healthcare service we would be open to future discussion with the scottish government about this matter 
 my constituent have be deny additional funding for her nursing degree because she be domicile in england but study in scotland whereas those study in england can access the funding regardless of where they be domicile what advice can the government give i to help my constituent 
 nursing bursary for those wish to study in scotland be a matter for the scottish government unfortunately the scottish government only provide bursary support for scottish domicile nursing student and only if they be enrol in a course that lead to a diploma in scotland in contrast the uk government ensure that the learn support fund be available to all uk student study at english university regardless of where they be domicile i will be happy on behalf of the hon lady to set up a meeting with my colleague in the department of health and social care to see how we might be able to pursue the matter far 
 whether he have make a recent assessment of the impact of import and export requirement follow the uk ’s exit from the eu on scottish business 
 whether he have make a recent assessment of the impact of import and export requirement follow the uk ’s exit from the eu on scottish business 
 the late official figure speak for themselves and show sustained increase in both the import and export of good between scotland and the eu with healthy result for service too 
 the brexit pain continue with £ wipe off the uk economy and more regulation make it tough for exporter relative to similarly sized country scotland ’s export be under real pressure theme in the minister ’s industrial strategy be to become an independent nation and to rejoin the eu all the evidence point to the fact that that be the correct course of action do it not 
 no it do not scotland continue to punch above its weight in export good and service and foreign direct investment trade be now well above pre brexit level 
 accord to the government ’s own figure new brexit control will cost the uk £ business in glasgow be tell i they be already suffer from increase cost and red tape when import part and export good can the minister explain to business in my glasgow north west constituency how brexit be good for they 
 the hon lady and the snp really do have a brass neck speak about business cost give their own policy of set up a hard border at berwick next to my constituency that would risk thousand of job and force thousand of company out of business it would be a most damaging and reckless economic step we will work through any short term issue but the answer be not the long term decline propose by the snp 
 what recent step his department have take to help support the scottish economy 
 support economic growth in scotland remain a core priority of the scotland office we be focus on long term economic growth generate more job and boost business investment that be exemplify by investment of up to £ in the scottish freeport and investment zone programme on top of our £ worth of investment into growth deal across the whole of scotland 
 the former right hon member for kingswood and government net tsar chris skidmore say that what business and investor need from the government be certainty clarity consistency and continuity never have that be more true than in scotland where there be huge potential for business and community to flourish as a result of the green transition however they be not get the certainty clarity consistency and continuity that they need from this government be they 
 i do not accept that analysis for example the uk have a world lead ambition to deploy up to gw of offshore wind by the year with up to gw come from offshore float wind offshore wind provide secure domestically generate electricity and will play a key role in decarbonise the uk power system by achieve net by i do not share the hon lady ’s analysis of this government ’s focus in that area 
 do the minister share my frustration that while his department be work to support the scottish economy the snp be hit it with high taxis and be not support vital sector such as hospitality in the way that be happen in england 
 my hon friend be absolutely right sadly the snp ’s sole focus seem to be independence referendum and make scotland the part of the united kingdom with the high tax i see that every day of the week in my constituency as people find it increasingly difficult to justify remain in scotland when they be pay so much more tax compare with the rest of the uk while get less good public service 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i join the minister in pass on our condolence to the secretary of state and his family on their bereavement i also wish everyone a happy burns day for tomorrow i thank the wonderful ayrshire musician in the public gallery who treat we to some entertainment last night 
 since the government have be in power work people have pay on average 10p on the pound more in tax the supposed party of low tax have create the high tax burden on work people in year make this the big tax raise parliament since record begin in scotland the snp have look at that tax burden and say hold my beer as everyone earn more than £ pay even more tax than they would in england what impact do the minister think that historically high tax burden have on the scottish economy 
 the government remain focused on reduce the tax burden when it be prudent to do so but as the hon gentleman identifie we have an additional challenge in scotland in the high tax agenda put forward by the snp scottish government i share his concern about the impact that that be have on the ability of the scottish economy to perform to its full potential 
 the minister seem to think that have your pocket pick for £ and get £ back be something to be grateful for the fact be that work people all across the country include in scotland be   pay for the tories crash of the economy we know that the barnett formula result in an additional £ of public spending in scotland ’s economy but last week the national report that the snp be be encourage by its sister party in wales to join the campaign to ditch the funding formula 
 year of snp government have leave scotland ’s public finance with a £ black hole we be in the middle of the bad cost of live crisis in generation yet historically high taxis be already be impose on work people to pay for it lose the barnett formula would devastate scotland ’s public finance and economy like nothing we have see before will the minister join i in demand that the snp rule out the policy to bin the barnett formula 
 the big enemy of the barnett formula and of devolution in scotland be the snp it want to rip up the devolution settlement and stop the barnett formula which result in million of pound of extra investment go into scotland each year the conservative government remain absolutely committed to devolution the barnett formula and more investment into scotland 
 whether he be take step to promote co operation between business in scotland and northern ireland 
 the united kingdom government have take action to make trade between scotland and northern ireland easy the uk government have also commit to provide funding to deliver target improvement to the a75 that will provide well link between the cairnryan ferry terminal serve northern ireland and south west scotland benefit business on both side of the north channel 
 the minister will like many understand that the economic powerhouse of the united kingdom be usually centre in the south east of england to the detriment of the south west of scotland and northern ireland will he do more to ensure that that small mile stretch of water between scotland and northern ireland be bridge in business term by great co operation and expansion opportunity for people on either side of it 
 the hon member make an important point i fully recognise the strong link between south scotland and northern ireland and the potential to enhance those economic tie be great improved transport link include the a75 and ferry link be undoubtedly part of that i look forward to work with he to see how we might be able to enhance and improve those link 
 i call the chair of the scottish affairs committee 
 scottish business would give their right arm to have the arrangement that northern irish business have    with their access to the single market and all the competitive advantage that that bring the prime minister have describe northern ireland as of the 
 world ’s most exciting economic zone 
 do the minister agree with that and what be he do to ensure that scotland get the same arrangement 
 i think that the hon member be go to stand up and tell i how great the house of lords be a bit like his colleague   the right hon member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford in a sort of pre emptive job application 
 scotland be not northern ireland and do not share a land border with an eu country it be disappointing that the snp be seek to play party politic with the situation in northern ireland which as the snp well know have a unique place in the united kingdom and we will protect that 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on promote scotland overseas 
 the uk government work tirelessly to promote scottish interest around the world through our extensive diplomatic network forge business link and generate trade and investment our response to the scottish affairs committee ’s recent inquiry on scotland ’s international position highlight the extensive effort we undertake to achieve this 
 i be afraid that i do not share the minister ’s panglossian view of this issue do he share my concern about recently publish figure that show that in the year to scottish export to the eu fall from £ to £ whatever the uk government be do it be not work so the scottish government have a press need to promote ourselves overseas for the sake of our economy and our society do the minister agree that now be the time to increase that overseas promotion not cut it back due to domestic wrangle 
 give the hon member ’s interest in this area perhaps he could speak with his snp colleague in the scottish parliament they be cut funding to south of scotland enterprise which will mean less support for business in the south of scotland to grow innovate and export perhaps he could tell the minister of scotland that promote scotland overseas begin with support business at home in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on ambulance wait time in scotland 
 the uk government recognise the important job that all nhs worker do include those in the ambulance service i see that every day of the week in my own constituency in the scottish borders   the uk government would be open to explore with the scottish government how we can work together and share good practice to reduce ambulance waiting time in all part of the united kingdom 
 last year in scotland almost people have to wait more than hour for an ambulance but in recent day woman who might have to travel a and a half hour drive to raigmore hospital in inverness to give birth or for specialist treatment have not be able to travel at all because the road have be close owe to the terrible weather we have have do the minister share my deep anxiety for any woman who live over mile from raigmore hospital 
 i share the hon member ’s concern and agree that those long distance be not acceptable but it tell we all we need to know about the nhs in rural scotland nhs highland have say that it will need to substantially reduce spend follow the snp government ’s budget in december the snp government be take a slash and burn approach to the rural nhs across scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn statement on the scottish economy 
 the autumn statement support family and set out measure to grow the scottish economy with a strong fiscal outlook the government have the space to cut taxis for hard work people and business that be highlight by cut to national insurance benefit people in scotland and the extension of full expensing ensure that the uk have of the most competitive business tax regime in the world 
 order will member please not walk in front of other member while they be ask question 
 the minister be correct that the autumn statement from this uk conservative government provide tax cut for million of scot provide support for business and invest to grow the economy that be in stark contrast to the snp ’s budget last month which hike taxis on hard work scot fail to pass on support to the hospitality retail and tourism sector and have be widely criticise across scotland do the minister agree as i do with sir tom hunter who say at the weekend that the business community in scotland do not believe that the snp have its back and do he agree that that must change 
 i agree with my hon friend and sir tom be right too trader in scotland have accuse the snp government of undermine the rejuvenation of high street across scotland with their tax hike of through business rate the snp must stop attack employer and high street trader who be already under tremendous financial strain because of the snp ’s mismanagement of scotland ’s economy 
 despite devolution render it pointless the budget of the scotland office along with that of the attorney    general have jump by over £ since it leapt up by £ just last year while the scottish government ’s budget allocation suffer a real term cut around people currently work for the scotland office in queen elizabeth house alone along with around civil servant from the department for levelling up housing and communities what on earth be they do and how do the minister justify that to the scottish taxpayer 
 the team at the scotland office both in dover house and in queen elizabeth house in edinburgh be do a tremendous job support scotland across the united kingdom and around the world i would be very happy to welcome the hon lady to meet some of they with i so that she can understand more clearly the important work that they do on our behalf across the uk 
 rise 
 order that complete scottish question we now come to prime minister ’s question but i just want to announce to the house that we be join today by the president of the chamber of deputies of the parliament of the czech republic welcome 
 hear hear 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january 
 i know that member across the house will want to join i in offer our good wish to his majesty the king and her royal highness the princess of wales 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house this afternoon i shall be meet the extraordinary year old holocaust survivor lily ebert lily promise that if she survive auschwitz she would tell the world the truth of what happen never have such a promise be so profoundly fulfil as we prepare to mark holocaust memorial day on saturday i be sure the whole house will join i in reaffirm our promise to lily that we will never forget the holocaust and we will carry forward her life ’s work for generation to come 
 can i echo the prime minister ’s comment on international holocaust memorial day 
 my constituent like all of our constituent rely on the royal mail to deliver important item of mail and package and for people to run their business so they will be very alarmed to learn of the proposal from ofcom that royal mail might be allow to cut the number of day that it will provide that service will the prime minister give a commitment to i here today that on his watch there will be no reduction in the postal service provide by the royal mail in scotland or anywhere else 
 i agree with the hon gentleman about the importance of the royal mail ’s universal service obligation as the hon member will have hear this morning from the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake we remain absolutely committed to ensure that it remain as it be 
 the lib dem run council in eastleigh have just receive a report from its external auditor warn of the possibility of fraud and ignore whistleblower who try to warn it do the prime minister agree that lib dem leader who shun accountability shun transparency and simply say not i guv should start show some remorse and responsibility or make way for those who will 
 my—[interruption 
 order i want to hear the answer 
 my hon friend raise an important matter to the people of eastleigh which i be pleased to discuss with he on my recent visit to his area and i know that the content of the report be deeply concern it be disappointing to see this lib dem run council rack up debt with absolutely no plan for how to fund it the council have be issue with a good value notice and i know that he be talk to the department for levelling up housing and communities which will be monitor this situation closely 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 thank you mr speaker can i join the prime minster in his comment about his majesty the king and her royal highness the princess of wales and in his comment about holocaust memorial day never again must be say more defiantly this year as it be say every year 
 last week we lose sir tony lloyd a true public servant who touch the life of many people across the house and across the country i be glad that his family be here yesterday to hear the many tribute to and memory of tony he will be greatly miss 
 the prime minister have have quite a week from endlessly fight with his own mps to collapse in laughter when he be ask by a member of the public about nhs waiting list so i be glad to hear that he manage to take some time off—[interruption 
 order i want to hear the prime minister and i be certainly go to hear the leader of the opposition those on the conservative benches who do not want to hear he can certainly leave that be how it be go to be so get in order some of you will be want to catch my eye again and that be not a good way to do it 
 i love this quaint tradition where the more they slag he off behind his back the louder they cheer he here 
 more 
 the same go for those on the labour benches you can have a joint cup of tea 
 i be glad to see that the prime minister manage to get some time off yesterday afternoon to kick back relax and accidentally record a candid video for nigel farage the only thing miss from that punishing schedule be any sort of governing or leadership so be he surprised to see of his own mp say 
 he do not get what britain need and he be not listen to what people want 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about what britain need what britain want and what britain value and that from the man who take the knee who want to abolish the monarchy and who still do not know what a woman be just this week of his front benchers say that they back teach divisive white privilege in our school look at his record it be crystal clear which of we do not get britain ’s value 
 the prime minister spout so much nonsense no wonder they be give up on he even now as his government crumble around he and his own mps point out that he be out of touch and have no plan for growth crime or building house the prime minister be stick to his man pollyanna show everything be fine people should be grateful for he the trouble be that no be buy it do he actually understand why his own mp say that he do not understand britain and that he be an obstacle to recovery 
 again the right hon and learn gentleman call it nonsense but these be his position he do not want to talk about it but these be the fact he choose to represent a now proscribe terrorist group he choose to campaign against the deportation of foreign national offender just like he choose to serve   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn that be his record those be his value and that be exactly how he should be judge 
 in i be the director of public prosecutions put terrorist and murderer in jail the prime minister be make million bet on the misery of work people during the financial crisis we have see this story time and again with this lot party country safely ensconce in westminster they get down to the real business of fight each other to death the country be force to endure their division and chaos the long episode of eastenders ever put to film 
 meanwhile this week we discover that britain be go to be the only major economy that no long make its own steel that the government be hand out £ to make steelworker redundant and that the parent of thousand be be tell that his free childcare promise be nothing but a mirage be he not embarrassed that the tory party be yet again entirely focused on itself 
 yet more snip from the sideline mr speaker you can see exactly why hizb ut tahrir hire he in the place the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about these thing but even   member of his own party be now realise that he simply do not have a plan for this country   the hon member for dagenham and rainham jon cruddas   say that it be difficult to identify the purpose of his leadership and long time celebrity backer steve coogan recently say that 
 he lick his finger stick it up in the air see which way the wind be blow 
 even the labour party know that he be not a leader he be a human weathervane 
 it be not the sideline but from behind he that the fire be come the prime minister can try to blame the labour party all he want but the difference be that i have change my party he be bully by his party have he find time in his busy schedule to work out why thousand of parent be be tell by their nursery that they will not get the free childcare that he promise they 
 let we see what the labour party be offer the country we all know that he do not have many idea for our country—[interruption 
 order i be go to hear the prime minister 
 thing that we do know—[interruption 
 order member do not want to push it do they no 
 we do know that the right hon and learn gentleman be committed to his decarbonisation promise which the opposition say will cost £ i be read about it this week he say that he have change the party but of his team call that promise an albatross hang around their neck that might have be the shadow chancellor but he say they be double down on it and all this be ahead of a crunch meeting this week we be tell for the opposition to work out how they will pay for that i can save they some time because we all know the answer high taxis for the british people 
 there be only party that crash the economy and they be sit right there interruption 
 order mr holmes you have have your question already obviously you do not want to remain for the rest of question 
 the prime minister be mr tax rise and he have nothing to say on childcare million of family will have be listen for an answer and they get absolutely nothing he announce the scheme a year ago claim that it would get parent back into work only on monday this week do he notice that there be in his word some practical issue with that week before its launch parent can not budget plan for work or make arrangement with their employer the prime minister ’s response be to say it ’ all fine it ’ the fault of the labour party be this merely a practical issue or be it yet another example of he simply not understand how life work for other people 
 we be deliver the big ever expansion of childcare in this country ’s history while million of parent will benefit from that it be right that the right hon and learn gentleman should come clean with they about the cost that his plan will impose on all of they he go on and on about the green promise he say he want to keep it but he do not have a plan to pay for it what he be really say be that he will scrap the borrowing associate with it but he want to keep the £ of spending for all those work family who be benefit from our free childcare why do he not come clean with they now and be clear that his plan mean it be back to square and high taxis for british people 
 make steelworker redundant and fail to provide childcare be not a plan prime minister it be a farce he may soon discover that with childcare there be an it problem nursery do not have the space they have not get the staff there be a black hole in their budget and there be week to go that be not a plan interruption government member can laugh all they like but family be make plan now family be struggle with the cost of living crisis try to work out the household budget balance spiral mortgage price and eye watering bill and then at the last minute they be throw into chaos because their nursery say that it can not deliver the free childcare that he promise he call that a practical issue but i prefer the honesty of whichever of his colleague brief the times that it be and i quote a complete shit show interruption who be it who brief that to the times hand up will the prime minister finally realise 
 too long 
 order i will decide how long the question go on for for those who wish not to hear it i have tell you the answer and i will help you on the way 
 when will the prime minister finally realise that the big practical issue face britain be the constant farcical incompetence of the government he lead 
 another week with absolutely no idea for the country and absolutely no plan the right hon and learn gentleman talk about the cost of living and the economy but he never actually bring it up and we all know why because thing be improve and we be make progress wage be now rise debt be on track to be reduce and inflation have more than halve from to he know that our plan be work and that his £ tax grab will take britain back to square that be the choice it be back to square and high taxis with he or a plan that be deliver a bright future with the conservatives 
 change gear mr speaker too many oligarch and kleptocrat be live off ill get gain that   be beyond the reach of domestic court here   or in country such as america ever since the london anti corruption summit move to create an international anti corruption court have be gather momentum to plug the gap it already have support from country such as canada holland and   nigeria and it would fund itself from the fine it charge will the government take the lead in get it under way end impunity for those crook once and for all 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his work on this issue as i be sure he will appreciate establish a new bespoke institution be a significant endeavour but i know that he have discuss it with the foreign secretary who will look at the proposal in more detail in the meantime as he know our economic crime and corporate transparency act have a raft of new measure to crack down on dirty money and we will shortly publish our anti corruption strategy we will set out ambitious plan for combat corruption both here at home and internationally 
 i call the snp leader 
 last night as tory mp be once again fight among themselves the public be at home watch john irvine of itv news report on footage from gaza of an unarmed palestinian man walk under a white flag being shoot and kill by the israel defence forces such an act constitute a war crime do it not 
 we have be absolutely consistent that international humanitarian law should be respect and civilian should be protect i have make that point expressly to prime minister netanyahu and the foreign secretary be in the region this week make exactly the same point 
 i do not think it be unreasonable to expect the prime minister of the united kingdom to rise to that dispatch box and tell the people of these isle and elsewhere that shoot an unarmed man walk under a white flag be a war crime in recent week the house have act with urgency and intent follow an itv drama the question be will the house now show the same urgency and intent follow this itv news report and finally back a ceasefire in gaza 
 no want to see this conflict go on for a moment long than necessary we do want to see an immediate and sustained humanitarian pause to get more aid in and crucially the hostage out help to create the condition for a sustainable ceasefire i have set out the condition for that in the house the foreign secretary be in the region today and we will continue to press all our ally and partner to make sure that we can bring about that outcome 
 access to nhs dentistry be a key issue in ipswich and suffolk locally we have do something about it and the university of suffolk and the local nhs deserve great credit for establish a new dental centre that will carry out hour a year of nhs dental appointment however a source of great frustration for i and a number of constituent be that many people who train to be a dentist at university for year and have their training heavily subsidise can immediately go private or go abroad without give anything back to the nhs that seem wrong to i will the prime minister support the view of many of my constituent that those dentist   should work in the nhs for say year and give something back that would make a huge contribution to address the problem 
 my hon friend be a long stand campaigner for well dental access in his constituency i congratulate he on the new dental centre that be opening which i know he work hard to deliver i agree that it be right and fair that we seek well value for the significant investment that the taxpayer make in the education and training of the dental workforce that be why as our workforce plan outline we be explore whether a tie in would ensure that dentist spend a well proportion of their time in the nhs we will launch a consultation on that policy later this year 
 in the week of the anniversary of bloody sunday people in derry be watch unarmed palestinians be gun down by israeli soldier over people have now be slaughter in gaza the prime minister have say he have say it again today that he want to see a sustained ceasefire my question be a very simple the next time there be a vote at the un for a ceasefire will his representative vote for it 
 of course we will engage with all un resolution on their merit i have be clear that no want to see this conflict go on for a moment long than be necessary we want to see an immediate pause so that we can get aid in and hostage out because the situation be desperate for many people there but a sustainable permanent ceasefire need to fulfil a set of condition which include hamas release all the hostage hamas no long be in charge of gaza with the threat of rocket attack into israel and an agreement in place for the palestinian authority to return to gaza to provide governance and service the foreign secretary be in the region those be the principle on which we be work and i believe that those be share by all our major ally 
 in brunel open his rail bridge over the river tamar in i meet network rail and other to celebrate the agreement to build a simple footbridge over the railway line in lostwithiel that bridge still do not exist and i have no completion date can my right hon friend help 
 my hon friend be a long stand campaigner for the footbridge at lostwithiel station i recognise her concern and the press need for the construction of the footbridge i be tell that network rail be currently work on a funding solution so that it can take forward this important project in the next financial year the rail minister will keep my hon friend update on progress 
 a report release yesterday by the joseph rowntree foundation find that in people in the north east be live in poverty the child poverty rate for every local authority in the region be high than the uk average too many of our people be be hard hit the prime minister say that his plan be begin to work where do rise child poverty fit in his plan 
 in fact the plan be work because poverty be fall in our country there be few people in poverty than in include hundred of thousand of child of course there be more to do there be always more to do to make sure child do not grow up in poverty but that absolutely would not be help by labour ’s £ tax grab on their parent which would take money out of their family ’s bank account 
 bracknell forest be a place of aspiration opportunity and enterprise business occupancy rate and employment figure be thankfully high footfall at the lexicon shopping centre be up and wage be up but the cost of living continue to bite across the uk what more can be do to put more money in people ’s pocket 
 it be great to see thank to my hon friend that bracknell forest be thrive with people in work up and footfall in the town centre up and as he know almost of his school be now good or outstanding but he be right that we must do more to relieve the burden on work people which be why we cut taxis for ten of million of people in work early this year worth £ on average we have to stick to the plan for low taxis a strong economy and a bright future for the people of bracknell forest and absolutely not risk go back to square with the labour party 
 if everyone have the same good health as the least deprive of the population in england there would have be few death between and and few death in the year of covid those inequality be not inevitable do the prime minister think that cut in social security to low income household include people in low pay work in my constituency will help to address those health inequality 
 i can assure the hon lady that we be commit to care for society ’s most vulnerable and that be why almost family will see their benefit payment increase this april that will bring our total support over these few year to around £ per uk household the department for work and pensions be look very closely at how it can target its service precisely on the most vulnerable customer i know the hon lady speak to the dwp permanent secretary at length about that when he appear before the work and pensions committee early this month i can assure she that he will be write to the committee on exactly that subject shortly 
 the post office scandal have affect so many people include my constituent seema misra a sub postmaster from west byfleet who have an outstanding record of service to her community and who be wrongfully convict in of steal £ and sentence to prison on her son ’s birthday while pregnant with her son do the prime minister agree with i and more importantly with seema misra herself who be in the gallery today with her    husband davinder that she be due a full apology from the post office a full apology from fujitsu and proper compensation as a matter of urgency 
 i know that my hon friend have be a great support to his constituent over all these year and have fight relentlessly for the truth to come out as i have say the horizon scandal be of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation ’s history and as i say a few week ago we will introduce primary legislation within week to ensure that all conviction that be base on erroneous horizon evidence be quash that will clear people ’s name deliver justice and ensure swifter access to compensation innocent people such as my hon friend ’s constituent have wait far too long and i be determined that they receive compensation as swiftly as possible we have a clear moral duty to right these wrong and that be exactly what we will do 
 in food parcel be give out by bestwood bulwell foodbank last year that number explode to with nearly half of those parcel go to child the food bank be now have to buy food to supplement donation which can only be sustain for a short period rather than pretend that thing be get well will the prime minister apologise for the daily chaos in the government which be leave widespread destitution unaddresse 
 i do not want to see anyone reliant on food bank but while they be in place i have nothing but praise and thank for the people who run they however it be wrong to say we be not make progress when i come into this job inflation be run at which have have the single big impact on family cost of living now thank to the effort of this government most of they oppose by the hon gentleman ’s party inflation have be more than halve at and we be combine that with significant tax cut to put more money into people ’s bank account at the end of every month that be the right way to go about support people combine with our extensive cost of live support for the most vulnerable all the statistic show that that support have help and have make a difference and that be what you get with responsible management of the british economy 
 in november i hold an adjournment debate on the south fylde line and the need for a pass loop to double its hourly service and increase resilience against the delay and cancellation which again cause misery for traveller over christmas the assurance that i receive from the rail minister build on the positivity generate by the reallocation of hs2 fund since then progress have be desperately slow and my effort to advance this critical piece of infrastructure for the people of fylde have be frustrate will the prime minister meet i to discuss how the government can help to get the south fylde line back on track 
 my hon friend be correct local transport project be and must be prioritise and every region of our country will have more transport investment as a result of the decision that we make on hs2 work be under way to consider potential upgrade   to the west coast main line include improvement at preston station which may support additional local service from south fylde i know that the rail minister be consider these option carefully as we speak and will update my hon friend in due course 
 thames water be a shamble during the recent flooding in oxfordshire it dump sewage from site along the thames in week waste be back up into people ’s home because of drain that it have not unblock and it could not even refill its own reservoir because the river be too dirty rather than offer a rebate for this shoddy service thames water be intend to put bill up for everyone by will the prime minister explain to my constituent why they be be ask to foot the bill for thames water ’s gross incompetence 
 we have be clear that the volume of sewage discharge by water company be unacceptable and that be why we have launch the most ambitious storm overflow discharge reduction plan we have now achieve the monitoring of nearly every single storm overflow in england under this and previous government and introduce unlimited penalty on water company where there be evidence of poor performance the environment agency will not hesitate to pursue the water company concern just as it do i believe a couple of year ago in the hon lady ’s constituency when it specifically fin thames water £ follow a serious incident 
 yesterday   the right hon member for knowsley sir george howarth   and i publish our report on t1de type diabete and disorder eating a condition estimate to affect over a quarter of type diabetic in the uk it be life shortening life threaten and can lead to death i be pleased to say that hampshire integrate care board have already respond positively to the report will my right hon friend ensure that the government not only look seriously at the recommendation that we have put forward but act on those recommendation which would improve life save life and save money for the nhs 
 can i start by thank my right hon friend and indeed   the right hon member for knowsley sir george howarth for their important work on this issue i know that both speak from personal experience as my right hon friend say it be important that people get the treatment they need the health secretary will of course consider the report and the nhs have already be pilot service to support those with this condition as she will be aware i understand that the nhs be now also expand pilot site to every region of the country so that even more people can benefit from the appropriate integrate care 
 we enter with starvation and famine as acute as ever across the globe much of it cause by the climate crisis yet at present the world ’s bad hunger crisis be in gaza create by israel ’s ongoing siege the integrate food security phase classification have find that of the people face starvation globally   be in gaza starvation use as a weapon of war be a war crime the israeli government have the power   to end this starvation crisis by end the siege of   gaza and open all crossing do they not prime minister 
 i have be absolutely clear that we be incredibly concerned about the devastating impact of the situation in gaza on citizen that be why we have triple our humanitarian aid for this financial year to the region and as i say in the statement yesterday we be work with partner such as jordan and the united states to open up new aid corridor so that we can increase the supply of aid get to those who desperately need it 
 this morning the press report the tragic case of a year old girl who take her own life follow horrific social medium bullying include on tiktok and snapchat since across the english speak world there have be a marked increase in poor teen mental health teen suicide attempt and child addict to pornography the united kingdom have a strong tradition of legislate to protect child from serious threat to their safety and welfare so do my right hon friend agree that it be time to consider ban social medium and perhaps even smartphone for under-16 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the impact of what happen online on our child which be why our online safety act tackle criminal activity online and protect child from harmful or inappropriate content such as bully or the promotion of self harm and from access pornography and also from exposure to eat disorder ofcom be now rightly develop and consult on the guidance and the code of practice for how those platform will meet their duty and if they do not clean up their act ofcom will be able to impose fine of up to of global turnover on the social medium firm 
 recently release document reveal that the foreign office have serious concern about israel ’s compliance with international humanitarian law and its ongoing assault on gaza this assessment be hide from parliament while the prime minister boldly state his confidence in israel ’s respect for international law since then the scale of israel ’s war crime in gaza have be reveal to the world thank to south africa ’s case at the international court of justice therefore be it not now time for the prime minister to admit that he have the blood of thousand of innocent people on his hand and time for he to commit to demand an immediate ceasefire and an ending of the uk ’s arm trade with israel 
 that be the face of the change labour party 
 mr speaker may i start by thank you for commission the holocaust educational trust ’s exhibition in portcullis house and for your unwavering personal commitment to holocaust remembrance as we approach holocaust memorial day will the prime minister join i in commend the holocaust educational trust for its   important work particularly its work with holocaust survivor who despite live through the dark moment in human history continue to share their testimony in the hope of ensure never again in the face of the appalling rise in antisemitism that we see on the street of britain will my right hon friend join i in encourage all member to sign the book of commitment and stand up against antisemitism 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute to the holocaust educational trust for it brilliant work and i thank she for all her work on this issue i will be sign the book of commitment this afternoon during my meeting with lily ebert and i encourage member on both side of the house to do the same and to reaffirm our share determination to ensure that the holocaust be never forget and to defeat the resurgence of antisemitism and all form of hatred in our country 
 i represent a proud steel community in rotherham that stand with the steelworker in port talbot at this very worrying time my constituent do not want to see their   taxpayer money use to make british worker redundant our primary steelmaking capacity decimate and our national security compromise so will the prime minister change his destructive course start by look at the credible multi union plan to safeguard our steel industry ’s long term future 
 i know that this be an anxious time for steelworker in south wales but we be commit to work with the steel sector to secure a positive and sustainable future the hon lady will know that during the pandemic we provide support to celsa to safeguard job and ensure the sustainability of its steel plant in south wales the propose complete closure of the plant would have see the loss of direct job in south wales and thousand more across the supply chain because of the government ’s investment support and partnership with tata we have safeguard direct job and thousand more in the supply chain and we have ensure the long term sustainability of the steel plant so that it have a bright future obviously this be difficult but it be entirely churlish of the hon lady not to recognise of the large support package that any government have provide to any company safeguard thousand of job in the process 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state in the cabinet office if he will make a statement on the uk ’s resilience to recent extreme weather event include storm isha and storm jocelyn 
 i begin by say how sorry the government be to hear that people in this country and in ireland sadly lose their life due to storm isha i extend my sympathy to their family and friend at the same time i praise our emergency and utility worker who work so hard to help the public in very difficult condition 
 forecaster at the met office raise a rare whole country weather warn for the wind over the weekend in preparation for storm isha the warning encompass even rare amber and red warning for wind in the area forecast to experience the bad of the storm indeed wind gust reach a peak of mph in northumberland and mph across the cairngorms although the storm have the potential to be extremely destructive the vast majority of the transport and power infrastructure stand up well and recover quickly which be a credit to the resilience of our critical infrastructure and the response capability of our operational partner on the ground 
 storm isha be closely follow by storm jocelyn which reach a peak of mph i be inform that it be the name storm to impact our country this season again the impact of jocelyn in england be less than fear with operational partner work around the clock to clear any disruption on our transport and power network 
 there be no doubt that the forecasting capability of our expert at the met office and the accuracy and speed at which they can warn and inform the public of income severe weather event save life and protect our home and business 
 my official and those across government work hard last week and over the weekend to co ordinate the extensive preparation and mitigation measure that be take the fact that no escalation to a cobra level response be require for either storm be testament to our effective response structure at local and national level i be very grateful for the response from colleague in the devolved administrations and local resilience forum across the country our local authority and agency partner keep public service run and react to any local issue that emerge 
 we be adapt to weather event not previously experience in our country and event such as these come with increase frequency and severity the uk be drive forward cross government action to respond to climate risk and their impact on our economy and way of life our national adaptation programme publish in july last year set out an ambitious year programme of work drive by theme action information and co ordination 
 we be ensure a more integrated approach to climate adaptation over the next year through strong government engagement and co ordinated policymaking as part of that we have establish the right government   structure not only to monitor progress but to tackle strategic cross cutting challenge that will drive the uk ’s resilience to climate change this be all in line with the government ’s broad strategy as set out in the resilience framework which commit we to strengthen the link between our understanding of the risk that the uk face and the action we take to prevent those risk from materialise we must continue to drive forward these initiative which help we to curb the impact of climate change and at the same time build system that help we to withstand extreme event as they arise 
 i thank the minister for his response recent day have see the uk batter by severe storm storm isha and then storm jocelyn the name storm of this winter liz bentley chief executive of the royal meteorological society have say that these storm be 
 some of the bad in the last year 
 our constituent across the country have be hit by widespread damage flooding power outage and the cancellation of flight ferry and train in the most tragic circumstance people be report to have lose their life i want to pay tribute to the emergency service worker electrical engineer and other response team who have be work to help people restore power and get transport move often at risk to themselves in very severe condition we owe they all a debt of thank 
 of course minister can not control the weather indeed ex ministers on the conservative benches can not even control themselves but the great regularity and severity of extreme weather demand a response from the government let i therefore ask the minister give the frequency of extreme weather event why do the government not have a stand flood resilience taskforce as part of the cobra system with a specific responsibility for build up long term protection local resilience forum have be neglect since the passing of the civil contingencies act under the labour government what more can minister do to revive they and make sure they be properly support last week the public accounts committee say the flood protection budget put in place have be underuse since it be announce and be now expect to cover few property than be claim that leave more than home vulnerable to flooding what be the government ’s plan for they 
 jocelyn may be the late storm but it will not be the last the very least the public have a right to expect be that their government| understand that and be focus on the job and not on whatever be the late episode in the tory psychodrama that have distract the governance of the country for far too long 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his warm word about our emergency service and utility worker on his specific point about flooding he will have hear the department for environment food and rural affairs which be responsible for this area comment early in the week that flooding resilience in england be a priority for defra as part of a whole society approach to resilience outline in the uk government resilience framework for example the government be invest a record £ in the   flood and coastal erosion risk management capital programme since over £ have so far be invest in flood defence project across england with over property well protect 
 of course the response to flooding be just part of our resilience work that be co ordinated by the cabinet office mercifully very few family be flood out of their home in the storm we have just have but we be absolutely cognisant of the need to prepare i hope the right hon gentleman will have see the national audit office report publish late last year which note positively that since the government have 
 strengthen the arrangement to manage national risk 
 that they be 
 take step to address extreme weather risk as whole system risk 
 a point to which i will return in a moment and that they have acquire 
 good forecasting datum for drought heatwave and storm 
 over the past few year we have see a noticeable improvement in storm preparedness and response a few year ago there be still about people without power day after storm arwen the storm we have just have be very powerful and about people lose power to their home but of they have their power restore within hour as a result of the planning and preparedness that this government have put in place 
 we have learn the lesson we now have improve public warning we have harden infrastructure and crucially we forward deploy repair expert when we see storm form over the atlantic we signal to local partner in the utility and the emergency service and they go out and get ready on the ground do everything from clear storm drain to get ready to repair infrastructure that might be vulnerable 
 we have well public information the public be much more connected with the activity of storm name storm may seem like a superficial change but we know that be have improve public awareness of what be go on we have clear travel advice and the department for transport be do great work through our operator 
 we also have superior forecasting the government have invest a great deal in compute capacity and forecasting capacity that enable we to see where storm be come from well co ordination and deployment of resource from the centre mean that we be work well with partner on the ground and get a well response when extreme event take place 
 i thank the minister for his statement and i thank his official in the cabinet office who do so much that be often unseen on those with a high public profile will he join i in thank the environment agency emergency response team for the west midland the shropshire fire and rescue team who have do such a great job and all the official at severn trent water shropshire council and telford and wrekin council 
 the minister mention national infrastructure do he agree that highway fall under that will he call on highways england to do more to ensure that the m54 an important road in shropshire and in connect   wales and england have less flooding in future and to put in place more mitigation and investment to do that 
 i join my hon friend in his word of praise for those who have be work in the west midland i be sure that my dft colleague have hear what he say about the critical road in his constituency 
 it be a little bit cheeky of the government to take entire responsibility for the improvement for example sse have put improvement in place and do a huge amount of work for which it deserve credit so it be not just about the change to forecast i thank the resilience partnership that improve the emergency service the energy company and all the individual who step up to help other in their local community it be truly a community effort and people come together 
 i wish the government would take climate change more seriously give the incredible amount of extreme weather event we be see right now it be important for the government both to talk the talk and to walk the walk when it come to climate change they should be lead from the front in develop a strategy to help to ensure that we be resilient in the face of climate adaptation and the change that be happen and they should put the funding in place to ensure that that strategy can be deliver 
 the scottish government need funding to make the change require for resilience if there be massive geographical disparity in some of the weather event such as with storm arwen then barnett may not be the appropriate method to fund some of the require change in the upcoming budget process it might be sensible for the government to ensure that resilience funding be spread to the area that be most likely to be hard hit so that rather than scotland have a percentage share base on our population number that share be base on the likelihood of extreme climate event that would be most welcome particularly when it come to resilience 
 that be a classic question from the snp be n’t it the hon lady do not listen to what i have say and then ask for more money central government be absolutely not take all the credit for everything that have happen as she will have just hear i say it be our partnership with the people who work in the emergency service local government utility company and so on that have make the change possible 
 on climate change i be sure the hon lady will be pleased to discover that since peak co2 emission in the mid-1970 the uk government by their action have help to reduce co2 emission by more than which be more than any other g7 country we take these thing seriously and we will continue to do so 
 i thank both the minister for his statement and the government for their clear action to strengthen our nation ’s resilience as these extreme storm again unleash damage right across the uk will my hon friend join i in send our thought to the people whose home business and farm have be affect and in pay tribute to the environment agency staff emergency service local authority electricity company and volunteer group such as the appleby emergency   response group in my constituency which do so much to help people and community through the trauma and aftermath of storm and severe flood 
 i be very happy to join my hon friend in pay tribute to the appleby emergency response group so often it be local community organisation with their connection and awareness of and intelligence about what be take place on the ground that make a response possible so i be very happy to join he in that i be glad to hear that although his constituency be hit hard by the storm it have manage to move on quickly 
 my right hon friend   the member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden   ask why the government have neglect local resilience forum and indeed the civil contingencies act which they bypass during covid may i ask that question again what lesson have the government learn from covid and such issue in order to give great sustainability to the local resilience forum that need to protect we 
 we obviously learn a great many lesson from covid as the hon lady will be aware from the documentation that the government have publish over the past couple of year there have be a great deal of activity to improve our resilience and response to emergency my right hon friend the deputy prime minister give a statement to that effect in this house in december 
 the cabinet office assign ownership of acute national risk to lead government departments across risk identification risk assessment prevention resilience preparation and emergency response and recovery the lead government departments may change between the phase as the impact change and different competency be require none the less the uk have adopt a bottom up approach to manage emergency as most emergency affect local area we have local responder such as the police fire and ambulance service which manage emergency without direct involvement from the government the response to large scale emergency be then lead by lead government departments it be only in the most serious case that the response be escalate to cabinet office briefing room know as cobra and senior ministers from across government be bring in as the hon lady will have hear i say this be very much about a partnership between centre and locality and we be start to see the benefit of that approach 
 may i ask my hon friend to congratulate the good people of repton and the other village that come together to help with all the flooding that have be go on in particular they be hold follow up meeting to get more flood warden across south derbyshire i have never see anything like the flooding that have take place in south derbyshire we need to get the environment agency to move on with plan for instal hold pond far up the trent and the derwent to stop the run off from the field that we have have this time   round anything that my hon friend can do to help i to get spade in the ground on those project would be much appreciate 
 i very much hear what my hon friend say i know that my colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs will have hear likewise she will have hear what i have to say early about the department ’s position on flooding on alert for instance normal flood warning be operate we do not use the national alert because the situation do not reach that threshold and our local partner do not ask we to use it from what we can see at this stage that local system work well and help to protect people and where possible property 
 the consistent storm we have have this winter have mean that our community have feel more consistently batter by flooding and wind than ever before sadly as the minister mention life be lose at the weekend ten of thousand of house and business be leave without power transport link be halt in my edinburgh constituency there be no flight out of the airport no train be go anywhere and road and bridge be close thousand of home be flood yet the national audit office have warn that the government have not set a long term target for the level of flood resilience that they expect to achieve and there be no concrete plan to do so beyond that mean that any investment could be misplace and inefficient and that home will not be protect sufficiently do the minister see that this could be a lack of foresight will the government commit to reverse the current cut to flood protection and do more to ensure that investment be effective 
 the hon lady will have hear i reflect on what defra say early in the week about the £ of investment in flood and coastal erosion risk management through its capital programme and the fact that since the government have put £ into flood defence project across england 
 on the hon lady ’s point about the level of disruption we understand and sympathise with people who have be put in such situation although we can not control the weather we can by degree become well prepared for event both through the general resilience plan that the government have be do and by have well intelligence on storm form over the atlantic and make sure we have the right people with the right skill poise to act quickly when those storm strike that of course mean that we can minimise disruption to the public even though we can not eliminate it altogether 
 in my broxtowe constituency some business and home that i have visit have be affect by multiple storm and have receive the flood recovery grant but as it stand those who have be affect by storm babet and storm henk can claim after only of the flood be the government look to put more support in place for individual who have be flood multiple time by separate storm 
 my hon friend raise a very important question we know how awful it can be for family to be flood out of their home there be damage to their   property and effect and sometimes to item with sentimental value it be important that we have process and procedure in place to make sure that we can help people out in those circumstance on my hon friend ’s specific point i will make sure that he get a response from colleague in defra 
 in scottish question i speak of how caithness and north sutherland be completely cut off all the road be block during the storm so a pregnant mum whose contraction have start could not even begin her mile journey to raigmore in inverness to give birth people speak of the helicopter ambulance there be base in inverness but if that have to go to an emergency in lochaber on the other side of scotland what do the pregnant mum do to be quite honest we be face with a mum and her child die when the minister meet the scottish government will he please point out the utter folly of centralise these service in inverness when we have a perfectly good workable hospital in wick which should be upgrade and put into full use 
 i be happy to communicate that message strongly to the devolved administration i have visit caithness and see its remote beauty but yes can only imagine what it would be like to be a young woman give birth and cut off from major service i feel that the hon gentleman ’s plea for an upgrade at wick be very important 
 i thank my hon friend for his statement week ago runnymede and weybridge be flood as a result of storm henk when flooding happen locally my constituent must navigate a host of organisation with different responsibility include surrey fire and rescue service surrey county council runnymede borough council elmbridge borough council thames water affinity water the environment agency and surrey highways as part of my campaign to improve flood response and preparedness and protection from flooding i have be call for a local flood control centre to be a single co ordinated access point for accessible support and advice and clear and consistent communication will the minister meet i to discuss that 
 i be glad that my hon friend have such a worthy campaign to support his constituent i will ensure that his request for a meeting go to the most appropriate minister who may be able to advise he on how possible his proposal be 
 accord to the nao since plan be unveil in the environment agency have cut by its forecast of the number of additional property that will be well protect from flooding by in feltham and heston the level of water on our street during storm that be unable to drain away be get high and high i have to push the minister on this be he confident that his plan will be sufficient to keep home and business across the country safe from flood relate damage this be a huge and grow concern 
 the hon lady will have hear i say a moment ago that the nao be pleased that the government have take step to address extreme weather   as part of a whole system approach which can have real advantage when flood be come for example it enable appropriately train emergency worker to be send out to clear storm drain and ensure that anything that might make the flood bad be clear out of the way she will also have hear i say that defra have commit a great deal of money to improve flood defence over the past or year and that ten of thousand of home be well protect as a result we be not complacent and be always look at way we can improve that 
 i welcome the minister ’s statement and the excellent work by the team at the cabinet office who i know work extremely hard on these problem as he will know my constituency be home to some of our most precious chalk stream and winterbourne i be sure that he be aware that water level in the bourne valley and in village to the west of andover be perilously high he will understand the ecological importance of those river and the risk of the sewage system be overwhelmed and leak into the chalk stream the environment agency and southern water be do great work there be a huge pumping operation under way to avoid that calamity but far significant rainfall might overwhelm the entire system in his post match analysis once the weather calm down will he consider give special priority to identify work that be require in area of particular ecological sensitivity significant work have be do up and down my constituency over the past year by the flood resilience group southern water the ea and indeed riparian owner but more could still be do and it need a certain amount of concentration 
 i thank my right hon friend for his observation as a former resident of whitehall he understand the problem in great depth and the chalk stream of hampshire have no fine defender than his right honourable self he make a serious point about ecological sensitivity it be right that we pay attention not only to the immediate threat to life or property but to our natural environment as we know if we do not do so the damage can be irreparable and long lasting 
 barely a part of oxford west and abingdon be unaffected by the recent flood but abingdon remain unprotected in we be promise a plan which be cut because of a lack of resource for the ea it be not just the river thames it be also the run off from the new development where huge number of house have be build what be the cabinet office do to connect defra with the department for levelling up housing and communities so that the developer who have promise to clear the culvert can be force by the local authority to do so 
 as the hon lady will have hear i say early the cabinet office have a co ordinating role that bring together lead government departments and local responder it would be under that guise that different government departments would meet to discuss issue of the sort that she describe 
 even by the standard of what we be accustom to in the northern isle the last week have be exceptionally disruptive i associate myself with the previous expression   of gratitude to the road staff electricity engineer and other who have go about their job and to those who be respond even though it be not part of their job the response of farmer who just get on with clear the snow with a bucket on the front of their tractor have be phenomenal be this not a moment to pause and reflect that some of the change propose in other part of government could weaken our resilience the switch off of the copper wire network for telephone and the propose increase in the response time of the search and rescue helicopter provide by the coastguard from minute to minute will leave we in a bad position if they be allow to happen can the cabinet office do something to ensure that they be not 
 i have land at tingwall airport in a storm in the summer and that be frightening enough 
 you would not have do that last week 
 no can only imagine what it have feel like in the shetlands over the past week or so my sympathy be with the right hon gentleman ’s constituent to his point about general resilience the government be try to take a whole system approach to understand exactly how we can work with emergency responder and those who be responsible for our national infrastructure we be make progress but there be always area in which we can do more work 
 as both the minister and the shadow minister   the right hon member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden point out this be the late in a series of storm that we have face in october st andrews harbour be significantly damage as a result of the sea surge follow storm babet the harbour be run by a trust that date from when james vi of scotland grant the land to the people of the town but as a result of the community ownership fund that the government have run and other fund generally more and more of our asset be own and run by local community which when face with this kind of disaster have no source of funding to access support do the government agree that they should be look at ensure that funding be in place because st andrews be a work harbour that be face £ in cost without the repair be make there be a risk of other part of the town be affect in the future 
 i be pleased to have learn something about st andrews harbour i be sure that colleague in other government departments include dluhc be consider those issue community own asset can be a wonderful thing it be important that asset such as local port be govern by people who really understand the town and city in which they be base i be happy to take that forward 
 i thank the minister for his positive answer to the question farmer in my constituency tell i they can not recall flood and rain quite like this indeed they tell i the volume of rain have be of biblical proportion i hail from the coastal constituency of strangford where storm hit with a fury that be possibly not fully grasp the coastline defence around strangford loch and within my constituency have be subject to a level of onslaught never before see can the minister confirm what discussion he have have with the department in stormont to which westminster give substantial financial help to address coastal erosion perhaps the same level of assistance can be offer again 
 i will ask ministers from other departments to come back to the hon gentleman on the specific but he will know that we be very keen to see a restoration of stormont and i believe that the house will hear more about that very soon 
 somerset be so often batter by extreme flooding and in response the river cam flood warning system be be pilot in my constituency a stretch near north cadbury will be fit out tomorrow with laser depth measure device which will send real time message and alert to resident when the water level start to rise will the minister join i in congratulate liberal democrat councillor and somerset rivers authority for that initiative and agree that we need to fund more extreme weather resilience plan for isolated rural community 
 i be delighted to hear about the initiative in cadbury i have fond memory as a schoolboy of walk around the hillfort there and be well aware of the historical threat that somerset have face with flooding i be glad that in recent incidence local government and central government have be able to work together for the benefit of the people who live in that area 
 on a point of order sir roger an organisation in my constituency where i have ground to intervene on behalf of a previous pub tenant have issue its current tenant with a gagging order and verbally tell they not to contact their mp what can be do to protect my constituent from such bullying and to ensure that their constitutional right be respect 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order the ability of constituent to communicate with their member of parliament be constitutionally important i be very concerned about the matter he have raise constituent must be able to communicate freely with their member of parliament and i trust and hope that urgent action will be take to clarify that that be understand by all party in this case if the matter be not resolve satisfactorily i trust that the right hon gentleman will seek advice from the clerk of the journals in the instance about how this very important issue might be escalate

 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision about speed offence on road to which a mph limit apply to make provision about the enforcement of move traffic offence to require hour staffing of work on specify public road and for connected purpose 
 as i be sure you be aware mr deputy speaker life as a motorist have change significantly over the past decade car have become safe more efficient greener and quieter and yet despite the fact that the motor car be possibly of the great contributor to human wealth happiness and freedom it have become see by many as the root of all evil despite the enormous benefit that car bring to our constituent family up and down the land and indeed to people across the world for many motorist the world seem to be fill with councillor and official who be dedicate to make their life more difficult drive be become a minefield of potential trap and penalty such that driver be become paranoid and resentful about the entire system when that happen order tend to break down and the time have come for a rebalancing 
 in the bill i propose modest measure that would achieve a well balance and would hopefully see well result generally for motorist and member of our community across the board i propose that anybody catch speed between mph and mph do not receive penalty point rather they would be require to attend a speed awareness course repeat offence would require repeat attendance at speed awareness course i should declare an interest have be at a speed awareness course recently after i be catch unwittingly do mph on the embankment along with the archbishop of canterbury not at the same time or in the same vehicle but he be also do for a similar offence 
 the roll out of mph speed limit across the country have bring benefit in term of road safety but it have leave many thousand of driver disproportionately punish for stray over the limit the fact that driver can receive penalty point for do mph in a mph zone and for do mph in a mph zone seem unfair to many and be in danger of discredit the system in addition to penalty point and a fine driver so punish would also face high insurance premium at a time when premium be rise significantly in any event as it stand it be possible for someone to lose their drive licence by drive at mph time in year 
 year ago it be reveal that as mph zone be roll out across london transport for london be set a target of a speed fine a year with the met police that represent a huge increase in prosecution and the accumulation of point analysis of department for transport datum by claims.co.uk confirm that of those speed in a mph zone be exceed the limit by mph or more and only be drive above mph those number of course imply that of those catch speeding be do less than mph
