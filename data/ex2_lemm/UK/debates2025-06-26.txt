during the passage of the bus services no bill in the other place we commit to write to all local transport authority ask they to pause the installation of a specific kind of float bus stop where passenger get off the bus straight into a cycle lane or an island that be because they have be identify through research as problematic for people particularly those with vision issue we have already do work with active travel england and transport for london to identify a design standard fundamentally this government believe in accessible transport for everyone and that be exactly our ambition 
 i hesitate to interrupt what be a marvellous speech and a great testament to the hon gentleman ’s service but he mention the urgent request for vehicle that could withstand roadside bomb i think this might be an appropriate moment to mention that in response to that a new type of steel be develop in the uk ballistic steel which be invent at the university of cambridge develop at our steel research institute and produce in south wales that be a great national response and it demonstrate the importance of not only our steel industry but our industry in general in provide a rapid response to the requirement of those in the field 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to help ensure that the transport system support economic growth 
 what step she be take to help ensure that the transport system support economic growth 
 economic growth be this government ’s top priority and the chancellor put growth right at the heart of her spending review announce more than £ of capital investment in transport infrastructure to give people access to job and opportunity this include long term funding for our large city region billion of pound of investment in road hundred of million of pound for walk and cycling and deliver transformative project such as the trans pennine route upgrade and east west rail this will make a real difference to people ’s live up and down the country now and in the future show the difference a labour government make 
 every french city with a population of more than have a mass rapid transport system yet over uk city or town of that size still lack it research from centre for cities show that poor connectivity hold back growth and productivity by limit mobility a key reason why we have so few be cost because build a kilometre of track in the uk be twice as expensive as the european average can the secretary of state set out what her department be do to bring down cost and help kickstart a tram building revolution 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that matter with i in person a few day ago and for send i further information on the report and the research tram do have the potential to support growth at much low cost than heavy rail but he be right that the cost per kilometre of new tramline be much more expensive in the uk than elsewhere in   europe i have ask my official to look into what we can do in this area as we look to unlock growth across the uk 
 we have a proud community in st athan in the vale of glamorgan that be both grow and thrive thank to the economic opportunity provide by the bro tathan enterprise zone will the secretary of state work with welsh colleague to progress funding for a new railway station in st athan to support that growth and provide dignity for the resident 
 as we have see in so many area the previous government may have make promise about this station but they allocate no feasibility or development funding to get the project move through the spending review and infrastructure strategy this government will provide at least £ of rail enhancement over the next year to deliver long term infrastructure need in wales include new station detail of how this funding will be allocate will be announce in due course 
 my local economy on the isle of wight be entirely reliant on ferry service for the movement of people the delivery of product and in the case of tourism for customer will the minister acknowledge just how important unregulated ferry service be for the entire economic wellbeing of the isle of wight 
 i do recognise that issue the hon member and his colleague on the isle of wight have raise this matter with i previously and i be meet his colleague directly after this question time to talk far the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane host a meeting recently and we be consider what far we can do as a department to support local leader in find a satisfactory resolution for his constituent 
 a number of immediate airport expansion be now plan around the london area which be fair enough but there be some concern about the protection that be require for vital link to airport in the region and nation of the rest of the uk will the minister provide an assurance that work will be do to protect those link and the local economy that rely on they 
 the hon gentleman will know that we have invite heathrow to bring forward proposal for a runway and we be expect further information on that this summer we be clear that part of the expansion of heathrow be about improve regional connectivity he will also be aware that we have provide airport such as doncaster with government money to support that reopen 
 i call the shadow minister 
 to achieve growth business rely on our world class logistic and haulage sector give that logistics uk say that it be disappointed that the logistic sector have not be identify as of the foundational industry in the   industrial strategy this week what happen do the department for transport go into bat for our logistic sector do it lose the row or do it not bother what will the secretary of state be do to ensure that our logistic sector be see across government as foundational to any growth mission 
 it be my understanding that the logistic sector be pleased to be recognise as a case study in the industrial strategy i know that it welcome the announcement in the spending review of £ to progress the low thames crossing which be a key strategic freight route for many year the sector have be talk to we about improve the route from the south east to the midland and the north unlike the previous government this government be finally get on with the job we have take the planning decision to grant consent to the crossing and be make money available through the spending review to improve the country ’s critical freight route 
 the secretary of state clearly have not listen to logistics uk i hope that at least she know where the low thames crossing start and end let we turn to another foundational industry to transport and growth fuel elizabeth de jong chief executive of fuels industry uk say about this week ’s industrial strategy 
 we be disappoint not to be name explicitly as a foundational industry today give the vital role of the fuel sector in enable growth 
 why have our transport critical fuel sector also be leave behind by the government 
 this government ’s industrial strategy set out the sector that have the potential to deliver economic growth and for which be compete internationally for mobile capital investment my colleague the minister for the future of roads and i meet repeatedly with the industry be that to discuss fuel or freight and logistic we be determined to get our economy fire on all cylinder and we know what critical role the sector he talk about play in that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 my party and i be pleased when the chancellor recently announce funding for northern powerhouse rail to improve connectivity however we still do not know on what the money will be spend any plan to boost the northern powerhouse must surely include a new main line between manchester and liverpool a vital link that would not only drive economic growth across the north west but strengthen connection between of our great city when will we finally see the detail behind the chancellor ’s announcement and will she meet with i and my hon friend the members for cheadle mr morrison and for hazel grove lisa smart to discuss proposal for the well linking of manchester and liverpool 
 the mayor of greater manchester and liverpool andy burnham and steve rotheram have make a strong case for improve rail connectivity between their great city the hon member be right to say that this government be commit to improve the country ’s rail network i hope to say more on   scheme for the north in the week and month ahead i assure all hon member that i will come back to the house swiftly when i have more information so that they can question i far

 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 the government be kick start a revolution in bus service across the country deliver the right service in the right place at the right fare level to serve local community our bus services no bill will overhaul bus service operation protect vital route include in rural and deprived area and deliver on our commitment to improve living standard across the country the government have confirm over £ of funding for bus to support and improve service in and we be keep fare low by maintain the £ bus fare cap 
 it be no surprise that stoke on trent ’s bus service improvement plan be among the good in the country thank to funding from this labour government dozen of new service have be deliver such as the connect kidsgrove to hanley and meir and the help people get to wolstanton retail park will the minister join i in recognise the progress that stoke on trent have make with its bus network and will he meet i to discuss how we can ensure that progress continue when funding end next year 
 i congratulate stoke on trent on its success it be great to hear that local ambition be be realise through new bus service low fare and more accessible bus funding have be announce for stoke on trent city council be award £ and staffordshire county council be award £ future allocation for individual local authority will be confirm in due course 
 i be grateful to the more than resident who take part in my bus survey many express frustration about arriva ’s decision to cut the x5 service leave schoolchildren strand and people unable to get to work fortunately on this occasion   red eagle buses step in but what happen speak to the wide issue of bus company not put resident need will the minister join i in ask buckinghamshire council to take up the new franchising power in the bus services no bill to fix exactly that issue 
 the bus services no bill put the power over local bus service back in the hand of local leader right across england enable they to choose the bus model that work well for their area the government will support local transport authority that decide that the franchising route be the good option for they deliver improvement to service in their area i hope that my hon friend ’s local council will work with she and her constituent to find the good local solution 
 reliable and accessible local bus service be vital for our community connect people to work education healthcare and each other yet too often service be reduce or withdraw due to low usage leave many isolated to ensure that those service remain viable we must not only improve they but encourage more people to use they what step be the government take not only to improve local bus service but to commit to run national or regional campaign to boost bus usage and protect those essential route 
 we will encourage operator and local authority to work together to run their own regional campaign to help boost bus usage funding provide to local authority through the local authority bus grant to improve service could be use for that kind of campaign if those authority feel that will help they to meet their bus service improvement plan objective 
 after decade of fail bus deregulation under the tories i be pleased that this labour government truly understand the importance of deliver well bus service for million of people how will the government support local leader to take back control of their bus service and how will that benefit my constituency of harlow i be think particularly of rural area in my constituency such as roydon nazeing and hatfield broad oak where resident often talk about how a lack of connectivity cause issue of isolation and a lack of job prospect 
 the bus services no bill will put power over local bus service back in the hand of local leader it be intend to ensure that bus service reflect the need of the community that rely on they include in rural area leader in place such as harlow will be empower to deliver reform to their bus service we will also be reform bus funding give local leader more control and more flexibility to deliver their local transport priority 
 i welcome the extension of the £ fare cap and the new power enable local authority to deliver bus service that local resident need in my constituency of watford the recruitment of bus engineer to keep service run remain a major problem what be this labour government do to work coherently with the sector to meet that need 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s concern about the recruitment of engineer although it be of course primarily bus operator responsibility to ensure that they meet their staffing need the government will continue to support the bus sector to meet its current and future labour requirement the great long term funding certainty that the government be provide through the spending review confirm that the bus sector be a great for engineer to build their career in it be great to meet some of the rise star in the go ahead group just yesterday 
 my constituent in blaydon and consett rely heavily on bus thankfully with the support of the north east combine authority and our mayor kim mcguinness my constituent have benefit from subsidise fare as a result of the government ’s continuation of the bus service improvement plan funding for which i be very grateful that funding be due to expire in march but it be crucial that we be able to plan how bus user across the north east can continue to benefit from those fare will the minister agree to meet i and member of the combine authority to discuss how we can continue to provide value for money for bus user in the north east 
 i be delighted to hear that my hon friend ’s constituent be benefit from reduced fare below the government ’s national £ bus fare cap i be pleased that we be able to allocate £ to the north east combine authority under the leadership of mayor kim mcguinness i be of course more than happy to meet my hon friend 
 as i mention to the minister when he appear before the transport committee i send a transport survey to every household in weald of kent and receive hundred of comment about our bus many be dismay that village such as smarden egerton frittenden and pluckley now have no bus service at all while other observe that small village be serve by massive bus carry or passenger what further assessment have the minister make of the role of demand responsive service in rural area such as mine 
 the hon member will be aware that the bus services no bill contain power to ask local transport authority to identify specific route that be of social value and need that will be particularly important when consider rural area she will also be aware that the department have be support a number of design responsive transport scheme of which we be undertake review 
 in my constituency hammersmith bridge have be close to vehicle for over year during that time bus have be unable to cross emergency vehicle have experience delay and business on both side of the bridge have lose out the economic secretary to the treasury be recently unable to confirm on the radio whether the structure fund will be put towards the bridge ’s repair so will the minister tell i whether we can expect funding for hammersmith bridge to reopen 
 i entirely appreciate the problem that the hon member and her constituent have experience as a result of hammersmith bridge further information on the structure fund will be announce in due course 
 several of my constituent have write to i concern that arriva which provide local bus service have cancel or reduce some of their local route such as the in maple cross and the in south oxhey leave they with no other transport option aside from costly taxis what will the minister do to ensure that everyone have access to public transport such as those vital bus service 
 i will expect the hon gentleman to walk through the lobby with the government when our bus services no bill come forward it be exactly design to take back control of our bus service which the conservative party completely and spectacularly fail to do 
 the bill will empower local leader to choose a model that work well for their area it include as i mention a socially necessary local service measure local transport authority that operate under an enhanced partnership will be require to identify local service that they consider to be socially necessary and put in place requirement that must be follow before such service can be change or cancel they also need to consider the alternative option available to they 
 bus usage and service in rural and semi rural area such as wokingham be particularly hard hit during the pandemic will the minister confirm that council such as wokingham will not see funding for local bus service reduce and will he recognise that rebuild bus usage in rural area be a unique challenge that require extra resource 
 i completely understand the challenge particularly in rural area that be why the package of measure in the bill to give local area the power that they need to take control of those bus be so important i already mention socially necessary bus route in the budget we confirm £ in support to improve bus service and keep fare affordable include in rural area that funding have be devolve down to local leader to decide how to spend that in any way they see fit that will improve bus service in their area include in rural area 
 a blind resident in my constituency marilyn rely on her guide dog and the local bus network to live independently however change under the government ’s £ active travel grant include float bus stop on rifford road in my constituency force she to cross fast bidirectional cycle lane just to board a bus that go against safety advice from the guide dogs organisation and the royal national institute of blind people and be cause real distress do the secretary of state agree that government fund infrastructure must be safe and accessible for everyone and will she commit to review active travel guidance to consider the role of float bus stop that put blind and visually impair people at risk 
 during the passage of the bus services no bill in the other place we commit to write to all local transport authority ask they to pause the installation of a specific kind of float bus stop where passenger get off the bus straight into a cycle lane or an island that be because they have be identify through research as problematic for people particularly those with vision issues.[official report   july vol c. 8wc correction we have already do work with active travel england and transport for london to identify a design standard fundamentally this government believe in accessible transport for everyone and that be exactly our ambition 
 if we be to deliver local bus service we must deliver bus that be efficient and technologically modern to ensure we can meet those target with that in mind will the minister assure the house that any action take by government to provide bus and local bus service will support bus manufacturing across all part of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and in particular wrightbus in north antrim 
 absolutely and that be why i be so proud to chair the bus manufacturer expert panel in march that be a year long project with bus operator bus manufacturer and mayor across the country to try to forge a smooth pipeline of order to support our fantastic uk manufacturer 
 the government know that bus franchising be commercially risky and very expensive for any local authority we know that because transport for london cost taxpayer £ a year in subsidy and andy burnham ’s bee network in greater manchester be currently on course for an annual deficit of £ when its business plan be for a forecast profit what be the point of give risky franchising power to every local authority in the country when the government do not provide the money to support they 
 i will not take any lecture from the conservatives under whose watch we see few bus mile as i have explain to the hon gentleman in committee and in various exchange the full fat franchising as it be commonly know in greater manchester be only kind of franchising available to local authority various other method be available to different area include the model adopt in place such as jersey which be a partnership between the private operator and the local transport authority so that they can benefit from its skill and knowledge 
 i do not recognise and i have correct this in committee the figure that the hon gentleman quote for greater manchester which be perform fantastically deliver well more affordable greener smoother and reliable service for the people of manchester 
 i be grateful for that answer and we have hour of bill committee later today to rehearse the argument yet again in an early answer the minister say that he be provide £ of support for bus in this financial year but surely he know that £ go to help local authority navigate the huge administrative burden that come   with franchising and the other scheme that the government have in mind that leave just £ for actual bus service across the whole of england that be only enough to satisfy andy burnham for a year yet we have full fat be pursue by liverpool and west midlands i ask again where be the money to support those ambition 
 as the hon gentleman be aware place such as greater manchester be part of the group of authority that have receive £ to spend in their local area it be important to recognise the extraordinary performance of bus in greater manchester once again we be not tell local area which model to adopt for bus it could be franchise or enhanced partnership as well as remove the barrier to municipal bus company 
 what step she be take to help improve passenger rail performance in cumbria 
 what step she be take to improve passenger rail performance 
 i be all too aware that rail performance have be sub par for many year in this country but follow a decade of decline we be now start to see train performance stabilise with passenger return to the railway we be work with the rail industry on a performance restoration framework with clear focus area to recover performance include timetable resilience staffing and keep train safely move during disruptive event 
 the energy coast rail line in cumbria be in desperate need of upgrade it have victorian era signalling and part of the track suffer from coastal erosion upgrade the line would be of huge benefit to passenger improve the reliability and speed of journey and to critical freight for the nuclear decommissioning work and for the shipyard work at barrow business other member and i will meet the minister for rail next week to push for funding to get the final business case over the line will the secretary of state confirm that her department will work with i and other to ensure that the project be in the government ’s infrastructure pipeline when it be publish

 in blackpool be home to the busy railway station in the world a testament to our town ’s rich transport heritage today the blackpool south line urgently need a pass loop to enable train to pass each other and deliver the reliable frequent rail service that our community in south shore deserve the government ’s recent £ investment in blackpool ’s local bus service be welcome will the   minister meet i to discuss the long overdue need for investment in the blackpool south line to finally deliver that pass loop 
 this government be commit to invest in local transport around the uk i be pleased that we have be able to make such a substantial investment in bus service in my hon friend ’s constituency fylde council ’s business case find that there be potential to increase frequency on the south fylde line i know the rail minister would be happy to meet he to discuss the matter far 
 the lead question be on cumbria we be put general question into what be a lead question and i do not think it be good to join they up we be now go round the country on what should have be a cumbrian question which be something we could think about for the future 
 rail service be important in cumbria but they be also important in sleaford for some time i have be campaign for lift at sleaford railway station for those who have difficulty with stair i be pleased when the previous government include sleaford in the access for all scheme and have raise it at previous transport question i be delighted when the rail minister write to i to confirm that the feasibility study will go ahead when i meet network rail yesterday i find that it be stick network rail have do as much as it can but the money ready for it have not be officially unlocked could the secretary of state look into that and ensure that the work go ahead as soon as possible so that people can access the platform even if they have trouble with stair 
 i understand the importance of accessibility at rail station such as sleaford in the hon lady ’s constituency and she be right that feasibility work have be do on scheme across the country that feasibility work show that the cost of those individual scheme will vary from place to place we be review that work and look at the overall quantum of funding we have available i must say to she and other member of this house that it be unlikely that we will be able to fund all scheme but i will provide an update in due course on which one will go forward 
 much like cumbria my constituent and rail user in chichester share a part of the brighton mainline when commute into london unfortunately for they the journey time into london victoria on the rare occasion when everything be run on time be nearly minute which be above average for city of a similar distance from london the complaint i hear most often about the journey be the lack of a fast service will the secretary of state work with i to encourage southern rail to implement such a service for the benefit of my constituent 
 the hon lady will know that these matter be constantly keep under review we have constrain capacity on the rail network and need to balance the number of fast service we have with local stopping service but i be happy to discuss the matter far both with the train operate company and network rail 
 what step she be take to support the aviation sector 
 we be unlock growth through the power of aviation by progress airport planning decision and drive airspace modernisation include through the new uk airspace design service we have also invite proposal for a runway at heathrow which will have benefit across the uk and could result in billion of pound invest in our economy to help the sector grow in a sustainable way we have introduce the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and a bill for a saf revenue certainty mechanism 
 have the minister have discussion with the scottish government on how good to use the substantial increase in the scottish budget to support the aviation sector in particular what do the government plan to do to make up for the lack of investment in connectivity around glasgow international airport in my constituency 
 my hon friend be a champion for glasgow airport and as she know scotland need investment in transport and infrastructure of the kind we be now see across england and wales the scottish government will receive the large real term settlement since devolution begin in as a result of this month ’s spending review i hope this budget increase will be put to good use 
 it be good to see doncaster regional airport recently attract £ from this government the public service obligation flight route between newquay airport and gatwick be a vital regional connection between cornwall and the capital but with the current service end in july it be now up for renewal will the minister please meet i as a matter of urgency to ensure that this vital link remain in place 
 public service obligation be vital for connect the uk economy and i think we currently have i would be more than happy to meet the hon member to discuss the affect his constituency 
 whether she have have recent discussion with alexander dennis ltd on the potential impact of the propose closure of its falkirk and larbert bus manufacturing site on her target for public transport decarbonisation 
 what step she be take to support the bus manufacturing sector

 the £ for regional transport project over year that we announce early this month will help to create a pipeline of investment for the emission bus market in the uk while improve local transport for some of our large region as i say we be in close contact with all relevant party to consider how we can support alexander dennis 
 i declare an interest as co chair of the all party parliamentary group for british bus as the minister have outline this labour government will double real term transport spending in city region by the end of this parliament while this should be very good news for bus manufacturing in this country alexander dennis in my constituency and that of my hon friend   the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman be in a contradictory move seek to end more than a century of bus manufacturing in scotland and put worker in falkirk out of their job what action will the secretary of state and ministers in conjunction with cabinet colleague and the scottish government take to maintain strategically necessary bus manufacturing in falkirk

 i thank my hon friend for his steadfast advocacy for people and business in his constituency which i know have be blight by the collapse of the a226 at galley hill it be visit place such as galley hill that lead we to invest £ to enhance the road network and create a new structure fund that will repair rundown bridge decay flyover and wear out tunnel detail on how that fund will be allocate will be announce in due course 
 the minister be familiar with the campaign that i and neighbouring colleague have be run for many year to improve the a180 when will she have some good news for we 
 i can already give the hon member the good news about the £ allocate in the spending review for improve our nation ’s road and as he know national highways be look closely at what can be do on the road that lead to his constituency 
 peacehaven in my constituency be a grow town but it remain a road in road out town the daily gridlock and frequent roadwork on the a259 be the single big frustration and barrier to opportunity for my constituent will the minister meet i to discuss how we can unlock that and provide a real boost to peacehaven and neighbouring town 
 i appreciate how frustrating the situation be for my hon friend and his constituent my official be continue to discuss detail of the business case for the scheme with east sussex county council and i would of course be happy to meet he to discuss that far 
 the rapid transition alliance tell we that we can improve the quality of our road if we support more people to use rail as a form of public transport that be reason why i be campaign to restore the direct train between eastbourne and   london bridge that be discontinue during the pandemic will the minister back my campaign with a view to help to improve our road and improve economic growth for eastbourne too 
 that be a creative way of ask about railway in a question about road this government be commit to improve all form of transport so that people have a real choice about the good mode to use for their journey we be keen for people to have the choice of sustainable transport mode include rail walking and cycling as well as drive and travel on bus as the hon member will see the government be invest huge amount to support our rail industry just as we be do to support the state of our road 
 how much funding she plan to provide to increase the frequency of train from station in sutton and cheam constituency 
 rail service in sutton and cheam be support by requirement on train operator to plan service and timetable to meet current and future passenger demand ensure value for money for the taxpayer govia thameslink railway and south western railway be require to work collaboratively with the department for transport to develop future plan and our department hold they accountable for deliver for passenger 
 early this week i be contact by a long suffer commuter use worcester park station she write 
 as a teacher my day be already demand often fill with pressure high energy and very little downtime sadly commute to and from work now feel just as stressful train during peak hour be frequently so overcrowded that they feel unsafe and extremely uncomfortable what should be a straightforward journey have become an exhausting and frustrating part of my day 
 now that south western railway be under government control will the minister tell my constituent when we can expect to see the service and timetable finally improve for worcester park station 
 service return to public ownership be a watershed moment for our railway and the beginning of our effort to build great british railways a new publicly own organisation that run our train we want passenger to see improvement to their service now and start with swr each operator will have to meet rigorous bespoke performance standard on thing such as punctuality cancellation and passenger experience so that we can begin to build a world class public service 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 worcester park be a station that my hon friend   the member for sutton and cheam luke taylor   and i know well as it be on the boundary of both our constituency and i confirm that my constituent face the same issue of overcrowding swr acquire high capacity arterio train to address this issue back in yet year later only a handful   have enter service the uk taxpayer be currently spend over £ every month on lease the arterio fleet and over £ additionally every month to store the unused train will the minister confirm how many arterio train be now in use whether the issue delay roll out have now be address and whether he think that spend million of pound every month on unused train be a good use of taxpayer money 
 i be aware that another of those train be now in operation the new manage director be aware that this be a challenge and we be already begin to see progress

 the post covid backlog in drive test be trend down under the last government at the time of the general election it have get to which be still too high but it be come down since this government take over the number have rocket up to a new record high mean that constituent like oliver in my spelthorne constituency have have to wait month for a driving test the increase delay in drive test be put a handbrake on growth and productivity so whatever the government be do can they do more of it and fast please 
 we recognise that demand for drive test have grow not just because of a covid backlog but due to a long term change in behaviour and demand for drive test i be pleased to report that the change we have introduce particularly on overtime pay incentive be make a difference the dvsa expect to deliver thousand of additional test this month and be work to increase test availability far over the come year so that constituent like the hon gentleman ’s can obtain a test as soon as possible i understand how important this be particularly to young people and we do not want to curtail their life chance 
 rise 
 order i now have to move on to topical question there will be disappointment for hon member whose question be next on the order paper but that be because of the way question have be group we really do need to think about why we be group question that be not relevant to each other 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 early this month the chancellor ’s spending review make it clear that national renewal must be feel everywhere in every place and in every journey and that be what this government be deliver start with the big ever regional transport investment outside london over £ towards metro extension in newcastle and birmingham mass transit in west yorkshire and a new bus fleet in liverpool 
 but that be not all we be put billion towards the trans pennine route upgrade as well as east west rail and we be protect the £ bus fare cap until at least march today we be go far we be proud to announce that we be improve mobile connectivity in over rail tunnel and use satellite technology to strengthen wi fi on all mainline train to transform rail travel for passenger 
 finally last week i reveal our shocking hs2 inheritance make no mistake we will fix that appalling mess and get the project back on track our plan for change be under way with well journey for passenger and value for money for taxpayer 
 the transport sector generate britain ’s high emission through collaboration with france we have the opportunity to transform the world ’s busy ferry route across the strait of dover between britain and france into the world ’s high volume green shipping corridor will the minister commit to champion this great initiative in the uk and at the upcoming cop30 
 the hon lady be entirely right to highlight the importance of decarbonise our maritime industry and ensure that our port have the grid connection to enable fleet to purchase new vessel so that we can get carbon emission down on the sea as well as elsewhere in our economy i would be very happy to talk to she far about what more we can do to champion that important work 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 both grand central and hull train have see their passenger number increase dramatically since the pandemic by more than and respectively that be a significant increase compare with other operator why do the right hon lady think that might be 
 if the hon gentleman want to trade statistic on the rail network i can tell he that we have see a massive increase in passenger number on transpennine express and lner in fact last year we have a overall increase in passenger journey and passenger revenue overall go up from £ to £ which be good news for the taxpayer and a clear sign that people want to come back and use our railway 
 i be not hop to trade statistic i be hop that the right hon lady would answer the question i will provide the answer it be because they be open access operator they have to compete for passenger by provide a service that passenger want at a price they be prepared to pay and it be clearly work why have the government indicate to the industry that they be not supportive of open access by state their opposition to of the proposal submit in february 
 i have say repeatedly at this dispatch box that we see a role for open access operator when they open up new market and add value we have to balance that against the revenue that they abstract from the public sector operator we can not have a situation in which we import too much congestion on to the rail network because there be constrain and finite capacity i be keen to see a mixed model of delivery go forward but i need to reduce the taxpayer subsidy go into the rail network at the moment we be support 
 order

 everyone should be able to travel with dignity and ease which be why we launch the aviation accessibility task and finish group last year i expect to be able to provide an update soon when that group publish its finding as my hon friend have mention the civil aviation authority ’s airport accessibility performance report demonstrate that improvement be still require in some area 
 devon and torbay combine county authority will receive just £ between and in local transport grant funding less than half the amount award to york and north yorkshire and a fraction of the billion give to the city region despite devon have the long road network in the country a large local operator say that just £ a year would make a transformational change in devon where rural deprivation be well hidden will the minister meet i to discuss the issue face the bus network in devon and the government investment that be need

 i assure my hon friend that we be take this issue very seriously we be review licensing authority compliance with exist guidance and we will hold those who do not follow that guidance to account we will go far follow the publication of baroness casey ’s review and we have commit to take legislative action to close the loophole in the current licensing regime to achieve high standard of safety across the board 
 the dawlish sea wall collapse in cause a devastating loss to the south west ’s economy of about £ it be not the break in the sea wall that close the railway for week it be the collapse of the cliff will the minister prioritise the project to secure those cliff which be yet to be carry out or will she meet i perhaps she could even visit dawlish to see how important this fix be go to be 
 i know how important that rail line be to the people of the south west include the hon member ’s constituent we be work to determine which rail enhancement project will be take forward follow the chancellor ’s spending review statement on   june more information will be make available shortly and i be sure that my colleague the rail minister will write to the hon member in due course 
 follow the question ask by my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson last week the casey review show we yet again that private hire vehicle be a dangerous place for many child and young people nationally in of taxi licence be issue in local authority wolverhampton of my neighbouring local authority yet only of the applicant live there what action be the minister go to take to ensure local taxi licensing be do locally and to high standard 
 hear hear 
 baroness casey have rightly bring this issue into sharp focus and as i say to my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson we be commit to address it we will work as quickly as possible and consider all option include out of area working national standard and enforcement in seek the good overall outcome for passenger safety 
 the minister may be aware that the outline business case for improvement to the a31 at hickley ’s corner in farnham    will come before she in a couple of month time while i understand that she can not make any promise now will she at least agree to look kindly on that application and meet i to discuss it

 i thank the chair of the select committee for that question i be study the appg ’s report in detail illegal e bike be clearly dangerous and have no place on our road i would be happy to meet she to discuss it far 
 my constituent paul cycle more than km a month all across the country but he tell i that cheshire ’s road be among the bad poor road be dangerous for all road user so do the minister agree that national guidance for pothole repair policy must properly reflect the need of cyclist alongside motorist we must urgently improve road condition for everyone 
 i absolutely agree that the poor state of the road that have be leave to we after year of under investment pose a serious risk to cyclist that be precisely why we have give that extra £ to council across england and it be precisely why we be hold they to account and ask they to follow good practice in road maintenance 
 as the secretary of state know i welcome the £ be invest in welsh rail over the next year but will she help i to secure a meeting with the rail minister so that we can discuss the need to start off build the burns station with the magor and undy station in monmouthshire

 i be afraid to say that the past week have be another horror show for the government this be armed forces week as the house will know it be a time to celebrate and champion all those who serve and have serve in our armed force and nowhere more than in my own county of herefordshire we must also note that far from celebrate the armed force this government deliberately open the door last year to unfair and vexatious prosecution of veteran who serve decade ago in northern ireland and they have keep that door open 
 what else the original abortion act be debate for more than a year but the government allow no notice for public debate on the abortion amendment last week and they give just hour of debate in the chamber on the big change in abortion law in nearly year whatever think of the merit of the issue that be a scandalously bad way to make legislation 
 what else defence ministers be leave out of the loop on the us bombing of iran ’s nuclear facility and be unable to say whether they support this action by our close ally a government whip resign express her deep concern over the welfare bill and the government have promise to bring the bill forward next week as we have just hear let we see if they do 
 talk of u turn the government have only just u turn on the winter fuel payment and again on groom gang last week have prepare themselves for a u turn on the child benefit cap less than a year since they suspend labour mp for vote against the cap 
 this be just week be it any wonder that the prime minister ’s personal reputation have continue to plummet only yesterday the times of london say 
 not quite a year have pass since his landslide general election victory and already his political stock be trade at junk status akin to a zimbabwean dollar or weimar papiermark 
 mr speaker you may recall from your intimate knowledge of german history that the papiermark be a monetary instrument that lead to hyper inflation and political collapse that be come from the times of london 
 shall we dig a little bit far into specific reason why the prime minister ’s reputation might have fall so much follow the record pay settlement of last year the junior doctor have announce that they be excited at the idea of month of strike action meanwhile hospital consultant be ballot to see if they will strike as well doctor receive a increase last year after labour take office and now the junior doctor be apparently demand a further pay increase of these be eye water number and of course we will all end up pay if the increase be grant but i be afraid this be exactly what we would expect from a government who have tax and splurge the cash since the election 
 it be hardly surprising that the union now think they have an open door to extract money from the treasury and the government have actually make the situation even bad through their rolling programme of nationalisation and by abolish nhs england whatever else it may have be nhs england act as a firebreak on union lobbying because it operate semi independently of minister by abolish it the government have now remove of the few mean they have to face down extortionate demand for more pay and more restrictive practice 
 the same be true with the railway as each be nationalise include south west railway only last week so the obstacle to the union demand be progressively be remove the house will recall the massive pay settlement give to the rail union last year with no attempt to negotiate any efficiency gain it be only a matter of time before those union come back for more as the doctor be do these be not pay bargain they be an abject surrender of course ministers themselves do not mind after all of they be report to be union member as far as i can see the leader of the house be an exception she be not a union member and all credit to she for that 
 i be 
 ah okay i be very sorry to say that the leader of the house have correct i she be in fact a union member and therefore fully complicit in the same problem 
 the treasury itself be now the only hold out against union demand little wonder the chancellor have look so unhappy and out of sort and that be before the deputy prime minister start leak memo call for billion of pound a year in tax increase the union know the government be vulnerable and they have   come back for more labour back benchers also know that the government be run scared and lead by their select committee chairs they be start to get organise can the leader of the house positively and personally now confirm that the welfare bill vote will take place next tuesday 
 may i start by wish deputy speakers a happy birthday hon member hear hear 
 as the right hon gentleman say this be armed forces week when we thank and show our support for the man and woman who serve or who have serve in our armed force over many year it be nice to see the right hon gentleman in his place again this week because we have miss he quite a bit recently but i might gently suggest that if he have be here last week he could have ask last week ’s question last week instead of ask they this week 
 he ask i about the welfare bill as i have just announce to the house the reading of the universal credit and personal independence payment bill will take place next tuesday and the remain stage of the bill will take place on the floor of the house the follow week i want to reassure colleague that we take parliamentary scrutiny and the process of bills extremely seriously that be what our parliamentary democracy be all about bill be introduce principle be consider at reading and the detail receive robust debate and discussion and be often amend in committee before we consider reading as the house would expect the government actively engage with parliamentary opinion throughout a bill ’s passage as we be do intensively with the universal credit and personal independence payment bill 
 i be sure that the whole house can agree that our welfare system need reform too many people be consign to benefit for life without support to work and to get on during the pandemic in particular the number of those on sickness and disability benefit rise significantly and the previous government do nothing to re engage people with the labour market afterwards in young people be now not earn or learn many post industrial community have be scar over generation by worklessness and little job creation as constituency mp we have all see the inadequate and frankly degrade nature of disability benefit reassessment 
 address these deep seat problem be at the core of our labour principle and what we be try to do with our welfare reform i just remind colleague that these include the big permanent increase to the standard out of work benefit since an end to reassessment for all those with serious health condition create a more holistic and professionally lead assessment process the big back to work programme in a generation the right to try work and end the era of consign people as unable to work 
 to be clear it be the conservative legacy that this government now have to sort out their legacy of in working age people on sickness or disability benefit their legacy of a generation of young people with no mental health support and poor skill their legacy of over people on nhs waiting list and their legacy of inaction on welfare reform over year and   year quite honestly the right hon gentleman have a brass neck because the conservatives have write the book on government chaos have they not there be prime ministers in year they send the market into chaos with budgets do on the back of a fag packet they really do write the book on that there be by election after by election for misconduct over ministers resign in a single day billion be waste on crony covid contract public service be leave on their knee and industrial action be sweep the country cost we all dear all of that leave ordinary people pay the price with high bill high mortgage and long waiting list 
 however this be not just about welfare reform it be also about the context in which this sit in and that be what this government be get on with do this government ’s mission to create good decent well pay job in every community this government ’s mission to bring down waiting list and deal with the deep seat health inequality in this country this government ’s mission to tackle child poverty this government ’s mission to build more affordable and social housing give people a bedrock in life and this government ’s mission to revolutionise skill and opportunity for young people that be this labour government with our labour value get on with the job and deliver for people 
 rise 
 order i be go to allow business question to run only until am because of the important statement that be to follow so i ask members to help each other and there will be a good example from afzal khan 
 i know that many colleague in the house share my frustration with the leasehold and management company that leverage excessive and ambiguous service charge on leaseholder and tenant in my constituency i be face ongoing problem with glide property management which demand unreasonably large sum from constituent without provide suitable service and which be refuse to respond to the numerous complaint that have subsequently be submit to it do the leader of the house agree that such company should not continue take advantage of leaseholder and tenant and must be hold fully accountable for all complaint 
 i fully share my hon friend ’s frustration with our leasehold system and the charge and difficulty that many leaseholder face he will know that we be act quickly to implement the provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act and there be more come on that very soon include the measure to drive up the transparency of service charge and ensure that they can be challenge more easily by leaseholder 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i join the leader of the house in congratulate the deputy speakers on their birthday and in celebrate our armed force 
 early this year when the secretary of state for work and pensions announce the welfare reform her argument to this house be that they be all about get people back into work that argument be   undermine somewhat by the timing in the spring statement the follow week we discover that the £ saving we achieve from the welfare reform make up fully half of the fiscal headroom that the chancellor be rely on when we take a close look at the reform we find that most of the saving be generate by change to the eligibility criterion for the personal independence payment entitlement to pip be give to those in work those out of work and those unable to work it follow that many of those who stand to lose out as a result of the reform will not be incentivise into work because they will already be in work or will be unable to join the workforce any time soon no wonder then that when the bill be publish last week there be condemnation from all side of the house if the book need to be balance we need to make sure that they be not balance on the back of the disabled 
 the leader of the house will be well aware of all the rumour circulate around this place that the government be prepare to make concession on the universal credit and personal independence payment bill what be the procedure for do that we understand that a reasoned amendment if be table would kill the bill off entirely what be the option for the government to make concession will they have to withdraw the bill and re present it or be there some other mechanism by which they can make compromise with their back benchers before next week 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place he have do a very good job of stand in for his excellent colleague   the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman with whom i also enjoy work 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that reform to the welfare system have to be do with compassion and be carefully manage i be sure he also agree that the system do need reform he be absolutely right that pip be not an out of work benefit but a benefit that help to support disabled people with their living need we have to ensure that it be sustainable for the long term and be there for those who need it most as i have say we be listen closely to colleague from across the house include i be sure member from his party who have a lot of experience of deal with the pip assessment process i be sure we all recognise that for too long it have be a box tick degrading process that have not be fit for purpose that be why we have be review it and listen closely to colleague we want to get this right for disabled people their carer and other 
 the hon gentleman ask about the parliamentary process as leader of the house with responsibility for legislation across the piece i struggle to think of many government bills bring in this session that have not be amend during their passage most bills be amend and those amendment be usually make in committee and on report i be sure that this bill will be consider in the usual way during its parliamentary passage 
 the leader of the house extol the virtue of parliamentary democracy yet over half of mp reject the universal credit and personal independence payment bill we have speak to our constituent and to organisation represent disabled people they reject the bill because it will cause harm to disabled people their voice have   not be hear much though we be try to amplify they in this place will the leader of the house urge the cabinet to withdraw the bill and instead allow a general debate on how we support disabled people 
 my hon friend have campaign on these issue for a long time we have not yet vote on or even consider the bill we will have an extensive and i be sure thorough parliamentary process in which to do that i ask colleague to think about the principle of welfare reform on reading and to then really drill down into the detail of the bill as it pass through parliament we have engage with the disabled community we will continue to engage with colleague from across the house and with stakeholder as we consider not just this bill but the further welfare reform that be need which have to be as i say compassionate and consider so that we have a system that be there for the long term for those who need it most

 the right hon lady be right to raise the issue of dental desert which we see across the country not just in wales she will know that the previous government do not invest in dentistry and that have have a knock on effect in wales many colleague have raise with i the need for more dental school i suggest that she club together with some colleague to get a debate on that subject

 the late datum from the environment agency show nearly report of waste crime across england in the past year with the west midland sadly show the high concentration of incident waste crime cost the uk   economy around £ annually and no doubt the labour lead birmingham bin strike be not help can we have a debate in government time on the problem of waste crime and the need to take action to tackle both waste crime and the bin strike which have be go on for over day 
 the right hon lady be right that fly tipping and waste can blight community and be a real problem though i must say that incident sky rocket and prosecution fall under the previous government that be why we be take step through the crime and policing bill to give police and local authority more power to take off road vehicle off the street and to take tough action on fly tipper 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my support from trade union this week we have hear extremely disturbing news that northumbria police have destroy all document relate to the miner strike include on orgreave that be absolutely alarming the labour government have pledge an inquiry or investigation into the strike yet the wanton destruction of that vital critical evidence have be allow to happen be this a sinister attempt to obscure justice i be not sure that anybody be prepared to answer that question who give the police permission to destroy these document and what be behind it can we have an urgent debate into how the government can instruct all police force and all authority everyone that hold any detail on the miner strike and orgreave to retain that evidence for when the labour government maintain their pledge and hold an inquiry into the event of justice can not be serve if evidence be systematically and deliberately destroy 
 that sound like a deeply worrying development in the case and i be sure the whole house will be shock to hear it my hon friend have long campaign for justice and answer to what happen at orgreave year ago he raise the issue with i last week and i will continue to raise it with ministers on his behalf i join he in tell anyone involve that they must retain their record and when question be ask they must come forward with every bit of information they have on what happen as they would be expect to

 obviously i can not comment on specific case but this sound truly shocking clause of the border security asylum and immigration bill will give the home secretary power to refuse refugee status to those convict of any sexual offence even when it do not result in a prison sentence of month or more we be determined to ensure that those who commit such crime do not get the right to stay in this country 
 brilliant organisation such as citizenaid which be co found by of my former boss major general tim hodgetts and professor sir keith porter provide brilliant education about civil resilience and emergency preparedness in an increasingly uncertain world will the leader of the house commit to government time for a debate on that really important issue so that we be upskille our citizen in case of serious incident
