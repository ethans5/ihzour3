it be a pleasure to follow my constituency neighbour   the hon member for read central matt rodda i can confirm that reading be an excellent place to do shopping it be a vibrant city with excellent restaurant and an important regional hospital i be disappointed that the hospital will not be rebuild until the 2040s but we will like all constituency mp who circle the royal berkshire hospital continue to advocate for it 
 it have be a pleasure to represent over the past year my constituent of henley and thame it have be pleasing to back some local campaign but also to learn some of the national significance that those campaign have and i would like to speak to of they in my hometown of henley i have be campaign to get marsh lock horse bridge reopen since it close over year ago there have be a record of inaction and when i become the mp i immediately write to ministers the environment agency thames path national trail and many other organisation basically anyone who would listen i be pleased that that work have make progress in do that work i have discover a lot more about the state of our infrastructure on our river that is lock weir and bridge we all know the state of infrastructure when it come to education health and our road but less know be the poor state of our lock weir and bridge they be essential infrastructure for river navigation and safety on the river and if we do not have they my hometown of henley pretty much would not exist and would not have a river run through it or at least there would not be any water in it i would like to highlight that situation and call on ministers to continue look at how additional funding can be raise for the environment agency and its vital work there 
 the campaign i have be focus on be the thame to haddenham greenway thame and the village of haddenham be just mile apart haddenham have the train station and thame be the major town with shop school and many facility 
 the be not connect by an off road greenway capable of take active travel i have be campaign alongside resident to get that go that be why i introduce an amendment on compulsory purchase order to the planning and infrastructure bill 
 as we know compulsory purchase order be readily use for road project but they be difficult to use for active travel project that be why i call for government guidance on that unfortunately my amendment be not successful but i be pleased that active travel england will bring forward guidance include case study on how other council have successfully use cpo i be grateful to the government for push that forward a cycleway between goring and wallingford would also benefit my community again i hope that the government will continue to invest in active travel 
 i will touch briefly on another issue that i have be campaign on the lack of adhd service in oxfordshire with no adult service commission for annual review by a specialist once someone with adhd who be well control on medication reach the year limit as require by national institute for health and care excellence guideline gps be remove prescription from they that be an absolutely scandalous and very   dangerous situation for people with adhd i urge the government to move quickly in their task of implement the recommendation of the forthcoming taskforce publication to ensure that we be properly treat and look after people with adhd 
 in my remain time i will mention some of the excellent organisation that i have have the pleasure of meeting include the men ’s shed in peppard the sharing life trust in thame which do excellent work as a food bank the river tame conservation trust the riverside counselling service and the henley ymca like many time mp who spend their summer recruiting officer and do a lot of admin i be very much look forward to this recess as i be sure all member be but rest assure that i and my lib dem colleague will be back in september to continue hold the government and the official opposition to account and i look forward 
 would it be so my constituent scott young a year old father to be from beverley be leave permanently blind in eye after nhs failure include a month delay to urgent surgery follow a diabetic haemorrhage which the trust now blame on admin mistake when the same issue threaten his remain sight identical delay occur until i intervene yet the hull university teaching hospital nhs trust response contain factual error include claim that a heart condition delay surgery even though it have not be diagnose when the delay occur do the minister agree that such failing demand accountability and what step can he take to improve the administrative process within our hospital 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help reduce waiting time at a&e department 
 what step he be take to help reduce waiting time at a&e department 
 this government inherit an intolerable situation in a&e where over a decade of tory failure leave patient wait in pain we be do the hard work need to start repair that damage our new urgent and emergency care plan be back by nearly £ which will mean few a&e patient wait more than hour this year new urgent treatment centre mental health crisis centre and almost replacement ambulance those be just some of the step that we be take to rebuild our national health service 
 i welcome the progress this uk labour government have make in reduce a&e wait in england that sadly contrast with a crisis in scotland where recent figure reveal scot wait over hour to be see jackie baillie rightly warn that 
 life be be put at risk 
 under the snp and it have be year since the scottish government last meet any of their target do the secretary of state agree that only labour in westminster and in holyrood have a serious plan to back nhs staff and cut waiting time 
 i agree with my hon friend there be no sign of the snp members this morning they have obviously clock off for the summer or maybe they be just spar their blush because the party have be in power for close to decade in scotland and have be steadily drive the nhs into the ground the chair of bma scotland have say 
 the nhs be die before our eye 
 with the snp it be on its nhs recovery plan in less than year scotland need a new direction with a scottish labour government work in partnership we will fix the nhs across the united kingdom and make it fit for the future 
 of my visit after be elect last year be to the a&e department at the william harvey hospital in my constituency where patient be be treat in the corridor and other face long wait for treatment i therefore welcome the progress that have be make so far on reduce a&e waiting time however too many people end up at a&es like the at the william harvey because they have no other option what be the government do to increase care option in local community include the use of virtual ward to ensure that more people be treat close to home and that patient in a&e be those in an emergency 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be unacceptable that corridor care become the norm under the conservatives we will not accept it as normal it be not acceptable ahead of this winter we will require local nhs system to develop and test plan to significantly increase the number of people receive urgent care service outside hospital include more paramedic lead care in the community more patient see by urgent community response team and well use of virtual ward together we will improve our emergency service and make sure that people get the right care in the right place and at the right time 
 the government have speak passionately about how minor injury unit such as the at mount vernon hospital in my constituency help to take the pressure off a&e by divert less urgent case for treatment elsewhere i be grateful to the secretary of state for his time for a brief discussion about that last week will he now respond to the local people and my constituency neighbour include   the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell who be join my campaign to save the minor injury unit will he intervene with the hillingdon hospital nhs foundation trust to prevent the unit ’s closure 
 configuration of service be a matter for local commissioner however let i take this opportunity to reassure the hon gentleman that i have take into account representation receive from my right hon friend   the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell as well as his letter i apologise to he for the delay in response but i assure he that he will get 
 in june just of patient admit to woking ’s local a&e at st peter ’s hospital be see within hour that be way below both the national target and the national average of will the secretary of state agree to investigate that to find out why my constituent of woking be face such lengthy and unreasonable waiting time 
 as the hon gentleman know urgent and emergency care service have be struggle right across the country but he be right to identify where there be serious and significant variation in performance of the focus of this government be to try to reduce unwarranted variation from nhs provider to another so that we get consistently good standard of care across the country i commit to write to he to far explain why there be particular challenge in his area and what we can do together to help resolve they 
 i call the shadow minister 
 respiratory syncytial virus rsv be a common reason for attendance at a&e and admission to hospital among old people and i have raise this repeatedly last week the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation recommend that the rsv vaccine programme should be extend to the over-80s and those live in adult residential care home can the minister confirm that these vaccine will be available in time for this winter season 
 i can certainly reassure the shadow minister on this the minister for public health have already accept that recommendation and be work at pace on implementation may i wish the hon lady well in the opposition reshuffle 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the year health plan for england on perinatal mental health 
 the year health plan set out ambitious plan to boost mental health support across the country include for woman during the perinatal period during the year to april a record woman access maternal mental health service or specialist community perinatal mental health service such as those at the whiteleaf centre in aylesbury the department for education be also invest £ to roll out good start family hub to all local authority in england which will also support new mum 
 i be really grateful to the minister for her answer and for her focus on this i would like to ask about midwife who do incredible work support parent and baby include identify and support woman who be face mental health challenge we desperately need more of they yet the royal college of midwives have find that out of student midwife who be due to qualify this year be not confident that they will find job what step be the minister take to ensure that newly qualified midwife be able to find work 
 i recognise my hon friend ’s great work in this place to support woman on this issue we recognise that newly qualified midwife be experience challenge in gain that role that be partly due to the record number of midwife in post and to well retention rate nhs england be work with employer university and regional midwifery lead to help midwife find those role after qualification and to transition into workforce and we will keep a close eye on that with they 
 in assess the impact of the year plan on perinatal health for england can the minister assure we that the lesson learn will be share across the rest of the united kingdom to enhance care quality and reduce regional disparity especially in northern ireland 
 the hon gentleman make an excellent point about the important need to share the learning across the united kingdom and i will make sure that we do indeed make effort to do that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 over the weekend the guardian report that the number of woman die in the perinatal period have rise sharply since family that have be fail and health professional feel that whether it be perinatal depression or unsafe birth lesson be not be learn and the same error be repeat in review after review alongside the inquiry that the secretary of state have launch will the government immediately implement every action from the ockenden review and put an end to this national scandal in maternity service

 the hon member be clearly a doughty campaigner i be sure that will mean something good will happen for he in the reshuffle that we be all watch with bated breath i be happy to have that discussion with he as i say the neighbourhood health process will be drive primarily by identify area where healthy life expectancy be low and deprivation be high clearly he make a case for his area and i would be happy to have that discussion with he 
 the question be on long crendon so we will see how josh fenton glynn do 
 before i start i pay tribute to the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar who face his last set of health question he be an incredibly kind man we speak after the loss of my brother and a fantastic shadow secretary of state i be not sure how they will replace he 
 of the key shift we need to see in the year plan be from hospital to the community key to keep people out of hospital be tackle the dental desert with dental problem be the big cause of child age to go to a&e. will the minister assure i that the new neighbourhood health centre will include dentistry 
 order that be not link to the question that be why i be really bother when i call the hon gentleman

 eat disorder cost the uk an estimate £ each year yet research into these serious condition receive just of all mental health research funding that be despite eat disorder affect around of people with mental health condition the consequence of which be delay diagnosis and treatment and often lengthy hospital admission will the minister agree to meet i and the eat disorder charity beat to discuss how the government can break this cycle and ensure that eat disorder research receive the attention and investment that it urgently need 
 i know that this subject be close to my hon friend ’s heart and i pay tribute to he for his work on it we recognise the devastating impact that an eat disorder can have and the early the treatment be provide the great the chance of recovery the department continue to work closely with nhs england which be now refresh guidance on child and young people ’s eat disorder i commend the work of beat and i would be happy to discuss this far with my hon friend 
 the eat disorder issue be escalate as the minister rightly point out will he agree to hold discussion and consultation with the devolved structure in northern   ireland scotland and wales so this issue go to the top of the list of issue that have not really be deal with in the past but need deal with now 
 we remain in close contact with all our colleague in all the devolved administration i will certainly be follow up with official as we develop the research programme that we be work on and as we integrate eat disorder into the broad work we be do around mental health get more mental health worker and create young futures hub and mental health crisis centre be just some of the work that this government be do on this important issue

 block bed cost pembury hospital £ every night yet discharge team have to manually phone care home to place people there my constituent debbie have create a dashboard it be basically like skyscanner to accelerate discharge by match discharge patient to care bed it have already receive seed funding of £ from kent county council and could save up to £ a year in pembury alone will the minister meet i and debbie to discuss that idea 
 the hon gentleman highlight the serious problem of staff operate in an analogue age in the nhs which we keenly highlight in the year plan we want to move the system into a more digital age we would be very happy to hear more about the scheme that he outline and the great work that staff be do to get over some of the problem that they be work with 
 my constituent lee armstrong contact when he be suffer from an addisonian crisis lee and his partner provide full detail about his condition to and when his condition worsen they call but what neither lee nor his partner know be that the electronic record detail give to would not be available to and neither would his patient record as a result the ambulance be not dispatch with the urgency require and lee die will the minister set out how the improvement in the digitisation of electronic record will cover the integration of the and service so that live like lee ’s can be save 
 my hon friend outline a horrific case in her constituency where she have be a fantastic campaigner since last year information share between and already exist in many place we want standard in place to ensure that that happen safely across the country that be a key part of what we be try to do in our year plan by bring together single patient record and record within system i be very happy to follow up with she in more detail on the case she mention if that would be helpful 
 many gps say that their building be not fit for purpose and lack digital infrastructure without fully integrate electronic patient record and well system include the electronic prescription service across all hospital and community   trust we risk waste time and money while increase pressure on frontline staff will the minister outline the step be take to full integrate the electronic prescription service across all setting in dorset 
 the hon member highlight the importance of get this right not only from hospital to discharge but crucially in primary care where of patient contact happen across the system that be why a central plank of our year plan have be move the entire system from the analogue to the digital age we have allocate £ particularly in this spending review to address this issue and make sure we get this right for the system and for patient 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the year health plan for england on the prevention of ill health 
 the year health plan set out how we be transform our approach to prevent ill health through a set of ambitious measure that make the healthy choice the easy choice among those measure be our mandatory partnership with food business through which we will make shopping basket across the country healthier and our landmark tobacco and vapes bill to help deliver our ambition for a smoke free uk by gradually end the sale of tobacco product across the country

 the government be commit to address health inequality experience by people live with rare condition such as sickle cell disorder pioneer research be a cross cutting theme of the uk rare disease framework but we know that there be a small number of rare condition with a large amount of research while many more have little or no funded research i want to confirm for my hon friend that the national institute for health and care research welcome funding application for research into all and any aspect of health or care include sickle cell disorder 
 the minister talk about her year health plan with fit for the future splash across the front cover but really it be a plan from back to the future with no new idea that have not be discuss since alan milburn try to do this in the year it will only be successful if the government deliver but there be no detail in there on how they will deliver can the minister help we how will she deliver on the priority include preventive ill health where can we read the how or be it all still ferment in ministers head 
 we be already deliver as i have say the tobacco and vapes bill be make its way through parliament at the moment we be tackle the obesity crisis through tackle junk food advertising to child we be work on school food standard and we be also bring in rule around plan for junk food establishment near school we be support people to make healthy choice when it come to alcohol and we be tackle air pollution which particularly affect working class community the list go on and on and i would be more than happy to give the hon member another list if he need

 parking at eastbourne district general hospital where i be bear be woefully inadequate the car park be often full so patient have to park way away up the rodmill hill and car park service be crumble more than that lower band nhs staff now face a near doubling of car parking charge to cover the cost give that the government have delay investment in our new hospital and therefore in a new car park until the 2040s what support will they provide in the meantime to upgrade our dgh car parking facility without our nhs hero be expect to foot the bill 
 as the hon gentleman know the discussion about any advanced work arise from the new hospital programme be ongoing i be very happy for the department to continue to discuss with the trust how future investment can well meet the need of the future 
 university hospital coventry and warwickshire suffer from really poor car parking facility i have have to take both my parent there over recent year to use its specialist cardiology service the poor quality of those car parking facility cause additional stress for patient visit those service which they can ill afford when they have suffer stroke or heart attack it be become extremely vital that something be do so will the minister meet i and other local mp to discuss the crisis in car parking at the hospital

 what step his department be take to tackle health inequality across the country 
 what step his department be take to tackle health inequality across the country 
 the drive force behind this government ’s approach to health be the principle that whoever a person be and whatever their background they should receive the same world class service as everyone else base on need and not the ability to pay that be why at its core our year plan for health look to stamp out health inequality free up billion to move critical resource such as medicine and equipment to the region and patient that need they most only a labour government will protect the nhs as a service free at the point of use rebuild it and make it fit for the future for everyone in our country

 i can certainly give my hon friend that commitment the damage that be wreak by the previous government not just across our health service but across every other part of government mean that the gap between the health of the poor part of our country and that of the wealthy have widen enormously we have see real challenge in general practice which be why there be more patient per gp in the poor community compare with the rich and that particularly affect rural and coastal community with high level of deprivation we be go to carry out a review of the carr hill formula that formula have to work for general practice and i would be delighted to come and see the work that the team at carn to coast be do 
 in kensington and bayswater there be now a staggering year gap in life expectancy between man live in notting dale and those live in holland park which be just hundred of metre apart and that gap have grow in recent year the minister know that this be a whole of society issue to do with housing employment and education but can he outline what step the department be take to help inner city area with very high level of health inequality such as that experience by my constituent in kensington 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for point out those stark difference in healthy life expectancy within a single inner london borough that contain some of the rich people on earth as well as some of the poor in our country as for what we be do as a government in addition to make sure that funding follow need and that we be tackle deprivation our   approach to neighbourhood health should make sure that we be work proactively in those community that have the high level of need include pocket of deprivation within area of high affluence of course as our plan recognise and as our mission drive approach address there be so many social determinant of ill health include poverty a lack of good work damp housing dirty air and an inability to access culture and leisure opportunity that be affordable for everyone not just the privileged few those be the issue that this government be address consistent with the labour value that get we elect 
 for resident of new court place care home in borehamwood wheelchair be their lifeline however they be be badly let down by ajm healthcare their nhs wheelchair provider with multiple unresolved assessment bad communication and waiting time for repair and replacement unbelievably extend to year resident with physical and intellectual disability feel let down overlook and traumatise in tackle health inequality can i urge the secretary of state to look urgently at this provider and come to the aid of people who desperately need our help 
 i can certainly give the right hon gentleman the assurance that my department will look into the provider that he raise reason i be proud that this government increase the disabled facility grant be that it mean not just more ramp handrail and accessible kitchen and bathroom but dignity independence freedom and quality of life that be precisely what the right hon gentleman ’s constituent be be deprive of if they do not have wheelchair that meet their need i would be delighted to look into this and i be extremely angry that the failure he raise require i to do so 
 do the secretary of state agree that public health be at the heart of address the long list of inequality he have just highlight i be deeply concerned that a major reorganisation of local government and the cutting of budget to the integrate care board will undermine the co ordination that currently exist in oxfordshire to deliver public health can the secretary of state assure i and my constituent that public health will continue to be a priority at the heart of the prevention strategy and that funding for public health will rise in future year to make that possible 
 i can certainly give the hon gentleman reassurance that the work we be do to streamline and rationalise the amount of money we be spend on nhs bureaucracy mean that we will free up resource that can be spend on the frontline improve patient care and public health thank to the decision take by my department the deputy prime minister and of course my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer investment in public health be rise and the spending power of local authority be improve that be all good news for public health 
 i call the shadow minister 
 tackle health inequality require a strong workforce i recently meet a constituent who be about to qualify as a nurse but she have be unable to find work she be not alone this be a widespread problem the reason she have be give include recruitment freeze to save money and nurse bring in from overseas instead we need more nurse to tackle health inequality so will the secretary of state ensure that trust be fund to support and employ new nurse and to prioritise british nurse for british job 
 i can certainly assure the shadow minister that the chief nursing officer and i be work proactively to deal with nursing unemployment we be also work with the leadership of the nhs to make sure that we be reduce our reliance on overseas worker grateful though i be to all the healthcare worker who come from overseas to work in our health and care service the service would fall over tomorrow if they all leave so we should be extremely grateful there be certainly an overreliance and that be what we be address i have to say to the shadow minister though that both those issue be a result of appal workforce planning for which the previous government bear a huge amount of responsibility 
 what step his department be take to support neighbourhood health service 
 it be only with proper investment and reform that we will bring care close to people ’s home and into the community our year health plan will roll out a neighbourhood health service in every community as stop shop for health and care service that meet the need of local population include rural and coastal community like my hon friend ’s constituency the previous government fail to move care into the community we have already hit the ground run on deliver the year health plan and launch the national neighbourhood health implementation programme on   july   to start that work at pace 
 my constituent in barrow and furness very much welcome the government ’s move towards deliver more neighbourhood health service but my right hon friend will be aware of the great concern locally about the proposal from lancashire and south cumbria integrate care board to permanently end level critical care at furness general hospital more than people have sign my petition just this week to oppose that move will the secretary of state please ensure that decision maker meet i and representative locally to explore an alternative path forward that ensure patient safety protect the integrity of our hospital and reflect the area ’s grow population 
 that be just of many instance in which my hon friend have make the voice and view of people across barrow and furness hear loudly and clearly in this place and across government in response to her question i say yes absolutely on such an important matter her local commissioner should be meet she   as the local member of parliament and i think i can commit to that on their behalf while such decision must be make locally and clinically lead they must also be make in partnership with the local authority and the local community we must ensure that we be engage democratically elect representative and i will ensure that my hon friend secure that meeting 
 my constituent in cranleigh have no train service and no direct bus service to the royal surrey county hospital in guildford which be a big issue for old resident who do not drive do the secretary of state agree that some of the empty room in cranleigh village hospital could provide a very good opportunity for the expansion of neighbourhood health service and if he have not be brief on this pressing issue by his official may i brief he or of his ministers on it in the autumn 
 that sound like another bid for a neighbourhood health centre in the right hon gentleman ’s constituency but i be sure that local commissioner will be delighted to hear the case he have make give the experience that he bring to bear 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of industrial action on nhs service 
 before this government come to office strike be cripple the nhs cost run to £ in just year and patient see appointment reschedule strike this week be not inevitable and i sincerely hope that the british medical association will postpone this action in order to continue the constructive talk that my team and i have have with its representative in recent day our priority be to keep patient safe regardless and we will do everything we can to mitigate the impact on they and the disruption that will follow should these totally unnecessary and avoidable strike go ahead 
 in a previous role i find that health worker take industrial action only in extreme circumstance so i agree with the secretary of state that if the strike can be prevent they should be during previous resident doctor strike elective or scheduled procedure be usually postpone or plan to be postpone to free up senior doctor to cover their work but i note that the chief executive of nhs england have instruct hospital to continue those procedure have the secretary of state make any assessment of the impact that would have not just on patient but on the staff who would have to remain 
 the approach we be take be different from that take during previous period of strike action nhs leader have make it clear to i that those early strike cause much wide harm than have previously be realise there be no reason why plan care appointment relate to cancer for example as well as other condition should be treat as be less important than or play fiddle to other nhs service that be why the chief executive of nhs england have   write to nhs leader ask they to keep routine operation go to the full extent possible as well as continue priority treatment it will be for local leader to determine what be possible give staffing level which be why it be so important for resident doctor to engage with their employer about their determination or not to turn up at work this week and why i must again spell out the serious consequence for patient should these avoidable and unnecessary strike go ahead 
 healthcare assistant at blackpool teaching hospital nhs foundation trust have be underpaid on the wrong band for year but the trust have consistently fail to put that right and as a result staff have be leave with no choice but to be ballot for strike action by unison from today healthcare assistant play a vital role in our nhs but be it any wonder that they often feel undervalued and demoralise when they be not pay the correct rate for the duty that they undertake do the secretary of state agree that blackpool ’s healthcare assistant be worth just as much as those in the rest of the north west and that the trust should pay up now 
 i should declare that i be a member of unison the issue that my hon friend raise be a serious we obviously do not want to see strike action impact on her local constituent and my department will do everything we can to help bring an end to the dispute 
 i will make a more general point these sort of choice and trade off about resource be precisely why the bma resident doctor have receive a pay rise from this government in the last year ought to remember the responsibility that i and they have to some of their lower pay colleague resource be finite and it be important that i act in the interest of all nhs staff and have particular concern for those who work extremely hard but be not properly reward 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the resident doctor strike be unnecessary irresponsible and wrong recently and again today from the dispatch box the secretary of state have be resolute in not give in to the bma resident doctor committee ’s demand although i do not know the detail of the current status of his discussion with the committee may i encourage he to remain firm in his stance and while be fair to doctor to always ensure that he put the interest of patient and taxpayer 
 once again the house be speak with voice and i hope that the bma understand the strength of feeling on both side of the house about the unnecessary and irresponsible nature of the propose strike action this week discussion in recent day have be constructive and i hope that give ground for the postponement of strike action so that we can work together to avert it not just this week but altogether 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 under this government waiting list have fall by more than a quarter of a in our year but strike action put that hard win progress at risk if strike do go ahead we will do everything we can to minimise the disruption to patient who will bear the brunt of cancellation we continue to work with the bma resident doctor committee in the hope that its member will do the right thing and call off the strike none the less if they go ahead we stand ready responsive and resolute 
 there be drug relate death in the high figure ever and an increase from the number that lead the previous government to publish their drug strategy which be suppose to save life do the secretary of state agree that the exist drug strategy be not fit for purpose and will he urgently start work on replace it with a public health lead drug strategy to tackle this public health emergency 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend for his question the number of drug relate death remain far too high and we be commit to save life through access to high quality treatment for my department be provide £ in addition to the public health grant to deliver the recommendation from dame carol black ’s independent review but there be much more to do we look forward to work with my hon friend to achieve success 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 dementia be of the great health challenge that we as a society face today and in the future but too many people with dementia end up in hospital rather than be treat in more appropriate community setting the year nhs plan offer a real opportunity to shift care into the community and away from acute setting include for dementia will the secretary of state commit to work with dementia uk the alzheimer ’s society and other fantastic charity as he develop the implementation of his year nhs plan to ensure that it truly deliver for people with dementia and those who care for they 
 i absolutely agree with what the shadow secretary of state have say all shift from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention ought to benefit people with alzheimer ’s dementia and other neurological condition as will the pioneer science that we need in this country which i know he be so passionate about 
 maintain the focus on local community the fantastic st mary ’s birth centre in melton mowbray in my constituency have recently be temporarily close by the local nhs trust for month due to staff shortage although i appreciate that the secretary of state do not have power over such temporary closure and that local nhs leader have engage constructively many local people fear that temporary could risk become permanent if that risk look like become a reality by the end of the summer will the secretary of state or of his minister pre emptively agree to meet i at that point to discuss it 
 mr speaker if i may briefly crave your indulgence at what be my last dispatch box appearance for the foreseeable future may i take the opportunity after year almost continuously on the front bench in government and in opposition to thank you to say that it have be a privilege and to tell the secretary of state that it have be a pleasure to shadow he i think he know it but i genuinely wish he well 
 i absolutely give the right hon gentleman the assurance that i would be happy to meet he about his constituency issue or indeed anything else for all of the exchange that we have across these dispatch boxes on issue of disagreement what be not always readily understand beyond this house be the extent to which those on both side work extremely constructively together on the enormous number of issue that we have in common in pursuit of the national interest the virtue of wisdom kindness and selfless dedication to public service be not the preserve of side of the house the right hon gentleman have those quality in abundance and we wish he very well personally and professionally 
 uk   doctor and nurse have be volunteer their time in gaza there be shocking report this morning that israel ’s ground offensive in central gaza have compromise the effort of the world health organisation after its facility come under attack in the light of that extremely concern news do the secretary of state agree that those support the health response in gaza include uk doctor nurse and volunteer must never be target and that israel must comply with its obligation under international humanitarian law

 thing that i make clear to official when i come into this post be that every penny that be allocate to nhs dentistry must be spend on nhs dentistry we be in a crazy situation where demand for nhs dentistry be go through the roof yet we have have underspend that need to stop we will focus the spending on where it be most need include area that be under serve such as the hon gentleman ’s constituency

 in a consultation be carry out to give prescribing right to operate department practitioner but despite positive discussion with the department we be no far forwards and opd and ally health professional be be hold back do the secretary of state agree that expand their role within scope of practice will improve efficiency patient care and professional development 
 we be keen to address these sort of issue through our workforce planning and to ensure that staff be work to the top of their licensing capability always within the training provide that way we can get the good possible value for taxpayer money and most importantly of all the good outcome for patient 
 do the secretary of state agree with i about the importance of step down provision provide by community hospital such as petersfield and alton both for patient care and for relieve pressure on acute hospital such as queen alexandra and basingstoke 
 yes and that be why we be reform the well care fund 
 key to the shift to prevention be make sure that people can stay in their own home or get home from hospital the health and social care committee find that such provision cost the nhs £ every year can the secretary of state update i on what we be do to get the social care system work 
 thank to the decision that the chancellor have take spend power in social care be rise not just through department funding but in the spending power of local authority my hon friend be absolutely right we have to get the right care in the right place at the right time that often mean well care for patient and well value for taxpayer

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if he will make a statement on the closure of the prax lindsey oil refinery 
 in my oral statement on   june i inform parliament of the deeply disappointing news that the prax lindsey oil refinery have enter insolvency and that the court have appoint an official receiver to manage the situation on the site and determine the next step since then we have work urgently to ensure the safety of the refinery site and the security of fuel supply and to protect worker that also allow time for bidder to express an interest in the site follow a thorough process the official receiver have rigorously assess all the bid receive and conclude that sale of the business as a whole be not a credible option 
 i visit worker at the site on   july and i will be meet they again shortly today i know that this will be hugely disappointing news to they their family and the wide community they be all in my thought at this time a package have be offer to all directly employ at the refinery which guarantee their job and pay over the come month alongside the usual support that be offer to workforce in insolvency situation the government will also immediately fund a comprehensive training guarantee for those refinery worker to ensure that they have the skill need and the support to find job in for example the grow clean energy workforce 
 furthermore we understand that the official receiver continue to explore various proposal for asset on the site i therefore remain hopeful that a solution will be find that create future employment opportunity at the immingham site the refinery will continue to process crude for the rest of the month and the official receiver will continue sell refined product for a number of week give buyer time to adjust their supply chain 
 the former owner leave the refinery in an untenable position and give the government little time to act that be why the energy secretary immediately demand an investigation into their conduct and the circumstance surround the insolvency and why i have repeatedly call on the owner to do the right thing and provide financial support to the workforce at this difficult time 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when the prax lindsey refinery close its door in october there will be only oil refinery remain in the united kingdom follow the news about grangemouth a few month ago this be the oil refinery to close in the united kingdom in only month prompt serious question about our energy security and resilience in immingham people be wake up today to the reality that redundancy be now inevitable it be estimate that about job will be lose for the community in lincolnshire that be seismic 
 as the minister say we be aware of the long stand financial issue with prax group and i reiterate my support for the government ’s investigation into its director what progress have be make on that investigation when do he expect the report to be make 
 we can not escape the fundamental crisis face our manufacturing sector as jim ratcliffe have say the sector be face extinction because of 
 enormously high energy price and crippling carbon tax bill 
 the minister ’s department know that to be true and have exempt some industry from pay the net levy recuse specific business from pay the extortionate green subsidy cost that be a ridiculous situation that see subsidy be pay by the government to business to exempt they from the charge be impose by that very same government we be truly through the look glass the department be wilfully talk down the oil and gas industry with hostile language and an impossible fiscal regime while oversee the deindustrialisation of the united kingdom through the perpetuated high cost of industrial energy this be not simply manage decline it be accelerate decline drive by ideology and steer from whitehall 
 will the minister tell we what work be be do to ensure the future of the remain oil refinery in the united kingdom what if any assessment have be make of the uk ’s resilience give the steep reduction in our refining capacity over the past month what if any assessment have be make of the increase reliance on import that will be necessary as a result of the reduction in british refining capacity will he please change course and start speak up for our oil industry upstream and downstream which see from the current government a disregard for it its worker and the community that rely most on it 
 i agree with the shadow minister who be right to point out the impact that news like this will have on the workforce who be hear it this week as well as the wide impact it have on their family and the community that be why it be so important that we provide that support 
 on the investigation there be not much that i can update the house on at the moment the insolvency service be carry out that investigation and it would be wrong for minister to interfere in that but we have obviously give the direction that we expect it to be complete as quickly as possible give the mess we find the company in i would not be surprised if it take a bit of time for the investigation to get to grip with what be go on there but that be for the insolvency service to resolve 
 on resilience and fuel supply we have be really clear throughout that we have do everything we can to try to find a buyer to keep the site operate as a go concern which be important for the workforce as well as for local resilience but prax lindsey oil refinery comprise about of our remain refinery capacity phillips a much large refinery be immediately next door in the past few week we have already see fuel supply adjust and commercial contract renegotiate although we clearly want the refinery to stay open our assessment suggest that there be not an immediate risk to fuel supply locally or in the wide area but we will continue to monitor that 
 on the shadow minister ’s wide point i will repeat what i have say on a number of occasion we do support the oil and gas industry i have spend a lot of time with the industry understand some of its challenge which be long stand particularly around job lose over the past decade and we consult widely on what the future of energy in the north east should look like to give confidence to the industry we inherit the fiscal regime from the previous government we have consult quickly on what the future of the energy profit levy should look like to ensure certainty about the fiscal landscape the treasury will respond to that consultation in due course we want to give certainty but we also want to recognise that this be an industry in transition and bury our head in the sand and pretend that that be not the case do nothing to protect the workforce in the long term we will therefore continue to invest in the new industry of the future and in that wide strategy 
 refinery be important to our economy and will continue to be important that be why i bring all of industry together in a roundtable to discuss the challenge face the refinery sector i be shock to discover that that be the time there have be such an invitation from the government in year i ask the shadow minister to reflect on who be in power for year 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 the minister be absolutely right so be the shadow minister to focus on the job and the community affect by the worrying news come from lindsey he be also right to say that the problem be the result of shockingly bad management my select committee will look at the future of refining in this country in a off session in the autumn and we will be able to take further evidence at that point 
 in response to what the shadow minister say about energy price will the minister confirm that the way to get industrial energy price down just as with domestic energy price be to reduce our reliance on the volatility uncertainty and high price that be determine by vladimir putin and the petrostate and that we have to manage the transition not shut our eye to it or somehow play into culture war as reform want we to do 
 my hon friend be right separate from all the wide issue face the refinery sector and the oil and gas sector generally it be right we recognise that this week there be worker hear some devastating news detailed work will be go on into how much of the site we can utilise in the future and assessment be under way about how credible some of the bid be we will do more work on that and i be sure that his inquiry will be useful 
 on energy cost more generally of the conversation i have when i meet the refinery sector be about how we could do more to bring down its cost we be look at how we could support refinery more through include they in the energy intensive industry compensation scheme which would obviously cut cost and help uk refinery with their competitiveness that be not straightforward but we be determined to look at that 
 on my hon friend ’s final point he be right that the overall context of what we be do as a government be drive forward the transition to clean power because it give we back our energy security and take away the volatility in price that have be so devastating to household and business over the past few year it be also the economic opportunity that help drive forward refinery into what could be profitable business in that transition they will continue to play a part in that and we will support they to do so 
 we have a lot of business today so if we could help each other that would be very useful i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the closure of prax lindsey oil refinery be deeply troubling with up to job at risk across the supply chain it be a devastating blow to worker their family and the community that rely on the refinery we need a clear strategy to support those whose livelihood be in jeopardy that mean practical help with reskille and retraining this be also an opportunity for target green investment in industry that can offer decent secure job for the future 
 this crisis speak to a wide failure the uk still lack a proper plan for a just transition that give oil and gas worker real confidence about what come next we need to wind down fossil fuel in a way that provide genuine opportunity well pay green job clean energy infrastructure and proper support for the community that have long power this country as other party embrace climate denialism and internet conspiracy theory the liberal democrats call on the government to ensure that we do not backtrack on our climate target undermine green investor confidence and abandon our leadership on the world stage when it come to climate change 
 what step be the government take to ensure that contingency plan be in place so that those whose job be at risk be guarantee support and opportunity to redeploy their skill secondly how be the government ensure that investment in skill and regeneration be target so that it have the great impact where it be need most finally what step be the government take to ensure that the transition to renewable energy make the good use of the skill and experience of oil and gas worker in the place affect such as the humber estuary 
 i write down the hon gentleman ’s point and then he come on to specific question but i will respond to the point he rightly say that this have be devastating news for the worker he also say something that i want to echo and which i say to the worker when i meet they last week this decision and what have happen to the company be no reflection at all on the incredible very skilled work that they be do i want to reiterate that so often in these case the worker bear the brunt of decision take by the company and that be a great shame he be right and we will support the worker my department be fund the training guarantee to make sure that all those worker be give an assessment of their training need and future employment desire so they can be give tailor support we will make sure that be roll out in the come month 
 on the hon gentleman ’s wide point about the transition he be right to say that we need a proper plan that be why we consult on the future of energy in the north sea both through a series of question and through a much broad question about what the future of our energy sector look like it will have oil and gas for many decade to come but already thousand of job be be create in other offshore industry and we want to support that 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight that investor confidence be critical it be shameful that people would seek to damage investor confidence in this country in the name of net rhetoric the truth be that there have be more than £ of investment in clean energy in this country that mean job and opportunity in all our community across the country and those who would talk that down should be ashamed 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests in respect of the gmb trade union the minister say that he be engage with worker will he set out in more detail what engagement he be undertake with the trade union that be those worker representative will he give the house an assurance that the detailed modelling work undertake by the department include the impact on the wide supply chain 
 i also declare that i be a member of the gmb trade union that be record in my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 i have engage with both the unite trade union rep who be on the site and with day shift worker who be not represent by a trade union to make sure that i hear from they i meet they early this month and last week at the refinery and i will meet they in about an hour ’s time to talk through this more we want to continue that engagement with they 
 i call the father of the house 
 obviously my concern be my constituent who work in the refinery in the neighbour constituency that of my hon friend   the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers i be sure that the minister will give they reassurance about enhanced redundancy also may i ask a question on behalf of my rural constituent in north lincolnshire and i declare an interest as i live there this be a deeply rural area where we rely on heating oil because we be not on main gas what impact will closure of the refinery have on the price of heating oil 
 on redundancy because of how the company go into insolvency the worker will be entitle to statutory redundancy that be not acceptable give the role that they play in deliver for the company for many year that be why i have publicly ask the owner of the company to put their hand in their pocket and improve the redundancy package it be not possible for the government to improve the package directly but i be still hopeful that the company owner    will do the right thing we be provide a training guarantee to the worker from government fund to make sure that they have that enhance support 
 i be happy to take away the point about heating oil we have be assess the situation over the past few week include a number of week during which fuel have not leave the refinery at its normal pace to see what the impact be on supply across the region that impact have be minimal that be partly because a significant amount of fuel and product come from the refinery next door however we will continue to monitor that and if there be an impact on price i be happy to look into that 
 much like the ceramics sector the refinery sector be an energy intensive industry that be at the mercy of industrial energy price which be beyond its control but have a huge impact on its viability it be welcome that the minister think that the energy intensive certification programme could expand to include the refinery sector but he will know that the business level test be a huge barrier that need to be overcome it mean that many company will not be eligible for the programme he will also know that the british industry competitiveness scheme be not due to come online for another year indeed consultation on that scheme have yet to be open refinery and ceramic company be look down the barrel of ever increase industrial energy bill will he give they some indication of what help and support be available now before the new scheme come online so that we do not have more statement about closed factory in the next few month 
 my hon friend be right and it be deeply frustrating that we inherit many of these issue which be unresolved for such a long time these be not problem that arrive in the past month bring in the refinery sector for talk with government about the challenge would have be a fairly obvious thing to do at least once in the past year clearly that do not occur to the previous government and we have inherit challenge
