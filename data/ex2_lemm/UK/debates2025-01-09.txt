 the secretary of state be ask 
 what financial support she be provide to local transport authority and mayor 
 welcome secretary of state 
 may i start by say it be very good to be here i wish you mr speaker and the house staff a happy new year and i wish the aviation minister my hon friend   the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane a happy birthday

 i begin by welcome the secretary of state to the dispatch box for her question time she bring great experience of work to bring transport authority together my constituency of worsley and eccles suffer from regular serious rush hour congestion how can she support transport authority in urban area to work with neighbouring authority to ensure a strategic approach be take across commuter belt to alleviate congestion 
 i thank my hon friend for his kind word and i assure he that the government be commit to improve local transport across individual local authority boundary we have provide more than £ in funding to the greater manchester combine authority in his area which take a strategic approach   to manage transport across its region my right hon friend the deputy prime minister have also set out ambitious measure in the recent english devolution white paper to support more join up run of local transport network which people rely upon every day 
 i welcome the secretary of state to the dispatch box and say happy birthday to the aviation minister bus in my constituency be not adequate and the situation have be make bad since the £ fare cap be lift local authority in bath want to improve the situation they want to franchise bus service themselves but their hand be tie by the labour west of england combine authority mayor who refuse to do so what should local authority such as bath do 
 the government step in to ensure that bus fare would not explode at the beginning of this year when the £ fare cap that the previous government legislate for run out in the bad case scenario cost on some service could have increase by and it be important that we take that action to ensure such fare rise be avoidable i advise her local authority to work through any issue with the regional mayor it be vital that we see transport authority of all type collaborate to ensure that we have good high frequency high quality bus service for local people to go about their daily life 
 may i also welcome the secretary of state to her place it be a delight to see she there i wonder if she might help i in circumstance where a mayor do not want to embrace the opportunity of the bus services no bill and fully re regulate as in the tees valley will she give some consideration to provide a power in forthcoming legislation for the public to overreach that will she consider that option 
 a number of option be outline in the bus services no bill which have its reading in the other place yesterday include franchising option enhance local bus partnership and municipal ownership of bus company while my hon friend ’s suggestion be not currently in the bill i gently point out to he that there would have to be an authority to let contract include with private provider while i be happy to explore option we need to think through the practicality of suggestion such as his 
 cullompton and wellington railway station be of the most advanced of all the programme in the restore your railway fund the exist local transport authority have already invest in get we to the stage of a full business case with a high benefit cost ratio of can the secretary of state confirm that this programme be in no way disadvantage compare with those transport authority in urban area that have mayor 
 we consider business case for rail enhancement fairly and no undue advantage would be give to the area that the hon gentleman suggest i be fortunate in my couple of week in this job to   visit the opening of the northumberland line which provide service up to ashington i know what an invaluable difference the improved connectivity on the rail network can provide i would be happy to talk to he about his scheme 
 if she will review the uk ’s participation in the european geostationary navigation overlay service programme 
 the department for transport be work with the department for science innovation and technology to consider option for the uk ’s access to a navigation system of this type which lapse follow brexit this work be ongoing and no decision have be make at this time 
 i also welcome the secretary of state to her new role and i look forward to work across party boundary where possible egnos be a satellite enhancement system for gps prior to brexit highlands and islands airports ltd which be headquarter in my constituency have be work with national air traffic services on develop the use of the system and invest a lot of time and effort it would increase mapping accuracy and vitally enable plane fly lifeline air service to land in a broad range of circumstance improve service and reliability as the minister say that work have stall since brexit but the government can re engage with the programme should they choose as it be open to non eu member will the minister commit to do that 
 i be grateful to the hon member for put this on my radar interruption too early laughter 
 do not give up the day job 
 it be an important issue we be consider the cost and benefit of all option and it be very good particularly for regional airport we be work with the eu to identify area where we can strengthen co operation for mutual benefit but it be still too early to discuss that specific area in detail i hope to come back to the house at a later time with a more consider view 
 what step she be take to help improve road safety for vulnerable road user 
 i assure the hon member that this government treat road safety with the utmost seriousness we be committed to reduce the number of those kill and seriously injure on our road my department be develop our road safety strategy and will set out further detail in due course 
 i join other in welcome the secretary of state to her place bikeability be the world ’s large road safety programme recent datum from the bikeability trust show that in area with high level of training for child the number of people kill or seriously injure on the road decrease do the minister agree that bikeability training be an essential life skill that everyone should have access to and will she commit to join i on a visit to a local oxfordshire school to see the scheme in action 
 a total of people have participate in active travel england ’s training programme include a record half a child receive cycle training last year i be a keen cyclist and have be knock off my bike in the last couple of year i understand how important it be to feel confident about cycling safely i would be happy to join the hon member to see some of that work in action 
 i warmly welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place a couple of year ago some child in my constituency start a campaign about a really dangerous stretch of road where car speed and there be no pedestrian crossing tragically a few month ago of those child lose her grandmother to a car crash on that very stretch of road this be devastating for family and community what step be the government take to make our road safe 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that case every single death on our road be tragic which be precisely why we will bring forward further measure with the new road safety strategy the in more than a decade which will consider how to prevent such appalling tragedy include in her constituency 
 as police and crime commissioner for lancashire i invest significant amount of money in increase the resource available to target drink and drug driver which be a key plank in improve road safety it have become easy for police to target drug driver over recent year in particular through the advancement of technology but while arrest rate have improve charge rate be still lag behind it take month for drug driver compare with week for drink driver d.tec international be a fylde company that provide all police force with drugwipe kit it would like to use technology that be use in other european country to improve charge rate through the use of roadside saliva testing will the minister meet i and d.tec international to look at how this technology could improve the speed with which we can get drug driver ban and off our road 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise concern about the impact of drug driving those affect by an impairment drug be involve in of fatality last year just before christmas i go out with jo shiner of the lead police officer responsible for road police and see the work that be happen and hear about prosecution which the hon gentleman have raise i would be very happy to meet he to discuss the matter far 
 st helens road in my constituency have regrettably become the site of numerous serious car crash and local resident have raise their grave concern with i about both speeding and dangerous driving how be the minister work with local leader in particular to drive improvement to road safety 
 my hon friend be right to raise the concern of his constituent local authority have a vital role to play they be responsible for introduce road safety measure appropriate to their area of course the department be responsible for legislation and the guidance to help they to do so i continue to engage with local authority to ensure we be provide they with the support they need to make our road safe 
 what step her department be take to help maintain road 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 the government be determined to help local authority in england to tackle the highway maintenance backlog that be the result of a decade of under investment by the previous government we be make an immediate start by provide an extra £ next year an increase of nearly compare with the current financial year 
 the a1 be a vital road link for the scottish borders and scotland to the rest of the united kingdom and labour ’s decision to scrap much need improvement will harm the local economy and stop business invest in job the local labour mp   the hon member for north northumberland david smith have say he be disappointed and frustrated by the decision of his labour colleague what do the labour government have against car driver and truck user on road in rural scotland 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that we have nothing against car driver and truck user we appreciate the long stand local desire for dualle the a1 from morpeth to ellingham but i be sorry to say that in the assessment we carry out post the general election it represent poor value for money there have be several delay to the development   consent order decision and the contractor be decommission more than year ago in that time scheme cost have rise significantly make the scheme even less affordable and far worsen the value for money have say that i recognise that there be safety issue on the exist route which we will need to look at carefully as we would with any other part of the network however that alone do not warrant the dualle scheme 
 i welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place pothole represent a serious issue in basingstoke with many constituent tell i of damaged vehicle and even physical injury the aa which be base in basingstoke highlight inconsistent standard across the country with some pothole leave unaddresse for long than other the pothole partnership urge uk wide standard and permanent repair over temporary fix i welcome the government ’s additional investment to tackle this issue but will the secretary of state consider ensure that council adopt common standard so that community such as basingstoke no long face dangerous crumble road 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the damage that pothole can cause for all road user we have commit record money to fix this issue and to enable council to get on with this work all local authority should have their own standard of road maintenance service and inspection in line with local need and priority however i do want to update the department ’s guidance to local authority on how good to look after their highway network and ensure good practice be follow and so that there be common minimum standard so that all road user know what they can expect 
 i also welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place many of my constituent in wolverhampton west complain not only about the number of pothole in our road but about the standard of repair with some pothole reappear shortly after they have be repair while the £ of funding for council be very welcome will she please confirm what other step the government be take to ensure that our road be always well maintain to avoid the risk of injury to people and damage to vehicle 
 we agree that local authority should not just patch pothole but focus on long term preventive programme for repair and maintain all part of the highway network include footpath pavement and bridge we will require local authority to follow good practice to get the full funding uplift and we will update the guidance document well manage highway infrastructure a code of practice to support local authority in that and to emphasise the importance of proactive preventive measure 
 pothole plague the street of thurrock and be a daily reminder of year of conservative neglect stifford clays where my own tentative attempt to learn to drive take place be particularly bad but the effect be feel throughout my constituency i be pleased that the secretary of state be tackle this issue with   £ commit for thurrock specifically will she tell i how much motorist in thurrock could save under labour ’s plan 
 our broken road have long be a national embarrassment and a proper fund to fix our road have long be overdue in answer to my hon friend ’s specific question rac datum show that the average cost of pothole relate damage to vehicle be about £ with severe repair often cost much more the government ’s extra funding for local highway maintenance next year could therefore save individual motorist in thurrock hundred of pound if not more 
 local resident tell i of their frustration at the epidemic level of pothole across my constituency after year of failure to grasp the problem motorist be all too often the one who will pay the price do the secretary of state agree that local council like northumberland north tyneside and newcastle in my constituency will benefit from proper long term funding to allow they to plan work and carry out repair 
 i totally agree with my hon friend we need to get the basic right as a country and fix our road be the step to get our economy fire on all cylinder we do see a decade of decline and under investment under the previous conservative government the additional £ that we have allocate if it be all use to fill pothole would fill another pothole every year smash our manifesto commitment to provide funding for an extra 
 whether on silverdale road rodmill drive quebec close or ceylon place pothole litter our road in eastbourne after year of neglect by the conservative county council indeed the mirzas at my local garage have replace my tyre a number of time and i thank they for it we also have a ridiculous situation where pothole right next to each other be not sort out at the same time will the secretary of state urge east sussex county council to stop that wasteful practice and ensure that eastbourne benefit from its fair share of the nearly £ grant to the south east to tackle pothole 
 i have be clear that local transport authority should use the money in a way that provide excellent value for money for the taxpayer and the situation that the hon member describe do concern i we have wait a long time for this level of investment to come forward and i be keen to see local authority such as his cracking on with the job and make sure that motorist all road user for that matter have safe smooth road that they can travel on 
 the road in wokingham like everywhere else in the country have deteriorate in the last few year we need to stop pothole not just fix they and that mean regularly resurface road the unfunded backlog of resurfacing leave by the conservatives in wokingham be about £ and get big nationally it be £ when will the minister ’s department deliver proper funding for wokingham ’s road 
 i disagree slightly with the hon gentleman because i think a £ uplift be proper funding it represent on average a increase and it take the overall amount of funding up to £ however i do agree with his substantive point some of this money should be use for proactive preventative road resurfacing because in some case that will provide the good value for money for the taxpayer 
 hundred of local authority road across the country include half joint bridge build in the 1960 and 1970 that be now dangerously unsafe they include the brigsteer road and underbarrow road bridge lead out of kendal which have be close for the last month cause great inconvenience to the local community they be build with government fund or year ago but local council be unable to replace they with the fund available to they now will the secretary of state meet representative of westmorland and furness council as a matter of urgency so that the bridge can be reopen and our community can be reconnecte quickly 
 i will ask my colleague the minister for the future of roads to have that meeting with the council however the additional money that we have provide and the individual allocation that be announce before christmas can be use not just for road maintenance but for bridge and pavement 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i too welcome the secretary of state to her post and look forward to help she to do an excellent job 
 as we can see follow the last few day of flooding change weather pattern be damage our road and increase pothole the last government allocate an additional £ for road improvement pay for by the cancellation of the northern leg of hs2 yet all we have see from labour be a commitment of £ for this financial year will the secretary of state commit to match the additional £ for road maintenance 
 we be more than match the commitment make by the previous government let i say gently to the hon gentleman that his commitment in respect of resurface road fall into exactly the same category as the promise to provide new hospital and a range of other commitment that prove not to be worth the paper they be write on they be fantasy figure unlike the labour party ’s promise to deliver change an additional £ be come into our highway maintenance budget so that people across the country can see that change deliver to their local area 
 i do not know about you mr speaker but i be not sure whether that be a commitment to match the £ or whether the secretary of state consider it to be a fantasy commitment however it be not just the £ investment that seem to have go miss as soon as they be in power the labour government cancel the a27 bypass the stonehenge tunnel improvement to the a47 in great yarmouth the a1 from morpeth to ellingham junction of the   m27 at southampton and other project that be £ ax from work to help motorist what have they do with the money have labour prioritise pay rise for union over improve road and help motorist 
 the truth of the matter be that when this government come to office we inherit a raft of half baked unfunded scheme that we be have to work through to provide a sensible pipeline of infrastructure improvement for our country i will take no lesson from the hon gentleman about investment in our national infrastructure 
 what step she be take to help prevent road closure when roadwork be not take place 
 i be delighted to confirm that as part of the £ investment in highway maintenance that the government announce before christmas we will clamp down on disruptive work by double fix penalty notice for utility company that fail to comply with rule and extend charge for work that overrun into weekend 
 i draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 driver in my constituency be sick to death of the endless road closure and temporary traffic light when no work be take place will the minister demand that utility company do everything in their power to get road open as quickly as possible particularly when they have dig they up under the emergency procedure 
 absolutely there can be legitimate reason why work be sometimes leave unoccupied for example when they be wait for material to cure or gas to vent but i take the hon member ’s point particularly where utility be use emergency procedure unnecessarily we have examine street manager datum and speak to industry representative and find no evidence of misuse none the less give the number of urgent work which be of course not unrelated to the appalling state of our road leave by the previous government we will see what more can be do to ensure that these work be manage and communicate to road user properly 
 roadwork plague my constituency a significant issue be that utility company dig up the road without require council permission and they often leave these site incomplete while different team carry out their work cause chaos and congestion in the process we frequently face the absurd situation where there be roadwork on diversion route for roadwork do the minister agree that we need to require utility company to co ordinate with council to properly plan this maintenance work and complete their project in a timely manner in order to avoid congestion 
 my hon friend be prove a great champion for road user in his constituency the simple answer to his question be yes local authority already   have a legal duty to co ordinate all work on their network and utility company have a duty to co operate and we will ensure that they do so 
 what step she be take to help improve the accessibility of public transport 
 we be work with industry to deliver a transport network that put passenger and their need at its heart the new aviation accessibility task and finish group for example bring together industry and consumer advocate with hand experience to improve accessibility in air travel the government will take advantage of the benefit of a unified rail network to deliver a more reliable and consistent customer experience for everyone with accessibility need and our bus bill will make bus travel more accessible and inclusive include by extend the requirement for relevant bus staff to undertake disability training 
 i thank the minister for his response leagrave station in luton be of a number grant access for all funding by the previous government for long overdue lift however network rail now say that this money be never allocate and that it only qualify for a business case despite a feasibility study already be agree and complete those who can make the nearly journey from leagrave station include myself be leave with a crumble footbridge that be not accessible for many will the minister offer assurance that access for all funding to leagrave station will be honour and will he meet i and the bedfordshire rail access network to establish the quick path to have lift at leagrave station 
 my hon friend be a formidable advocate for this have raise it numerous time the rail minister be carefully consider the decision make by the previous government in relation to the access for all programme my hon friend will be aware that leagrave be of station across britain select by the previous government for further consideration of whether they could be make step free between the entrance and all platform we will shortly update the house on our approach to access for all but let i assure she that we be committed to improve the accessibility of the rail network recognise the social and economic benefit that that bring 
 like   the hon member for luton north sarah owen i have station in my constituency in hedge end and swanwick that be allocate money by the previous government for accessibility lift unlike her rail company mine do accept that that money be allocate within the week of this government take over that be scrap and the rail minister write to i without any clear plan for when this government will make an announcement on what will happen with the access for all scheme the minister have just say that it will happen shortly can he be more clear for my constituent who have be wait for a very long time so that disabled people and people with wheelchair and pushchair in   my constituency can make the journey they need to make when will this government make an announcement on access for all 
 i can assure the hon member that as soon as i be in a position to do so i will give he more information on the access for all programme 
 of my friend ruth and janet be wheelchair user of they as a result of an accident just outside this place year ago they can not travel together on our bus as there be only ever wheelchair space they often book assistance at train station only for it not to turn up leave they strand their handling on plane have lead to not only bruise and pain but loss of dignity and sometimes miss flight when assistance do not come in time they be now reluctant to go on holiday if it mean fly will the secretary of state meet they and set up consultation with disabled passenger up and down the country so that our public transport can meet their need in every region will she require local authority take over bus service to consult disabled passenger and set minimum standard for delivery 
 we want a transport system for everyone in which accessibility be design as standard across the network so that we can make it easy for people to get on and off service and build a safe and more secure network particularly for woman and girl it be the government ’s ambition for disabled people to have equal access to transport recognise the need of people with visible and less visible condition and i would be more than happy to meet my hon friend 
 leuchars train station in my constituency serve st andrews and be well use by resident student and tourist but its wheelchair access be completely unacceptable it feel as though we fall through the gap between the scottish government and the uk government on access for all can the minister confirm whether the access for all review be look at ensure that those in the devolved nation do not miss out 
 i can assure the hon lady that i will raise this issue with the rail minister i be quite confident that he have have these discussion with the devolved government 
 what step she be take to support the use and production of sustainable aviation fuel 
 the saf mandate which be of the pioneer policy of its kind come into force on   january   to build domestic demand for saf we be also grow uk supply through the advanced fuel fund and we be committed to introduce a revenue certainty mechanism in the king ’s speech to encourage investment in uk saf production 
 i thank the minister for his response this uk government be indeed work at pace to position the uk as a global leader in the rapidly grow saf industry which be vital for decarbonise aviation and our aviation industry and for grow our economy will he commit in the forthcoming sustainable aviation fuel bill to bring forward the timeline for the revenue certainty mechanism to the end of this year or perhaps early accelerate that measure which have wide support will give investor the confidence they need to back the potential saf facility across the uk include in grangemouth which be near my constituency 
 i thank my hon friend who have be a huge campaigner for grangemouth we have commit to bring forward the revenue certainty mechanism we have already legislate for a fuel mix in the saf mandate which come into force on   january   this year and we look forward to the bill come before the house when parliamentary time allow 
 i thank the minister for his answer i know that he have a deep interest in northern ireland so may i ask a similar question northern ireland want to provide the necessary aviation fuel and have the ability to do so what progress have he make in his discussion with the northern ireland assembly to ensure that we can be part of the future of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland which be always well together 
 the hon member be a doughty champion of air travel and saf in northern ireland through the advanced fuel fund we have project and we be currently invest well over £ across the uk to see what come forward in the market and i hope that northern ireland will be integral to that process 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i too wish the minister a very happy birthday 
 estimate suggest that the saf mandate provision and the revenue certainty mechanism will still leave a shortfall with a family of face over £ extra to fly on holiday by that be a clear concern for consumer as well as the airline industry net should not come at an additional cost to consumer or undermine freedom in this case the freedom to fly the test must surely be how to defossilise decarbonise and allow people to do the same at the same cost what step be the minister take in conjunction with the treasury to close the financial gap between incentive in the mandate and the actual increase cost of switch to saf for the end consumer 
 i think the good will end with happy birthday 
 i remind the shadow minister that a little over month ago in of his well video the then prime minister come out into downing street look at the sky and laud the policy he want when we see virgin atlantic ’s saf trip across the atlantic this be the previous government ’s policy but because of the sclerotic nature of that government we be only now get on with implement both the saf mandate and the revenue   support mechanism as the shadow minister know a regular review point be bake into the legislation so that we can revisit target if require 
 of course there be always another way much of the debate so far on saf have be about fuel make from feedstock and waste product unlike fuel that require feedstock whose input cost will only ever go up the industrial process that create power to liquid synthetic aviation fuel will actually see its production cost reduce with some predict cost parity between the production of these synthetic fuel and the extraction and production of fossil fuel within a decade do the minister agree that synthetic offer a much well long term solution and will he reprioritise the government ’s approach to saf away from transitional solution and towards synthetic 
 the hon gentleman run his car on synthetic fuel so i know his passion there be many way to get to saf the saf mandate be support by industry and there be a real opportunity to establish a plethora of production we can create thousand of new well pay job while protect the pound in the holidaymaker ’s pocket 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of compensation for rail passenger in cheltenham due to the impact of the old oak common station development 
 the department continue to work closely with the rail industry to minimise the disruption to passenger on the great western main line during the new station ’s construction and operation our priority be to mitigate the impact on passenger as far as possible by invest £ for service continuity during period of disruption 
 the secretary of state ’s constituent will also be affect compensation come in many form it may be in the form of well wi fi on train to improve the service for business user it may be in the form of more rolling stock to end the bizarre practice of run half length train out of paddington at peak time and it may be in the form of an investigation into how we can reduce the ridiculous turnaround time at gloucester station that delay cheltenham passenger so much i hope the minister will confirm that all these thing be be look into for passenger in my constituency and the secretary of state ’s constituency 
 the rail minister have meet mp from both side of the house to discuss this issue and have attend an industry programme board to ensure that passenger interest be consider and that disruption be minimise for passenger both during and after construction 
 be an exciting year for derby partly because of the progress on great british railways which will be headquarter in derby and rightly so can we also make this the year   that the british public fall in love again with rail travel by give gbr a strict timetable to simplify complicated ticketing and fare and to implement digital pay as you go as well as automatic compensation 
 order i be not sure that fit the original question we have probably stray too far 
 what step she be take to increase railway capacity 
 transport be central to this government ’s plan for rebuild britain and grow our economy we be commit to invest in the rail capacity need to support that growth this mean improve performance and timetable to make the good use of the capacity we have but it also mean invest in new and improved infrastructure such as high speed the trans pennine route upgrade and east west rail 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer and welcome she to her place ely junction be a major bottleneck in our rail network and the ely area capacity enhancement scheme be design to improve that if the scheme go ahead it could deliver over a quarter of a extra rail passenger journey and take lorry journey off the road every year it will also help the midland and the north grow their economy because it will improve freight transport to and from port the midland and the north to add to all those benefit the business case stack up every pound invest will deliver nearly £ of benefit will the minister 
 order the question be far too long i think the hon lady need to secure an adjournment debate on the subject the secretary of state can grasp the sense of the question 
 i understand how passionately the hon lady feel about the scheme and the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood   respond to her write parliamentary question on the subject at the end of november project like this in area like her have the potential to contribute to the government ’s plan to deliver economic growth she will know that the spending review be come up so a decision on the scheme and any potential timetable will be subject to the outcome of that review 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her place and i look forward to work with she 
 the original vision for hs2 be to link london with the midland and the north and to address the grow capacity challenge on the west coast main line with a whole new rail line the last government panic and mothball much of the project because of cost overrun on phase thus incur yet further cost i welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to get a grip on the   phase cost overrun but do the government plan to deliver a rail solution link phase north of birmingham to the rest of the country thus deliver the government ’s vision to drive growth for the whole country 
 i congratulate my hon friend on her election as chair of the transport committee she will be formidable and i look forward to work with she 
 i be pleased that my hon friend raise the question of the mess we inherit from the conservative government on hs2 and rail connectivity in the north when we enter government in july we find a rag bag collection of half- bake unfunded spending commitment for rail scheme up and down the country the previous government draw up their network north plan on the back of a napkin as part of the spending review we have start the hard work of identify a realistic pipeline of scheme that be affordable and will deliver well connectivity in partnership with local leader 
 i call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her new position my party know she well from her hard work on london ’s transport network we look forward to continue the constructive relationship we have with she then and with her predecessor in this house 
 may i take this opportunity to express my sadness at the passing of my liberal democrat transport colleague baroness jenny randerson jenny be a force of nature intelligent kind hard work and principle with a mischievous wit and love of life i learn a huge amount from she in the few month we work together and will miss she deeply 
 improve transport link to wales be an issue close to baroness randerson ’s heart and she regularly press in the other house will the secretary of state review the tories decision to class hs2 as an england and wales project thus deprive wales of billion of pound of barnett formula funding and will she commit to a high speed rail link from birmingham to crewe to ensure that mid and north wales can at least share the benefit of hs2 
 may i extend my condolence and those of the government to the family of baroness randerson i know she be a deeply love and highly respected colleague to many 
 on the hon gentleman ’s substantive question i have already meet ken skates the welsh minister for transport and i be work closely with the secretary of state for wales to ensure that we bring public transport improvement to wales which i hope will be baroness randerson ’s last legacy 
 what step she be take to improve accessibility at pokesdown railway station 
 south western railway have be work closely with network rail and the local authority   to provide a viable scheme that will result in the installation of new lift at the station to establish the likely cost of the scheme and assess affordability detailed design work be under way and be expect to be finalise in 
 i thank the minister for that very helpful answer the people of pokesdown be certainly very keen for their lift which they have be wait a long time for back in the 1980 and 1990 train service between bournemouth and london waterloo take the historically fast time of minute will the minister meet i and south western railway to discuss whether we can restore that fast time as well as to discuss pokesdown 
 there be no current plan to introduce an express service between bournemouth and london but i will keep my hon friend update on the future plan regard south western railway which will become the operator to be take back into public ownership in may 
 the resident of wareham just along the way from bournemouth have be wait more than year for electronic gate 
 order this be a very niche question 
 it be a very niche question and i want to ask about the next railway line along from bournemouth 
 in which case it do not count thank you for that clarification let we go to topical question 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 transport be at the heart of this government ’s plan for change since i join the department more than a month ago we have introduce the bus services bill which will give transport authority across the country the tool to take back control of local service we be bring clarity and confidence to our automotive industry with a consultation on how we will restore the phase out date for new petrol and diesel car we have also confirm the train operator that will be bring under public control later this year 
 we have deliver record funding to protect vital bus route and keep fair cap and we smash our manifesto target with a £ investment to repair more pothole on britain ’s break road i be determined that our transport system deliver reliable accessible journey for all enable the construction of million of new home support the job and industry of the future and enable rise living standard for everyone in every part of britain

 i be happy to speak far with the hon gentleman about his concern regard local bus service i know how critical bus service be for young people want to get to school people want to get to work and old people want to access vital lifeline service i be happy to meet he to talk in more detail about his local concern

 i note the secretary of state ’s answer but in the real world we know that the government ’s union paymaster will keep push for more labour ’s plan to scrap the minimum service level will give the union more power to hold the railway hostage do the secretary of state accept that the christmas chaos will not be a off and will in fact be the start of an ongoing decline in reliability

 undoubtedly 
 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if she will make a statement on the grow pressure of borrowing cost on the public finance 
 where be she 
 i be always grateful to see conservative members welcome i to the house 
 financial market be always evolve as the shadow chancellor know so there be a long stand convention that the government do not comment on specific financial market movement and i will not break that convention today financial market movement include change in government bond or gilt yield which represent the government ’s borrowing cost be determine by a wide range of international and domestic factor it be normal for the price and yield of gilt to vary when there be wide movement in global financial market include in response to economic datum 
 in recent month move in financial market have be largely drive by datum and global geopolitical event which be to be expect as market adjust to new information uk gilt market continue to function in an orderly way underlying demand for the uk ’s debt remain strong with a generally well diversify investor base the debt management office ’s gild sale operation continue to see strong demand the late auction hold yesterday receive time as many bid as the amount on offer 
 the chancellor have commission from the office for budget responsibility an update economic and fiscal forecast for   march   incorporate the late datum only the obr ’s forecast can accurately predict the effect on the public finance of any change in financial market or the economy and i will not pre empt that forecast there should be no doubt of the government ’s commitment to economic stability and sound public finance that be why meet the fiscal rule be non negotiable 
 may i end by say that i be pleased that the shadow chancellor be hold this government to account on our stewardship of the economy it be important that he do so he will remember when his party crash the economy with unfunded tax cut unrealistic public spending plan and a clear disregard for the consequence on family finance family across the country be still pay the price for the conservative disastrous performance on the economy through high mortgage and bill if there be clear reason why the conservative party suffer such an historic defeat at the last general election it be their performance on the economy that be presumably why the shadow chancellor himself admit in december that the lack of trust in the conservative party ’s management of the economy have leave a deep and painful scar in the pocket of every person across britain 
 let i tell the house what have change in our month this labour government have expose the £ black hole in the public finance not only have we expose it but we have deal with it the   chancellor ’s autumn budget protect work people wipe the slate clean of the mess the conservative party leave the country in and invest in our nhs and school we have give the independent office for budget responsibility enhance power of oversight in law so that we never again get into the situation where that lot leave the country a £ black hole in the public finance we have set tough new fiscal rule that be non negotiable with a budget settlement for public service that they must all live within we have kick start growth in this country this government ’s no mission by unlock investment and bring forward reform such as those to plan and in the mansion house speech 
 may i say to the shadow chancellor that that work stand in stark contrast to the negligent and shameful horror of a circus performance that the conservative party in government unleash on this country only a few year ago until he can come to the house with an apology for the british people i will not take any lecture from the conservative party about how to run the economy 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer 
 the performance we have just see be a slightly anxious and breathless which lead i to the question where be the chancellor it be a bitter regret that at this difficult time and give these serious issue she herself be nowhere to be see 
 in the last hour borrowing cost have reach a year high and it be the chancellor ’s decision that have lead we here before the election the right hon lady promise that labour would get debt fall would not fiddle the figure would not raise taxis and would grow the economy but the economy be now flatline survey after survey be show that business confidence have simply evaporate and at the budget the chancellor hike up taxis increase borrowing by an average of £ a year across the forecast and conveniently adjust her fiscal rule to allow she to do so 
 high debt and low growth be understandably now cause real concern among the public among business and in the market and despite what the chief secretary have say about international factor the premium on our borrowing cost compare with german bond recently hit its high level since with those rise cost regrettably the government may now be on course to breach their fiscal rule the chancellor have commit to no further tax rise so do the right hon gentleman stand by her commitment not to increase taxis even far if so do that mean that the public should expect cut to public service spending if the obr judge that her fiscal headroom have evaporate 
 there be medium report that the chancellor will make an emergency intervention to soothe market but with no confirmation that such a statement will occur in this house will the right hon gentleman confirm that any such statement will be make to member in this house rates on government bond ultimately feed through to the broad credit market so what estimate have the treasury make of how recent market movement will impact mortgage cost and lend across the economy 
 i will make final point mr speaker every pound that we spend on debt interest be money that we can not spend on the public ’s priority the government ’s decision to let rip on borrowing mean that their own tax rise will end up be swallow up by high borrowing cost at no benefit to the british people far from this government lay the foundation for a strong economy the chancellor be squander the endeavour of million of hard work people up and down our country who be now have to pay the price for yet another socialist government tax and spend their way into trouble do the right hon gentleman not now accept that it be time to change course 
 i be pleased that the right hon gentleman enjoy my performance i have not even have my cup of coffee yet this morning let i answer some of his question interruption conservative member might like to listen if the question be so important to they 
 the right hon gentleman ask i about the fiscal rule as i say in my statement those rule be non negotiable as the chancellor set out at the budget we have fiscal rule that day to day spending should be meet by tax receipt and secondly that debt should be fall as a share of the economy 
 the right hon gentleman talk about the debt burden that this country have maybe we should reflect a little on why we have so much debt—[interruption from pre pandemic mr speaker let we look at the burden of debt inherit by this government from the conservatives from onwards why do the last government have to borrow so much money every single month not just to invest but to pay the day to day bill because of an absolute failure to get growth into the economy they could not make the number add up they stack up the country ’s credit card and leave it to the labour party to deal with and we be go to deal with it that be why those fiscal rule be non negotiable and it be why public spending will be within the number set out at the budget 
 we be start the spending review now and it will conclude in june public service will have to live within their mean the chancellor have be very clear about that that be why with this government you get economic stability and absolute clarity on public spending that be why the british people trust this party and boot that lot out of office 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 we all know that fiscal rule and certainty be vital for the market and the good stewardship of the public finance so will the chief secretary to the treasury explain what process he will be go through as he conduct the spending review and what notice he will give to departments about extra cut that they may have to make in order to meet the fiscal rule in addition when the chancellor come in front of the house for the obr forecast in march will she be make a fiscal statement at that point 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for her question as the house know we have start the phase of the spending review to set public   sector budget from onwards the chancellor confirm in a write ministerial statement before the house rise for christmas that there will be a forecast from the obr and a statement on   march as i say in my response that will be the next time the obr will give a view about the uk economy and the level of funding for public service between the obr forecast in march and the conclusion of the spending review in june the house will be update in the normal way 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i recognise that the chancellor have a very difficult job she inherit an economy on its knee follow the conservative mismanagement of the economy from their terrible trade deal—[interruption that extend from their terrible trade deal with europe which be hold back business in wokingham to soar inflation stagnant growth and the liz truss mini budget which hit so many mortgage holder across the country 
 however the government seem to be repeat some of the same mistake last night the treasury issue a statement say that 
 meet the fiscal rule be non negotiable 
 will the chief secretary reassure this house that protect the nhs and care be also non negotiable and will he rule out any cut to those service as the government try to balance the book will he work to repair our tie with europe and cut trade relate red tape especially in the face of donald trump and his oligarch ally such as elon musk 
 i thank the hon member for his question he will note from the prime minister ’s plan for change that the nhs be the subject of of this government ’s key commitment with commitment to get the elective waiting list down and to invest in the national health service so that we can do so he will have hear that from the chancellor at the budget in the autumn and he will see that it be a continued commitment from this government we can do that because of our commitment to the fiscal rule and because of our investment to grow the economy which be the only route to long term sustainable public financing 
 the hon member be very rudely groan at by conservative members but when it come to their performance on the economy it be not they who should be groan but the british people who should be groan at they for what they do to their family finance 
 us bond rate be rise as well as those in the uk with high than expect inflation and interest rate i note that conservative members have not mention that perhaps they have not look the good way to make our debt sustainable be to invest to get growth grow and to get expect inflation down by invest in clean energy do the minister agree that our plan to invest in growth and in low price clean energy be exactly the way to make our debt sustainable 
 my hon friend know very well that this government ’s approach have be about stability investment and reform the stability we have bring follow the chaos of the year under the conservative   party as have be recognise by the british people and by the market the investment we have be unlocking from our global investment summit all the way through to the work we have be do in the budget and since and the reform we be bring forward for example plan reform to make sure we can deliver infrastructure well in this country and unlock the investment that private capital have want to put forward in the uk for many year but could not because of the chaos from the conservatives when they be last in government 
 i call the father of the house 
 on   november the chancellor say 
 we have now set the envelope for spend for this parliament and we be not go to be come back with more tax increase or indeed with more borrowing 
 i be sure because the chancellor be an honourable lady that she will not be open that envelope put her sticky finger inside and come out with more borrowing or tax increase will the minister give an absolute assurance of no more tax increase or borrow 
 i can absolutely assure the father of the house that we be work through this spending review on the basis of the envelope set at the budget public service will have to operate within the mean that we be provide to they the obr forecast will come in march which will give we the late set of information and we will work to that with department this be why we have set up organisation such as the office for value for money why we have set tough productivity and efficiency target for departments and why we be invest in for example technology to improve the productivity of the public service we provide public service must live within their mean as set out in the budget and that be an absolute guarantee from this government 
 i thank the chief secretary for his response i have just sit through transport question or some of they during which i repeatedly hear call for more spending from conservative members but they oppose every single tax rise to pay for that spending do the chief secretary agree that of the lesson from global development in recent day be that we must pay for day to day public spending through tax rise however tough that be 
 i very much agree with my hon friend we have to pay day to day bill with the income we generate day to day the lesson that we learn from the opposition be about what they be happy to do but this government be not they be happy to announce plan and programme to make promise to the british people even though they know they do not have the money to pay for it that will never happen under this labour government 
 when the chancellor set the envelope for spend for this parliament and say to the treasury committee on   november   that she would not come back for more tax increase or more borrowing that be base on her assumption about the cost of borrowing those be manifestly in significant doubt to look at it in the most charitable way i have sit   in the chief secretary ’s position and i know he will want to equivocate and push decision to the next obr assessment and the next fiscal event but the truth be surely this this government have to cut spending increase taxis or borrow more if the cost of borrowing be increase that moment will come soon which of those choice be he inclined to make and when will he tell the british people honestly what this government have do 
 i have be clear to the house as have the chancellor that the fiscal rule be non negotiable public service will have to live within their mean we set the budget in the autumn last year and we have the obr forecast come in march those be the number that department be work to in the spending review and those be the number that we will hold public service to when we conclude the spending review in june 
 we think we know the dire economic situation when the general election be call but on enter government we find the real consequence of the previous tory government ’s addiction to unfunded spending announcement the people of newcastle upon tyne central and west be pay the consequence for the truss kwarteng economic crash with the imminent entry into the white house of a president also commit to significant unfunded tax cut the economic stability of the uk become even more important will my right hon friend confirm that this government be absolutely committed to fiscal responsibility and rise living standard and that the plan for growth will deliver both 
 i thank the chair of the science innovation and technology committee for her question she will know that our commitment in the labour party manifesto at the last election be to fiscal responsibility it be the bedrock of this government and the bedrock of every decision we take as the prime minister set out in his plan for change the reason people will know the difference that a labour government make be that they will have more money in their pocket by the end of this parliament than when it start 
 in yesterday ’s extraordinary emergency statement from the treasury to try to calm the market it pay tribute to the fact that the government inherit the low debt in the g7 be the reason the government front bench be so empty today and the chancellor have flee to china that she have realise that her budget mean she now be the arsonist 
 i must say i be rather surprised by the inflammatory language of the former chair of the treasury committee which be clearly no reflection of reality the chancellor be go on her trip to china it have be well document for many week and it be an important visit for trade and investment in the uk economy may i say that there be no emergency statement or emergency intervention those be make believe word be propagate by opposition members the treasury respond to request from journalist about headroom as we might do in the normal way there be no need for any emergency intervention and there have not be 
 would think from listen to opposition members that they have not crash our economy and preside over high taxis high debt and fall living standard which affect my constituent and i expect some of theirs too interruption that be the tory cycle will the minister confirm that the route out of that be growth and that remain our no mission 
 my hon friend be right may i offer some probably unwelcome advice to opposition member the soon they stop groan and stop laugh about their performance when they be last in government and the soon they apologise for it the soon the british people might start listen to they again 
 public service be at break point after the previous government ’s mishandle of the economy and budget locally however do the minister recognise that scale back investment in vital public service risk even more devastating consequence for our local community 
 at the autumn budget the chancellor invest in frontline public service because we recognise that people rely on they but also because function public service be an important route to growth in the economy if people be sick and can not get to work they need to be able to see a doctor in a timely fashion so that they can get back to work that be the priority of this government as well as invest in modernise our public service so that they be fit for the future 
 my constituent suffer real hardship as a result of the disastrous mini budget pursue by the conservative party do the chief secretary to the treasury agree that in order to improve living standard for my constituent we must stick to our fiscal rule maintain fiscal discipline and invest in our public service 
 i very much agree that be why fiscal stability and economic responsibility be at the heart of this labour government and the chancellor ’s agenda member on the opposition benches may want to pay attention to that 
 there be no point beat around the bush the chancellor have just lose over £ of headroom and stand on the cusp of break her own fiscal rule she say last year that she would not come back for more tax rise will the chief secretary be honest and admit just as the former bank of england rate setter martin weale say today that this leave only the option of more austerity will he level with people about when and where the next round of cut will fall 
 as i say the fiscal rule be non negotiable the only reliable source on future financing will be the obr forecast on   march the conclusion of the spending review in june and the budget which the chancellor will present in the autumn the hon gentleman mention austerity but i remind he that this labour government have give the scottish parliament the large real term increase in funding since devolution he should be grateful for that 
 this labour government have be in power for month and we be have to deal with year of conservative chaos do the chief secretary agree that the government ’s plan for change which aim to provide a stable economy and raise living standard in every part of the united kingdom and have economic growth as the no mission be the right approach to ensure that the united kingdom can weather the global uncertainty that we face 
 my hon friend be absolutely right let i set out the difference that the british people will experience at the end of year of conservative government they have high mortgage high bill a high cost of living and public service on their knee at the end of this labour government point towards the next general election as set out in the prime minister ’s plan for change they will have more money in their pocket public service will be function again and they will be proud once again of their government and of the british economy 
 have listen very carefully to the right hon gentleman ’s response i believe that he be make a more significant statement than many of his colleague might realise by underline that there will not be any tax or borrowing increase he be in effect say that austerity be back because there be no way that the public finance can be remedie by another budget of wishful thinking that pretend that increase borrowing and spending will produce growth that be once again be prove by a labour government to be a false way of lead the economy 
 i be always grateful to the hon gentleman for think that i be make such substantive intervention and for his continued support in that respect this be not austerity as he will know full well austerity be ideological cut to public financing and the size of the state it be cut irrespective of what that mean for public service or for people across the country that be far from what the chancellor unveil in her autumn budget that be the absolute opposite of austerity we increase financing for frontline public service and will continue to do so 
 will the chief secretary outline the step that this government have already take to fix the fiscal foundation and put this country on a strong footing for growth 
 my hon friend ask an important question why do we have to take that action why be this government ’s bill about fiscal responsibility it be because of the mess that conservative members leave this country in that be why we have give the office for budget responsibility strong independent power of oversight in statute something that the shadow chancellor presumably welcome give his comment criticise liz truss and her budget when he be chair of the treasury committee we bring that change forward which the conservative party fail to do that be why we have set fiscal rule that be non negotiable why public service must live within their mean and why the government ’s absolute focus be on secure growth investment reform and long term sustainability for public finance 
 be the chief secretary aware that the last month gdp figure for september and october be both down be he aware that sterling be fall in fact almost collapse confidence be fall and investor be flee the only thing go up be inflation wasteful public spending and the cost of debt be under no illusion we be head towards a financial crisis will he ask the chancellor to return from her ridiculous trip to china to reverse course and to cut daft spending and wasteful regulation so that we can create some growth 
 i think the question be whether i be go to demand that the chancellor come back from her trade trip to china i will not no 
 do the chief secretary agree that there be an irony in the conservatives raise concern about the cost of borrowing when they oversaw debt rise from of gdp to more than of gdp and leave a £ unfunded black hole in public finance and now continue to oppose the tough decision that we be make on tax and spend to fix their mess 
 that be exactly why our fiscal rule be non negotiable while the conservative borrow to pay the bill every month because they do not have enough money to pay for all their promise this government be invest in the future of our country whether through reform public service or invest in infrastructure and opportunity for growth that be exactly the right approach to the economy it be what our fiscal rule demand and what we will be hold to 
 next have say that it will increase price by directly because of the increase to national insurance contribution and have warn of slow growth with business confidence plummeting gilt at a year high and growth stagnate do the government still maintain that they have an iron grip on public finance or will they admit that their budget have do exactly what the conservatives warn increase cost increase price and reduce growth 
 the question be whether the government have an iron grip on public finance the answer be yes 
 meur ras ha myttin da mr speaker do the chief secretary agree that the only way that we can wrest the economy out of the clutch of the conservatives doom loop be to go for growth the government ’s new industrial strategy will be a core foundation underpin that growth 
 my hon friend be absolutely right our industrial strategy through which we will invest alongside business and industry of the future and our infrastructure strategy which set out how we will get britain build again be example of the government play their part by bring economic and political stability by for example reform the planning system we will unlock billion of pound of private sector investment in uk plc something that do not happen under the previous government 
 i completely sympathise with the chief secretary about the incredible brass neck of the official opposition he talk about kick start growth but can he give we any evidence that growth have be kick start do he not realise that the only way to kick start growth in the near future be to re engage with europe 
 the hon gentleman will know that this government ’s approach to stimulate growth in the economy be about stability investment and reform the political and economic stability the chancellor have bring to this country the investment from private sector partner as well as from the state where appropriate and the reform of policy area such as the planning system or the financial service reform that the chancellor set out in her mansion house speech he be also right of course that we need to improve our trading relationship with country around the world which be why the chancellor be go to china today and why we have begin negotiation with our friend in the european union on how we can improve our relationship on a whole host of issue include trade energy defence and security 
 do the chief secretary agree that the conservatives have add gutter politic to their fantasy economic and unfunded spending commitment can no long call themselves the party of decency in public life and of sound money 
 yes 
 it be deeply disappointing that the chancellor be not here to answer question in the house on such an important topic so i shall have to ask my question to the chief secretary to the treasury instead it be quite a simple will he stand by the chancellor ’s comment that she will not come back with more tax increase 
 i be sorry to disappoint the right hon member but i will answer the question none the less she ask i whether i stand by the chancellor ’s statement and the answer be yes 
 i want we to get serious for a minute here interruption many of my constituent in north east derbyshire who will have just hear the guffawing from the opposition have be really struggle with the cost of living crisis they vote the government in and we be commit to restore the foundation of our economy will the minister assure i that we be do everything we can to deliver on that promise 
 it be absolutely right that the labour government be bring fiscal and economic stability back to this country because we know that when you play fast and loose with the nation ’s finance you play fast and loose with family finance that be what voter in every constituency experience when the conservatives be last in government they will not experience that under this labour government 
 we be look at high interest rate low growth and a high cost of borrow to the government as my hon and right hon friend have say we be grateful to   the chief secretary to the treasury for be so honest with the house it be clear that if he stick to his word there will not be any more borrowing or any more tax rise give the number that leave only option cut in public service i wonder whether his colleague behind he on the government benches realise that reality what word other than austerity will he use to describe it 
 as i have say it seem that the conservative party be proud of its record on austerity we do not support austerity which be blind ideological cut to public services—3 cut irrespective of the outcome for the people who rely on public service the chancellor increase investment in public service at the budget in the autumn and we will continue to increase investment in they because we need to get they back on their foot and they be an important foundation for economic growth i be pleased that the right hon gentleman recognise my statement and say that they be honest because of course they be i look forward to come back to the house in future month and year to show he the progress that the government be make 
 it be a relief for i and my constituent in doncaster central that we finally have a labour government provide economic stability and invest in the industry of the future interruption it be all right for conservative members to chunter but after the mess they make a period of silence on their part be warrant will my right hon friend lie out the action that he will take to ensure that all region of the country include place like doncaster and south yorkshire benefit from growth 
 my hon friend be right to point out that the government be in the service of work people what do that mean it mean that people ’s life the money they have in their pocket and the ability to pay the bill get a roof over their head and seek opportunity be at the very heart of what it mean to be in the labour party and in this labour government conservative members might not have suffer from high mortgage bill or worry about the cost of live during their supermarket shop each month but people across the country do and they suffer as a consequence of the conservatives behaviour i welcome my hon friend ’s comment that they should have a period of silence while they learn the lesson 
 i think that i hear the chief secretary say that the chancellor have not go to china will he confirm that she be still plan to go secondly if she have not go to china yet why be she not here lot of people would like to hear from she thirdly have the chancellor talk to the governor of the bank of england about market turbulence at any point in the last day 
 the chancellor be go to china as have be well document again i be sorry that it disappoint the hon member that i be here i refer he and his colleague to the urgent question which be about a statement on borrowing cost and public finance he will know that i be the minister for public finance which be why i be here answer his question 
 will the chief secretary to the treasury confirm that the government ’s no mission be still growth that be the only way that we can break out of the tory inheritance of low growth high borrowing high taxis and squeeze living standard for people in my constituency in livingston and across the uk
