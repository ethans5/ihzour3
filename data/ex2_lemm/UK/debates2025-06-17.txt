accord to keep britain tidy litter and fly tipping cost the country £ a year do my hon friend agree that that be money that could go to frontline service so it be about time we take more stringent measure to change behaviour along with some good enforcement 
 as we have hear the bill be broad in scope before i turn to the couple of amendment that i support i want to recognise that the bill ’s scope be evidence by the breadth and number of amendment and new clause it be worth gently remind ourselves that a number of the measure be carry over from the criminal justice bill which sadly fall due to the general election almost a year ago though there be obviously new clause and amendment i hope the minister be in listen mode in change mode and be willing to work across the house and i hope that she accept some of these amendment because they would go a long way to far improve this legislation 
 i have read through the bill and much of it go right to the heart of the community we seek to serve and represent there be topic in the bill that regularly pop up in my inbox and i be sure into colleague inboxe as well i want to cover specific area the be fly tipping and littering an issue that i have speak about on many occasion in this chamber since i be elect i support the amendment and new clause table by the shadow minister my hon friend   the member for stockton west matt vickers 
 in an intervention early i touch on the cost of litter to the country i think i say that it be £ but i mean £ i hope that can be firmly   correct because it be a big difference the principle be the same it be money that could go back into our community but £ spend on manage litter and fly tipping be a huge amount of money that could otherwise buy a huge amount of service for constituency up and down the country 
 i want to start by align myself with and commend the speech of my hon friend the members for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge for ribble valley maya ellis for monmouthshire catherine fookes for gower tonia antoniazzi and for walthamstow ms creasy i be proud to stand alongside my colleague and be proud to listen to what they have to say today and because of what they have to say today i have less to say which will allow more people to speak 
 i have be send here by my constituent to defend and further their right to safe and illegal abortion my inbox have be inundate with message from constituent who be concern and who want to be able to have safe and legal abortion they want to be remove from the criminal justice system as my hon friend the member for gower say because we have situation where clinically vulnerable woman who have go through some of the bad experience that anybody can go through will in some case be arrest straight from the hospital ward hurry to cell and make to feel unmitigated level of shame and guilt on top of the physical and mental trauma they have already experience 
 reading oppose and defer until   tuesday june   standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent progress his department have make on tackle the backlog of repair in hospital 
 what step his department be take to tackle building maintenance backlog in the nhs estate 
 the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend   the member for west lancashire ashley dalton send her apology due to a family issue she be very much in our thought today 
 thank to the decision take by my right hon friend the chancellor at the spending review health capital budget will increase to £ by the end of the spending review period that will deliver the large ever health capital budget in nhs history across this settlement more than £ will be invest to address the most critical building repair reduce the most serious and critical infrastructure risk and rebuild the broken nhs leave by the conservatives 
 while i welcome the recent announcement of £ of extra funding for epsom and st helier   university hospital nhs trust it be quite frankly a drop in the ocean in comparison with the scale of need because the current backlog at the trust cost £ patient and staff deserve safe and modern facility not patchwork repair i therefore ask the secretary of state to meet with i and visit epsom and st helier hospital to see at hand the scale of the challenge and how we can accelerate progress 
 i absolutely appreciate the challenge that the hon member describe have meet with the trust myself the minister for secondary care my hon friend   the member for bristol south karin smyth   and i have both meet with local mp about the challenge face epsom and st helier lord darzi ’s investigation find that the conservatives leave a £ black   hole in nhs capital we be reverse that trend with the large ever capital budget for health the £ for epsom and st helier trust for estate safety be in addition to the £ of capital that the nhs south west london integrate care board be receive include for maintenance backlog it will take time but brick by brick labour be rebuild our nhs 
 the imperial college healthcare nhs trust have the large high risk repair backlog in the country the support from the government estate safety fund be very welcome but to solve this problem we ultimately need a new st mary ’s hospital will the secretary of state join i in praise the work of the new year st mary ’s taskforce which aim to get to full planning consent and explore different financing model so that we can finally get this hospital build 
 i thank my hon friend for the work that he and my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake   be lead in partnership with the trust and westminster city council to ensure that the people of his constituency have the hospital they deserve as he know this will be the most complicated scheme in the new hospital programme but that be no excuse for the year of delay that the scheme have face the trust now boast the big high risk repair backlog in the country so my hon friend be right to ensure that this be not allow to be put in the too difficult pile again we look forward to engage constructively and do everything that we can to expedite the progress that be desperately need for his community and our city 
 what step he be take to support rural pharmacy 
 what step his department be take to support community pharmacy 
 after year of underfunding the government agree a record uplift of £ for for the pharmacy sector the pharmacy access scheme provide £ to support pharmacy in area with few pharmacy include in rural area but funding must always come with reform our hub and speak legislation if it be pass in the other place today will allow pharmacy to streamline their dispense process and it be a major step in the right direction in marry reform with investment 
 i recently visit modbury pharmacy where owner phil dawes highlight the challenge face small rural pharmacy he explain how the current funding model do not take into account the low footfall and limited referral rate that be common in rural area we know that if a pharmacy in a small market town close it can cause extreme difficulty for people to access advice and medicine particularly where there be little or no public transport and they have to go a long way will the government consider introduce rural exception or adjusted funding threshold so that we can keep community pharmacy open 
 the pharmacy sector be face huge challenge after massive cut over the past year we be begin to rebuild but the hon lady be right that there be particular challenge for rural pharmacy we be look at comprehensive reform in the pharmacy sector involve the well use of technology hub and speak dispensing and a range of other option that would enable well remote dispensing for rural pharmacy 
 i have visit pharmacy across my constituency they be all struggle to provide a service but be all very keen to take on the new service that the nhs be suggest will the minister commit to ensure that rural and community pharmacy be properly staff and equip to deliver those community service such as diabete testing and weight management treatment so that patient be not leave behind just because of where they live 
 the hon lady be right that pharmacy will play a central role in the shift from hospital to community that we will be put at the heart of our year plan an important part of that of course be pharmacy the take up of pharmacy be not what we would like it to be so we be look at option to increase awareness of pharmacy and to free up pharmacist to be able to operate at the top of their licence part of that be about streamline the dispense side of what they do and the hub and speak legislation that i mention early will be really important in that context 
 the minister have speak many time about the importance of shift from hospital to the community i have visit many local pharmacy and meet the chair of community pharmacy nottinghamshire see at hand the important work they do to support community in mansfield do the minister agree that community pharmacy have a key role to play in that shift and could help to take pressure off gp surgery 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and i commend he for the work he be do in his constituency include with pharmacy in many way what we want to see be a culture change because the interface between general practice and community pharmacy be not where it should be we believe that pharmacist have a huge amount more to offer but that require a well digital interface and well information sharing a single patient record that sort of vehicle will be really important for deliver some of those reform 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be pleased to hear the minister speak about pharmacy which be bring forward by the previous government and welcome by community the public and the pharmacist although i be pleased to see the government continue it why have they decide to cap the number of consultation that a pharmacist may do 
 part of that be about the financial arrangement for pharmacy which need to be set at a level that incentivise pharmacist sadly give the   way in which the scheme be set up under the previous government those incentive be not work which be reason why the take up of pharmacy have not be what it need to be it be a question not of cap but much more of get the right level of financial compensation for pharmacy so that it work and incentivise the system 
 i be grateful to the minister for his answer but part of the problem be that once pharmacist hit that cap they be no long pay the £ per consultation in turn that mean that either patient will be turn away or the pharmacist must take the hit and pay for it themselves that disjoin the system and could create extra cost because patient who be turn away will turn up in other area of primary care such as their gp surgery how do that fit with darzi ’s push towards community base service 
 the hon gentleman will have see and i be sure will welcome the record uplift of £ that we be put into the pharmacy sector after year of underfunding incompetence and neglect from the conservative party a big part of this be ensure that the shift from hospital to community take place and we want pharmacist to be take pressure off primary care we have to make pharmacy work effectively which mean get the allocation of fund right that be what we be work on in term of reform now that we have the spending review and the package that be what we will be deliver 
 if he will undertake a review of the potential impact of medicine supply chain shortage on community pharmacy 
 increase the resilience of the uk medical supply chain be a key priority i regularly meet the team to routinely take action to mitigate supply issue include request additional stock identify alternative global source and issue management advice although the department have no plan to conduct a specific review we constantly work to identify and take forward further action to reduce the impact of medicine shortage include target winter monitoring 
 have work in community pharmacy for nearly year i have witness at hand the pain that medicine shortage can cause north somerset patient and their loved one will the minister meet i along with my hon friend   the member for exeter steve race   and other member of the all party parliamentary group on pharmacy to discuss the outcome of our inquiry into these shortage 
 i congratulate my hon friend and constituency neighbour on his dedicated career in community pharmacy and thank he for the expertise that he bring to the work of the all party parliamentary group to help member understand the impact of this issue on patient and pharmacy i be plan to hold a parliamentary event on the subject in the autumn and i be keen to work with the appg to make it a success for all member 
 supply chain problem be just of the many issue that be have an impact on community pharmacy my local pharmacy in noak bridge be of they but it be also be hammer with national insurance increase and the combination of these issue mean that its long term viability be at stake will the review that the minister have mention include all the impact on community pharmacy that be affect their long term viability 
 the long term viability of pharmacy and indeed the whole nhs be under threat from the right hon gentleman and his party but thank to this government it be be make fit for the future this be a serious issue for all our constituent and we want to make the system work well the right hon gentleman will see from the year plan that we will make the nhs fit for his constituent mine and those of every other member 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 across the country community pharmacy struggle not only with supply chain problem but with dispense some of the critical medicine for our constituent at a loss i be concerned to read that high price for united states pharmaceutical be on the table for the next stage of trade negotiation with donald trump because an additional £ would cost both the nhs and our community pharmacy dear what step be the department take to ensure that the nhs and the vital medicine supply on which we rely will not be use as a bargaining chip in a trade deal with a highly unreliable us president 
 the hon lady have ask an important question about the pharmaceutical industry which be key to the country ’s growth mission and to support all our constituent and the entire country as we know my right hon friend the prime minister be currently attend the g7 summit we have good relationship with america and the department be work closely across government to ensure that the same stability of supply remain for our constituent 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of expand the additional role reimbursement scheme to include gps 
 what step he be take to improve access to gps 
 the government inherit a ludicrous situation whereby patient could not get a gp appointment and gps could not get a job so of my act be to cut red tape to give practice flexibility to hire gps along with an extra £ investment thank to that combination of investment and reform this government have recruit an additional gps to the frontline since july exceed our target of we have invest an extra £ in general practice   this year take action to bring back the family doctor we do not pretend to have solve all the problem but change have begin and the good be still to come 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to restore the family doctor and the recruitment of additional gps nationwide but my constituency have yet to benefit from that concern have be express to i about the expansion of the additional role reimbursement scheme to include only newly qualified gps which it be fear may be too restrictive i have meet local gp partner who share that concern so will the secretary of state meet we to discuss how the scheme can well support area such as mine 
 we be invest an extra £ in general practice and have reform the gp contract to help bring back the family doctor and end the am scramble that contract reform include further change to make it easy to recruit gps through the scheme as my hon friend will see shortly when we publish the year plan for health general practice be at the heart of our proposal to build a neighbourhood health service i be keen to work with she and with gps to make it even easy to ensure that qualified gps can get job and patient can get gp appointment and i should be delighted to meet she 
 after year of the conservatives run down the frontline of the nhs many people in basingstoke still struggle to gain access to their gps issue that patient and gps raise time and again be the lack of capital investment in new provision to meet grow housing need chineham medical practice for example be build to serve just patient but now serve more than and be set to serve many thousand more in the year to come what more be the government do to enable every patient in basingstoke to see their gp when they need to 
 my hon friend be absolutely right just as this government be deliver record home building with a huge target to build the home that britain need we also need to ensure that people get the local service that they deserve that be exactly why this government have invest an extra £ this year to create additional clinical space in over gp practice which will create new consultation room and make well use of exist space to deliver more appointment i know the chineham medical practice be of the practice put forward by its integrate care board for funding so i hope we will see that practice benefit from this investment in the near future as we rebuild our nhs 
 the government ’s additional role reimbursement scheme lead to just new gps for my constituent in wokingham which be a drop in the ocean more need to be do to deliver gp practice in new development such as arborfield in south wokingham why do ministers not support the liberal democrat amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill that would have make commitment to build gp surgery in all new housing development legally bind 
 probably because be that prescriptive about every housing development be not sensible even if the thrust of what the hon member describe that as new housing development be build we need to ensure that local infrastructure go alongside it be the right approach i take what he say about the number of gps and as i have say we do not pretend to have fix all the problem in month but with respect those be more gps than be there before i know there be more to do but give i time and we will rebuild general practice for his constituent and anyone else ’s 
 access to gps in my constituency of chichester be be undermine by the closure of the westbourne branch of emsworth medical practice at the end of this month patient will now have to travel to emsworth but we be talk about a small rural village and there be no public transport to get my elderly and vulnerable patient to that medical practice over the border will the secretary of state please meet i to urgently discuss how we can protect this vital service in a rural village in chichester 
 i can well understand the hon member ’s concern and her constituent concern practice closure be hard on community wherever they be but they disproportionately hit rural community and those that suffer with poor transport connectivity i would urge she in the instance to raise the specific local issue with the icb however i reassure she and other right hon and hon member that the need of rural coastal and remote community be very much in our mind and crucially in the year plan and our thinking about how we build genuine neighbourhood health service in all type of neighbourhood 
 what step his department plan to take to ensure mental health service be fully staff in rural area 
 i know this be an important issue for the hon member from the meeting we have about it last year this government be support local provider by recruit an additional mental health worker by the end of this parliament we be also expand nhs talk therapy and pilot new neighbourhood mental health centre include hope haven serve whitehaven and rural copeland 
 i thank the minister for his reply but this month the care quality commission find high level of staff vacancy in the already understaffe psychiatric intensive care unit and acute mental health ward in south cumbria conclude that this be put patient safety at risk yet worryingly the icb in south cumbria be make additional cut of £ this year with north cumbria also make cut in the light of that what be his plan to intervene to ensure that mental health staffing in cumbria be increase to safe level 
 i thank the hon member for that there be no doubt that the nhs university and other need to do more to get student trainee and qualified doctor and mental health specialist in place where   the nhs and patient need they we will publish a refreshed workforce plan later this year to ensure that the nhs have the right people in the right place to care for patient when they need it 
 the snp have cut mental health service across scotland while fail to recruit the necessary workforce in rural community such as those in stirling and strathallan what assessment have the department make of how devolved mismanagement of mental health service be affect outcome for patient in rural scotland 
 if we be to make an assessment of the way in which the snp have mismanage its responsibility in scotland we would be here for a very long time i be not sure i can answer my hon friend ’s question in the round but i be sure that colleague from the snp will be welcome the record investment that the uk government have make in scotland i be certainly look forward to the improved outcome that they will be deliver as a result 
 what recent step he have take to support the health of the elderly 
 the spending review announce increase in nhs spending alongside more money for adult social care by invest in dexa scanner we can more rapidly treat condition such as osteoporosis which particularly affect elderly woman our urgent and emergency care plan promote fall prevention technology for long independent living and few hospital admission gps be now incentivise to improve continuity of care benefit patient with long term condition 
 i thank the minister for his reply but as the secretary of state know only too well my borough of havering contain of the high number of elderly people in the entire london region yet queen ’s hospital in romford remain chronically underfunde overstretch and struggle to meet the grow healthcare need of an age community will the minister commit today to the serious investment that queen ’s hospital so desperately require to ensure well health outcome for old people across romford 
 i carefully note the fact that the secretary of state for health and social care who be sit next to i have an interest in this issue so i will tread very carefully with my answer i understand that the hon gentleman have discuss this matter with the minister for secondary care the north east london health and care partnership integrate care board be responsible for delivery implementation and funding decision for local service but the hon gentleman ’s representation have be carefully note today not least by the secretary of state for health 
 of the most important thing we can do to support the health of the elderly be to ensure that they can get to see their local doctor it be great to hear the health secretary talk   about the improve access to appointment we be see that in chesterfield but he be also right to say that it be the step back up the mountain the government inherit a real crisis in gp access and the situation be particularly difficult in more deprive area will my hon friend tell i what more we will do to ensure that people be able to see a gp and in particular that practice that serve the most deprived community can get access to the extra gps they need 
 my hon friend will know that when we come into government we inherit the absurd situation where the additional role reimbursement scheme be weigh down by red tape and it be not actually possible to recruit gps we change that we invest an extra £ and as a result we have well over more gps on the frontline but that be just the beginning we have contract reform and £ of additional investment in general practice and we be move forward with an online booking system which will be obligatory by   october we have much more work to do for example around the interface with pharmacy we be work hard on that there be a lot more to do but my hon friend be right that the step up the mountain have be take 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last health question i ask about delay to crucial medication in a&e and the secretary of state say he be interested to hear more but his office say he would delegate it to a minister and we still have not be offer a date so could i encourage he to look into that please the u turn on winter fuel will help the elderly to stay warm and healthy this winter but another way to help elderly people would be to protect they from the respiratory syncytial virus will the government extend the vaccination to the over-80s 
 i thank the hon lady for that question but i do not quite catch the word she use the virus be call interruption oh rsv yes we be certainly look at increase the coverage of the rsv vaccination i do not have the statistic to hand at the moment but i would be happy to write to she on that point 
 many of those on waiting list be elderly and have chronic condition rather than see consultant at regular interval which may coincide with they be relatively well they be often keep on open appointment so that they can call when they be ill this be efficient and responsive care be the minister aware that this provision be be stop in some area in order to improve figure i will quote from a letter about an elderly patient 
 i regret can not keep he on my waiting list under the open appointment 
 for treatment and 
 i have explain the politic of everything and where we be at 
 be re refer to a gp each time be expensive and a waste of time can the minister explain why doctor be be ask to make decision for political reason instead of clinical one 
 i do not think any decision be be make for political reason our medical and health staff be very much focused on do the right thing from a clinical point of view the hon lady raise an important point about continuity of care with people constantly have to be re refer into the system part of the reason for that be the utter incompetence with which the previous government manage our primary care system which have result in people be pass from pillar to post the additional role reimbursement scheme not actually be about have gps on the frontline but about have other staff which create more friction in the system and poor continuity of care this government be go to bring back the family doctor that be the way to get our general practice back on its foot 
 what step his department be take to tackle wasteful spending in the nhs 
 what step his department be take to tackle wasteful spending in the nhs 
 this government be deliver record investment in our nhs but that investment be draw from taxpayer and we have a responsibility to every taxpayer in the land as well as to patient to ensure that every single penny be well spend that be why that investment be match with bold reform so that we get as much value as possible for every penny the abolition of nhs england will slash duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy and i be pleased to report to the house that we have slash spending on agency staff by almost £ compare with last year all those saving be be reinveste into frontline care 
 from speak to my local nhs trust in gateshead i know the value it place on drive cost down but it still face financial pressure key among those be issue relate to the digital capital gap we be really keen in gateshead to improve that situation and to allow more people to access the nhs remotely will the secretary of state meet i and gateshead nhs trust to talk about how we can tackle that 
 i would be delighted to do so my hon friend be absolutely right we have to ensure that the nhs be not only benefit from but at the forefront of the revolution take place in digital service and medical technology it be key to drive productivity and financial sustainability that be why at the spending review the chancellor announce that we would invest up to £ in nhs technology and digital transformation unlike our predecessor we will not raid tech budget to plug shortfall in day to day spending just this month we announce the modernisation of the nhs app so that patient can receive test result and book appointment save £ in stamp envelope and letter 
 i thank the secretary of state for his early reply in scotland there be more quango than msp after year and £ of taxpayer cash down the drain the snp have scrap its plan for   a national care service its flagship policy which be see as a significant setback for scottish social care reform and now we have people go to the pub in chauffeur drive ministerial car will the secretary of state advise his scottish counterpart on how to stop waste scottish taxpayer money 
 give the state of the nhs in scotland i suspect my counterpart need to go and drown his sorrow the truth be that the long the snp be in government the long the nhs in scotland be on the road to nowhere the snp be now on its health plan in year thank to the decision take by the chancellor it be not just the nhs in england that be receive record investment but the scottish government i have use that investment to cut waiting list by almost a quarter of a people the same could be true in scotland if the scottish people boot out the snp and elect anas sarwar and jackie baillie to deliver the change that scotland ’s nhs need 
 a good way to save money in the nhs be to invest in palliative and end of life care because it avert cost that would otherwise go into the acute sector include into ambulance however this government be take money from that sector through their national insurance rise give that integrate care board be suppose to commission palliative care will the secretary of state commit in the year health plan to a proper revenue funding model for hospice and for a minimum service specification for palliative care 
 i can reassure the hon member that end of life care be feature in the year plan for health i also recognise the pressure on our hospice sector which be why this government as well as deliver £ through the child ’s hospice grant commit £ of capital investment the big in a generation for our hospice none the less hospice do rely on the generosity of donor and i be keen to work in partnership with the sector to look at what more we can do to encourage investment the final thing i would say be that the opposition party welcome the investment in the national health service while oppose the mean of raise it they can not have it both way either they support the investment and the revenue raiser or they have to be honest with the public that they would be cut the nhs 
 of the most egregious example of waste in recent year be the almost £ spend on useless personal protective equipment during the pandemic when the treasury eventually recover some of that money will the secretary of state assure i that scottish taxpayer will benefit in the usual way through the usual channel 
 fiscal decision and spending be matter for my right hon friend the chancellor but let i reassure the hon gentleman of thing the way in which the taxpayer of this country be rip off during a national emergency be a total disgrace and this government be determined to get our money back and reinvest it in frontline service where it should always have be secondly i can reassure he that so   long as there be a labour government here in westminster scotland will continue to benefit from the investment it need to sort out its public service now it just need a labour government in scotland to spend that money wisely 
 what step he be take to help reduce waiting time in a&e department 
 this government be commit to fix the nhs and reduce a&e waiting time our new urgent and emergency care plan be back by nearly £ of investment to deliver new urgent treatment centre mental health assessment centre and almost new ambulance alongside that investment we be reform urgent and emergency care so that more patient be treat at the scene or in their home where appropriate which be well for they and will help to unclog a&e department lot have be do but there be much more to do 
 the minister for secondary care recently visit my constituency and see the pressure that newham hospital a&e be under that be partly due to the pressure leave by the previous conservative government and partly due to capacity issue result from a massive growth in population in the borough further pressure will come as we regenerate the massive area of brownfield site in the royal docks can the secretary of state reassure my constituent that as well as the excellent work be do on day to day capacity we will be look at infrastructure over the long term to make sure that we be not only deal with the growth that we have have but future proofing for the population growth to come 
 i know that my hon friend the minister for secondary care enjoy her visit and i thank the staff at newham hospital for the work they do which also benefit my constituent we need to make sure that we be support hospital across our country to meet need because we be part of a wide ecosystem i notice that that point be also powerfully make by   the hon member for romford andrew rosindell   in his question my hon friend   the member for west ham and beckton james asser   be right to raise increase demand and pressure which be why we will shortly publish our year plan for health i be happy to report that whipps cross and newham hospital have also be provisionally allocate £ this year to improve building and estate 
 the government continue to claim that they wish to expand community diagnostic centre to speed up scanning and treatment of patient and therefore reduce demand on the like of a&e. if that be the case why be they cut the revenue tariff that be available to the community diagnostic centre under the previous conservative government which have already impact the financial viability of the cdc and access for patient 
 i think the hon gentleman will find that since this government come to power we have reduce the size of nhs waiting list by a quarter of a nhs waiting list be come down late figure show that this be the time in year that waiting list have fall in the month of april so we be make progress not least thank to the investment that we be put into community diagnostic centre the hon gentleman have some brass neck to complain about nhs service under this government when we be clean up the mess that the previous government leave behind 
 it would also help to extend the hour at chorley a&e. 
 whether his department have make an assessment of the effectiveness of the ban on the use of sunbed by under-18s 
 the sunbeds regulation act ban the use of commercial sunbed for under-18s require business to prevent under age use the department have commission the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment to review the act include the effectiveness of the under-18 ban 
 accord to cancer research uk of melanoma skin cancer case be preventable my constituent charlotte who have stage melanoma be lead a campaign alongside melanoma focus to get well enforcement for the ban on sunbed for under-18s and to stop the use of harmful melanotan ii product such as tan nasal spray and injection for under-35s just session on the sunbed be enough uv exposure to increase the risk of melanoma to prevention be well than cure will the minister meet we to discuss the effectiveness of the ban and preventive measure such as access to free sunscreen at event 
 as someone who be diagnose myself with an early stage melanoma i really commend the work of my hon friend ’s constituent i never use sunbed and i spend holiday in my youth in ireland so i never see much sun either sorry to the irish tourism board as my hon friend say it be an overwhelmingly preventable cancer include by use sunscreen well clothing shading and no sunbed it be up to event organiser to provide sunscreen at event but my hon friend be right i want to personally thank melanoma focus for the support it give i during my diagnosis there be great charity out there to support people i be sure a minister will be in contact with my hon friend and her constituent soon to highlight the prevention aspect of this disease 
 until his recent death my constituent luke webster have live with alternate hemiplegia of childhood his life be short and he spend much of it be move between different care facility to the frustration of his family at such facility luke be abuse will the minister meet i and luke ’s mother to discuss improved safeguard 
 order i do not think this be relevant to sun tanning let we move on 
 what step he be take to reduce waiting time for biopsy result 
 more patient be now get world lead testing technology in the nhs as part of our mission to revolutionise cancer care in this country the government be spend £ a year in capital on diagnostic include for the time funding for the automation of histopathology laboratory to improve productivity we be also fund pathology network to reach digital maturity by which will reduce unnecessary wait and repeat test 
 my constituent julian notice that he have a mole on his chest that be grow and bleed member of his family have die from skin cancer so he be very concerned and go to his gp he be refer to the kent integrate dermatology service and be tell that the result would come back in week they come back in week i know that this issue be of personal concern to the minister so would she please investigate what happen and write to i 
 the hon member raise an awful case on behalf of his constituent of course our targeting of waiting list include diagnostic what happen in that case should not happen anywhere and i will ensure that he get a response as soon as possible 
 what step his department be take to reduce the time take for cancer diagnosis 
 what step his department be take to reduce the time take for cancer diagnosis 
 reduce waiting time for cancer diagnosis remain a key priority under this government an extra patient have have cancer diagnose or rule out this have be support by investment include in cancer a digital innovation that bring patient datum into central platform and in nhs england ’s cancer innovation open call to fast track cutting edge intervention into practice our forthcoming national cancer plan will set out how we will speed up cancer diagnosis even far 
 our labour government have recently invest in a new state of the art linear accelerator machine in southend hospital the machine be the of its type in the country and will drastically improve cancer treatment please can the minister outline how record level of investment such as in the linac machine and as announce at the spending review will finally mean that the nhs will be there when we need it 
 i be delighted that my hon friend ’s constituent will benefit from the £ investment these machine be game change and will reduce the number of visit for his constituent they be also   more reliable which give more capacity to the system that be well for staff as there will be less appointment cancellation that be exactly the sort of thing we want to see more of and we be deliver that under this government it be the result of our drive to reduce long wait and treat more people quicker that be reinforce in last week ’s spending review and it be exactly what his constituent deserve 
 early diagnosis of less survivable cancer be vital if survival rate be to improve what assessment have the department make of the report by the all party parliamentary group on less survivable cancer that look at early detection and fast diagnosis and what step be the department take to deliver on this 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that issue i commend her great work not just on the appg but on lead the health and social care committee on behalf of its chair   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran she be right to highlight that it be a priority for the government to diagnose cancer early and improve survival rate that be particularly important for the group of people with rare cancer the appg ’s report will inform the development of our national cancer plan which will seek to include all aspect of care throughout the entirety of the cancer pathway 
 part of a successful cancer journey be swift cancer treatment as well as swift diagnosis my constituent catherine be diagnose last year with stage breast cancer she have a mastectomy and go through chemotherapy she be then mean to begin a course of radiotherapy in december but as of may that still have not begin what can the department do to ensure that those unacceptable delay do not happen and life can be save 
 many hon member across the house rightly highlight the actual experience of people throughout the entire pathway we have hear about the investment we be make in machine and in staff to ensure on exactly this point that people get not just that fast diagnosis that be so important particularly if cancer be rule out but fast care across the entire pathway the majority of people on waiting list be on they for diagnostic which be exactly why we be invest more in capital and invest in staff to ensure that the process be quick and well for patient if the hon member want to write to i about any particular issue i will obviously respond to she 
 every minute someone in yorkshire be tell that they have cancer tomorrow i will be launch a report for yorkshire cancer research which be base in my constituency that will set out key recommendation will the minister meet we to talk about how we can feed they into the national cancer plan 
 the work that the hon member be do locally with that group be essential i will ensure that we have a good response for he whether it be meet i or a colleague 
 what step he be take to shift care from hospital into the community 
 we be get the nhs back on its foot and make it fit for the future by shift care to the community with £ more for gps additional frontline gps extra urgent dental appointment annually and a uplift to the community pharmacy contract look to the future our commitment to build a neighbourhood health service be right at the heart of our year plan 
 i be delighted by the government ’s commitment to move healthcare close to the community include through the establishment of neighbourhood health centre that be exactly what we need in aylesbury and i be pleased that all our key healthcare provider include the nhs trust and several gp practice be already work together to well integrate their care which be an important step in the right direction will the minister update i on his progress towards the model of neighbourhood base healthcare can he advise what more aylesbury ’s healthcare provider can do to ensure that my resident benefit from the government ’s work in this area 
 it be really good to hear about the fantastic work go on in my hon friend ’s constituency we be work with system to move to a neighbourhood health model by build on exist good practice particularly around the development of multidisciplinary team aylesbury be an outstanding example of that ahead of the year health plan ’s publication local community can continue to make progress by utilise the neighbourhood health guideline that be publish back in january 
 dental patient with untreated need end up in hospital in place like hedon in my constituency we have see more and more dental practice move away from the nhs i have a constituent who find it take she year to get her child their check up and that dental practice have now cease to look after nhs patient she also can not get the nhs treatment she deserve herself even though she have a child in february what in the year plan will change that and ensure that everyone can get access to nhs dentistry 
 the right hon member be right to point to child ’s dental health after we win the election in july i look across my portfolio and it be pretty much a car crash in every aspect thank to the incompetence of previous government perhaps the most shocking statistic of all be that the big reason to year old child be admit to hospital be to have their rotten tooth remove that be a dickensian state of affair we be work with the british dental association on contract reform we have get to incentivise nhs dentistry do away with the false economy set up under the last government and get dentistry back to where it need to be 
 the saying go that it take a village to raise a baby mean that those in our community provide family with vital support do the minister agree that we need to invest in more community midwife to ensure that family be properly support through the whole of pregnancy and after birth 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question the role that midwive play alongside other community health service such as district nurse have be chronically underfunde and neglect over the past year she will be pleased to know that the role of community healthcare be front and centre in our year plan and i think she will be interested in and please with what she see when that plan be publish 
 the darzi report point out that of hospital bed be occupy by people who be fit for discharge but who can not get out because social care be break lord darzi say that we can not fix the nhs until we fix social care it be nearly month since the secretary of state promise cross party talk and a commission but the talk be cancel and never reschedule and the commission be delay please when will the government stop go slow on social care please when can we all get around the table to talk about fix social care so that everyone get the care they deserve 
 i have to correct the hon lady the commission be up and run baroness casey have start meeting and she have a roundtable just a few week ago with people who have live experience the hon lady be therefore not correct on that point and i be sure that she will want to correct the record 
 on the point about delay discharge the hon lady be absolutely right we be reform the well care fund to get much well interface between hospital care and local authority that system and those relationship can and should work much well but there be press long term challenge we be conscious of that and be work at pace with baroness casey to ensure that those reform be deliver 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as we have just hear it be widely acknowledge that the crisis in social care be a cause of dangerously high occupancy rate in hospital that lead to the horror of corridor care the dreadful ambulance wait time that we have see and a knock on effect on the community when i be contact by the family of a terminally ill man in wem in my constituency last month i be remind that not only be care often provide in the wrong place but it be often not available at all will the government bring forward the timeline for the horribly delay casey review to report back get it do this year and heed liberal democrat call for cross party talk so that we can agree on a long term solution for the crisis 
 may i just tackle the idea that we be not work at pace on these issue we have have the unpaid carer ’s uplift from £ to £ which be the big uplift in carer ’s allowance since the 1970 when the policy be bring in hundred of million of   pound uplift in the disabled facility grant and groundbreake legislation for a fair pay agreement for care worker those be just some of the immediate step that we have take the phase of the casey review will report next year and we continue to work closely with baroness casey to deliver the reform that be so desperately need after year of neglect include a number of year when the liberal democrats be in government 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 waiting list be at their low level for year we have take almost a quarter of a patient off waiting list and for the time in year waiting list be cut in april there be a long way to go but this government be finally put the nhs on the road to recovery through our plan for change i have announce that the nhs will also be at the forefront of the revolution in life science through the nhs app patient will be link up with relevant trial to boost our life science sector generate investment for the nhs and develop the medicine of the future 
 it be nearly year since professor sir chris whitty publish his striking report on health in coastal community covid inevitably delay implementation so will the secretary of state look again at that report deliver on the chief medical officer ’s recommendation and ensure that my constituent in bridlington and the wolds can access the health service that they need 
 the hon gentleman be right to commend sir chris whitty ’s report we have take that into consideration as well as the wide consultation we do in preparation for our year plan for health which will commit to tackle the gross health inequality that affect our country particularly in rural and coastal community 
 will   the   secretary of state join i in welcome the recent nhs waiting list figure that show that the worcestershire acute hospital nhs trust have see a fall of over since this government come into office do he agree that progress like this show that in partnership with our hard work nhs staff we can be the generation that take the nhs from the bad crisis in its history to the nhs that people deserve 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend it be thank to the fact that his constituent send he to this house of commons that we have a labour government able to deliver with he for his community 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i through the secretary of state pass on my good wish to the under secretary of state for health and social care   the hon member for west lancashire   ashley dalton in front of the health and social care committee in january nhs england ’s then chief financial officer set out that pretty much all the additional funding to the nhs last year would be absorb by pay rise national insurance contribution and inflation what proportion of the late additional funding will be absorb in the same way 
 i just do not buy the argument that invest in our staff be somehow not invest in the nhs who on earth do the opposition think provide the treatment deliver the care organise the clinic and deliver the service even in this great new world of technology the nhs will always be a people base service and i be proud that this be a government who deliver for staff we be also wag war on waste and that be how we can deliver fair pay for staff and improve care for patient if only the conservatives have do that when they have the chance 
 the right hon gentleman could not answer that question but hopefully we will get a more positive response to this i recently have the privilege of meet dr susan michaelis and her husband tristan who have set up the lobular moon shot project which large number of member of all party across the house have back they be seek £ over year a tiny sum in the context of the overall nhs budget to research lobular breast cancer which susan be currently battle to help improve outcome her immediate ask be even simple it be for the secretary of state to meet she in person to discuss the campaign and its aim he be a decent man will he agree to do that 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for his question and even more importantly i thank the amazing campaigner for what they be do this be probably the easy question he be ever go to ask i the answer be of course an emphatic yes 
 of the main concern i have about assist dying be that it should never be easy to help someone die than it be to help they live if pass the terminally ill adult end of life bill would make thousand of terminally ill people every year eligible to end their life on the nhs do our health service have the money to fund this service as well as its priority of bring down waiting list 
 can i thank my hon friend the minister for care for the considerable amount of work he have do to support the house as it make its deliberation on this important issue of course the government be neutral it be for the house to decide there be not money allocate to set up the service in the bill at present but it be for member of this house and the other place should the bill proceed to decide whether to proceed that be a decision that this government will respect either way 
 the   uk be desperately short of doctor but thousand of applicant will be turn away due to a lack of training place this be not a situation of the minister ’s making but he have now be in post for a year can he assure we   that nobody no union no treasury minister will prevent he from do what need to be do and lift the training cap 
 i should just say for the record that it be thank to my friend at the treasury that we be able to do so much to invest in our health service it be important to put that on record ahead of the budget the hon lady raise a really serious issue and we be look carefully at what we can do to ensure that we get great people into our health service and that they can look forward to a great career we be not in the right place as a country now we need to be in a well place the year plan will set out our ambition on workforce and we will publish a new workforce plan later this year 
 it be month since the publication of the hughes report but those patient harm by sodium valproate continue to await the outcome on the redress that the government will provide will the secretary of state please provide an update on when they can expect an announcement on the redress that will be make available to they 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question the government be carefully consider the work of the patient safety commissioner and her report which set out the option for redress this be a complex issue involve input from different government departments we will provide a further update on the commissioner ’s report soon 
 my constituency in scotland have a significant shortage of health and social care worker despite extensive effort to advertise recruitment to get people in as replicate in part of england wales and northern ireland the rug have be pull out from under that by the change to immigration policy and visa for that sector will the secretary of state commit to push this hard in cabinet to ensure that we can have more geographic and sectoral visa 
 i be really proud of the contribution that overseas worker make to health and social care service across our country if they all leave tomorrow the service would simply collapse but i think there be an overreliance on overseas staff in health and care service and that be contribute to level of net migration that be simply unsustainable i have a responsibility to help the home secretary bring those number down and to give opportunity through well pay and career progression to home grow talent and that be what we will do 
 i have receive many email regard poor service from pharmacy in my constituency in maryport resident report opening time not as advertise long queue low stock and delay receive vital medication will the minister tell the house how this government will ensure that the public get the good quality service from our local pharmacy 
 i be sorry to hear about the issue that my hon friend ’s constituent be experience i understand that he have raise the issue with the north east and north cumbria icb which be investigate his concern i would be happy to be keep inform and if he be not happy with the outcome of that investigation he should certainly come back to i this government be commit to support community pharmacy after a decade of underfunding and neglect we recently agree a record uplift to £ for 
 the secretary of state may well be aware of the great awareness among young people of nicotine pouch that seem to be a gap in the tobacco and vapes bill currently go through parliament will he commit to look at this issue to ensure that it be cover and that we bar this alongside other form of tobacco and nicotine 
 as the hon gentleman know through bitter experience that rotten industry always find a way and we have to keep on top of it and tackle the scourge of nicotine addiction he know about this issue well than most he have campaign so assiduously on it and he be right to raise it so let we look at what we can do to strengthen the bill if we can as it go through parliament 
 what step be the secretary of state take to enable access to non hormonal non steroidal oral contraceptive 
 such contraceptive be an emerge technology that will be subject to clinical and other relevant assessment before be consider for use in england the government remain committed to ensure that woman can access their preferred method in a timely manner a range of contraception be available free of charge from a range of setting that include a copper coil which be a non hormonal non steroidal contraceptive device 
 in prime minister ’s question last week i raise the need for a universal national screening programme for type diabetes will the secretary of state agree to meet i to discuss this so that it could form part of the year plan give that it fit so neatly into prevention of issue such as diabetic ketoacidosis over treatment 
 i be in the chamber to hear the hon member ’s question obviously we be lead by clinical advice when it come to decision on screening programme but i understand the case she make i would be delighted to ensure that she get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 earl mountbatten hospice in my constituency deliver outstanding care across the community despite that hampshire and isle of wight integrate care board plan to cut its funding by £ while other hospice in the region have their funding increase i be deeply concerned that the cut will affect our local health service will the minister meet i to discuss how we can restore that essential funding and protect hospice care for my constituent 
 we have provide hospice in england with a record £ in capital funding as my hon friend will know icb be responsible for commission palliative and end of life care service include hospice to meet the need of their local population nhs england have publish statutory guidance to support that i would of course be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far 
 the british dental association recently publish analysis show that the proportion of nhs funding spend on dentistry more than halve under the conservatives who fail to account for inflation and demand to the cost of £ it be no wonder that we have dental desert across much of the country will the secretary of state ensure that dentistry receive its fair share of funding from the new nhs funding allocate in the spending review 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to point to the neglect and incompetence of the past year we be fight to get nhs dentistry back to where it need to be an important step of course be the additional urgent appointment and supervise tooth brushing programme but long term contract reform be what be need alongside the investment that will come through the spending review 
 accord to the trussell trust the impact of hunger and hardship on people ’s health be drive an extra £ in government healthcare spending what part be the department play in reduce hunger and hardship and thus the related healthcare cost in my constituency and across the country 
 my hon friend be right to raise that important point it be truly shameful that child in the uk now live in poverty we be develop an ambitious strategy that tackle root cause and we be already take action alongside cross government work on free school meal breakfast club and fund childcare the department be invest £ in start for life service and support healthy diet for people through healthy start 
 opticians be important medical professional for our community unfortunately when i speak to the hertfordshire and west essex integrate care board i be tell that it will not allow optician to perform vital service such as treat minor eye injury as do so be deem too expensive despite that be the norm in the area surround my constituency will the minister meet i to discuss how we can ensure a fair system across the country rather than a postcode lottery 
 the hon gentleman be right to point to the anomaly in the eyecare system there be concern about the role that some aspect of the independent sector be play particularly in the light of the lucrative nature of cataract operation if he write to i i will be happy to set out the issue and i guarantee that he will get the response in due course 
 infertility be a medical condition that affect in couple in the uk but access to nhs treatment be a postcode lottery with less than of icb in england offer the recommend cycle of ivf do the minister agree that we need to end that postcode lottery and will she meet i and campaigner such as fertility action to discuss how we can end it for good 
 in the light of the broad pressure and change in the nhs we have be consider the ambition on fertility service and fairness for all couple the national institute for health and care excellence be review its fertility guideline which will be the clinical standard for the future i know that my hon friend will ensure that she and the group she talk about keep an eye on that and that she will work with they i be happy to keep work with she on how we good support icb to improve their local offer 
 i have raise with ministers before my concern about the closure of st mark ’s walk in urgent care centre in maidenhead frimley icb have confirm yet again that it will not reopen the centre against the will of the majority of maidenhead resident will the secretary of state meet i and local campaigner to see how we can finally get st mark ’s walk in centre back open after year of closure 
 i know that the hon gentleman ’s constituent will have note through his representation as a constituency mp that he could not have fight hard to save that service we devolve these sort of decision to icb in order that they make decision close to the community that they serve with the conviction that those sort of decision be well take locally than centralise in whitehall i understand the case that he make but have give icb a challenge resource and freedom we ministers must resist the temptation to meddle every time they make decision that they believe be right for the community even if those decision be controversial 
 will the minister look into minimise the pain of patient go through hysteroscopy and biopsy procedure by request that medical professional fully brief they on anaesthetic and pain relief in advance of procedure to ensure that they can plan accordingly 
 my hon friend raise an important question we be committed to improve woman ’s experience of gynaecological procedure include hysteroscopy woman should be provide with information prior to their procedure so that they can make an informed decision about the procedure and pain relief option include local or general anaesthetic he will probably make further representation which we will certainly look at 
 of the way in which the secretary of state have reduce the waiting list be by turbocharge the use of the private sector since january mean that half a people have be treat in irreducible spare capacity have that experience elicit any learning that the secretary of state be able to take into the wide reform agenda for the nhs 
 absolutely the nhs always do well under a labour government 
 bark community hospital in my constituency have be provide antenatal service to mother in barking for many year and woman also use its service to give birth i be therefore really disappointed when i hear last week that the maternity birthing unit be likely to close many in my community be deeply concerned they be be redirect to newham hospital which the care quality commission have rat as require improvement woman deserve to give birth in a safe clinical environment will ministers ensure that additional attention and resource be provide to newham hospital so that it improve its standard and my constituent who be be redirect to give birth there can do so in a safe clinical space 
 make sure that woman be give birth safely be the ultimate priority and the least that woman deserve i understand my hon friend ’s anxiety about this reconfiguration and she be right to raise that with the icb in the instance we be happy to meet she as ministers too the crucial thing be that the service be configure and deliver in a way that prioritise the safety of woman and their baby 
 in march the minister for care tell i that no decision could be take on a new dental school at the university of east anglia until the spending review settlement be know now that we know it will he instruct the office for student to allocate new training place at the uea from 
 the spending review have just be publish the key now be to secure the allocation within the overall financial envelope that will take a matter of week and i will be happy to report back to the hon member once we have that clarity 
 between and the health inequality weight in nhs allocation make a positive measurable difference to the health of deprived people unfortunately it be cut to in with the spending review ’s increase in funding to the nhs when will the health inequality weight reach 
 i be really grateful to my hon friend for her question she be right to highlight the importance of funding follow inequality to redress that imbalance i think she will be pleased with where we be with the year plan for health and i would be delighted to meet she to discuss it 
 people in east devon have be tell that they must now travel to exeter for audiology service that they previously receive at their local community hospital what step be the government take to encourage new provider to restore accessible audiology service 
 that have be a running theme this morning which will not be lose on ministers we will ensure as we deliver neighbourhood health service that people can receive care close to home wherever    they live we have hear that message loud and clear today and i think the hon member will see that priority reflect in our year plan for health 
 i declare an interest as my brother be a gp when my resident be able to get a gp appointment they be frustrate when they be send halfway across the borough to a different surgery from the they be register with by their primary care network can we address that and be it part of our proposal in the new gp contract 
 we do want to put gps at the heart of neighbourhood health service and we want people to have care close to home there be benefit to primary care work at scale so i would not want to criticise they for do that the important thing be different course for different horse some of we be much more mobile more active and more online and would welcome that flexibility for other continuity of care that be close to home or indeed in their home be important it be important that people get the right care in the right place at the right time wherever they live and that be what we will deliver 
 i be grateful for the consideration the secretary of state have already give to find a fair and more effective way of compensate those injure by a covid vaccination but he know that those who be profoundly affect by such injury be anxious for news can he give i and indeed they a progress report 
 i reassure the right hon and learn gentleman the constituent of his i have meet and other campaigner that i be have discussion with the cabinet office about how we deal with that and other issue that have be raise this morning include the sodium valproate scandal he know the complexity involve and i have be grateful for his advice as a former attorney general i do not have specific progress to report now but i reassure he and campaigner that this issue have not go off the boil and we be work to find a resolution 
 the challenge of find and keep an nhs dentist be raise with i time and again across the filton and bradley stoke constituency and i welcome the early action that this labour government have take to introduce more than urgent care appointment across our integrate care board area what will be the next step to help ensure that nhs dentistry be open up again to everybody 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and her relentless campaign on this issue she be right that the urgent dental appointment be a step and we be look to embed that so that it go forward every year of this parliament the broad issue be around contract reform there be no perfect contract system the current clearly be not work and we be look at option around sessional payment capitation and get a contract that work and bring dentist back into the nhs 
 the secretary of state will know that my local icb in bedfordshire luton and milton keynes be set to merge   with hertfordshire cambridgeshire and peterborough the new icb will cover a population of about people give the difficulty we have have secure a gp surgery in wixams will the secretary of state set out how supersizing that quango will help rural mid bed to get the local healthcare it need 
 may i respectfully say that that be part of the problem with conservative thinking they think that the answer to the nhs crisis be more quango and they measure success in the number of icb not the number of appointment and the size of the waiting list we be take a different approach slash bureaucracy and reinveste in the front line we be not centralise but decentralising and cut waiting list a record that the conservative party can not begin to touch 
 a couple of week ago at my constituency surgery though tear my constituent amy explain how follow a hip operation in she suffer progressive nerve damage due to repeat failure in diagnosis referral and treatment despite raise concern for year she be tell that her pain be common a nerve test in confirm damage and further test last year show a significant deterioration after year she have only now be offer surgery all amy want to know be what step be be take to ensure that no other patient be leave permanently disabled due to such prolonged and systemic failure 
 order that be very important but why do the hon member not want other to get in 
 on behalf of the nhs i apologise to my hon friend ’s constituent that be an intolerable situation but sadly not rare or exceptional there be too much of that happen and a culture of cover up and cover reputation rather than be honest with patient about failure we be change the culture safety be at the heart of the year plan and i would be delighted to talk to my hon friend far about his constituent ’s case 
 this morning i attend an event about bladder cancer bladder cancer be the high killer in the united kingdom and people be anxious to meet the minister and discuss those matter will he agree to meet bladder cancer organisation to take forward their objective to make thing well for people in the united kingdom 
 i be sure my hon friend the under secretary of state for health and social care ashley dalton who be the minister responsible for cancer would be delighted to meet campaigner particularly as we put together the national cancer plan we want to ensure that we capture every type of cancer and genuinely improve cancer care for everyone in our   country 
 the minister may have see my constituent mollie mulheron recently feature on newsnight our local icb recently refuse her access to fertility treatment after recovery from an aggressive cancer with a high likelihood that her illness   will return will the minister meet i and mollie to discuss that issue and access to fertility treatment for cancer survivor and patient 
 yes i will make sure that my hon friend get that meeting 
 on a point of order mr speaker during proceeding of the house on   june it become clear that some medium organisation have be give access to the strategic defence review document before parliament we also become aware that the timing of such early access may have be different for different organisation i ask a parliamentary question on the matter of who and when and although the government do not answer the question they make clear that trade association and think tank have also be give early access i ask again and they refuse to answer but make clear that trade union and our people have be give early access 
 mr speaker ministers be require to answer question use the nolan principle which include accountability and openness the principle state 
 information should not be withhold from the public unless there be clear and lawful reason for so do 
 the government have not follow these process in answer the question and that be particularly relevant to the minister for the armed forces because in his declaration in the register of members financial interests he declare membership of the gmb and unite and that a family member be work as a constituent for babcock international and that 
 order the hon lady have raise a point of order with i but she can not go into a full speech i have get the message and i be very clear on the message i have no responsibility for the quality of answer to write parliamentary question but i know this be key that the procedure committee take a close interest in the matter she might therefore like to raise it with   the hon member for lancaster and wyre cat smith who chair the committee 
 far to that point of order mr speaker 
 let i finish with this please raise the matter with the procedure committee would be a good way to take this forward 
 far to that point of order mr speaker we now know undoubtedly that the sunday times be give access to the white paper because people could read most of it in the sunday times the day before parliament see it although crucially the article do not mention up to new ssn nuclear power attack submarine i will explain in a quick why that be important mr speaker 
 at on the monday morning journalist be invite to a reading room in horse guards parade where they be give access to the white paper section of the ministerial code clearly state 
 where commercially sensitive material be involve no copy should be make available to the medium before publication 
 thus that be clearly a breach of the code 
 however there be an early sitting in the reading room at am when we know the white paper be also see by member of defence company trade association academic think tank and trade unionist at the same   time that the market be open mr speaker there be a possibility of insider trading the share price of babcock which would benefit from maintain ssn leapt very early on after am 
 order 
 but mr speaker 
 no no no please do not take advantage of the chair point of order be mean to be a little bit more punchy they be not full blow statement i take very seriously the point that have be make and that be why i raise they myself at the time i be very grateful to the right hon member for reiterate my word 
 i have no responsibility for the ministerial code if the house so wish that need to change because unfortunately it make a nonsense there be a ministerial code but it be not be keep to as we would expect it be for this house to change the ministerial code if it wish to do so or i would be more than happy for the government to change it if they can not accept it because we can not have this continual breaking of the ministerial code it be appalling and it be unacceptable 
 this be not a political point in the end i be here to uphold the right of back benchers back benchers should hear thing if document be to be give out they should be give to mps i be here to support mp but unfortunately in this particular area i do not have the power to do so i wish i have because thing would be different 
 on a point of order mr speaker i seek your advice over the past few day we have recognise jo cox ’s murder give the additional focus and the encouragement of the targeting of mp use false information can you advise we as the person responsible for the safety of member of parliament how we as member should be behave both in the chamber and online 
 we will never discuss member security on the floor of the house if there be issue member should please come to see i privately let i see what i can do to reassure member but i certainly do not want to open a debate because i do not think that that would add to member safety please come and see i privately 
 presentation and reading standing order no 
 peter dowd support by patrick hurley kim johnson david baines ian byrne derek twigg and paula barker present a bill to increase the minimum require height of guard in multi storey car park to make provision about the height of guard in exist multi storey car park to require hour staffing of multi storey car park and for connected purpose 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday july and to be print bill 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision for the inclusion of a parent ’s detail on a child ’s birth certificate where that parent have die before the birth of the child and for connected purpose 
 for the vast majority of parent register the birth of their child be a straightforward process it be a simple piece of paperwork that mark a special moment and bring important recognition of their new family along with notable legal right yet for a number of woman every year what should be an uncontroversial step in their journey as a parent become a protracted and traumatic legal battle 
 the law dictate that it be the duty of the parent to register the birth of a child within day for married couple there be a presumption of paternity for the husband under the law that mean either parent may register the birth unaccompanie by the other with both still record on the birth certificate therefore in the terrible event that their husband die before the child be bear a widow mother can still ensure their name be on the birth certificate which be common sense 
 however if the couple be unmarried the law do not recognise their relationship in the same way the fact that the mother do not have a ring on her finger mean there be no automatic recognition of paternity if an unmarried woman experience the unimaginable tragedy of lose her partner during pregnancy there be no provision for she to register they on the child ’s birth certificate unless both parent can be present the registrar be deem unable to verify the paternity of the father while suffer the grief of lose a love and face the new reality of parenthood alone bereaved mother leave the register office with a blank space on their child ’s birth certificate instead of their partner ’s name 
 in order to amend the birth certificate bereaved mother have to seek a declaration of parentage through a lengthy costly and traumatise legal process in the family court in some respect this be a legal loophole the effect of improper and outdated legislation that have fail to provide for a certain set of particularly tragic circumstance but it speak to a deep inequality in the legal system unmarried couple be hold in low regard the law in this area have not keep pace with societal change 
 the charity widowed and young bring this injustice to my attention it be an organisation that provide fantastic support to those who have experience widowhood early in life i pay tribute to   the hon member for south devon caroline voaden   who secure an adjournment debate on this issue and speak powerfully and movingly of her own experience of bereavement and to my hon friend   the member for walthamstow ms creasy who expose the shortcoming of the legal process in parliament in 
 the bill seek to legislate for widowed and young ’s blank space campaign to come into existence to provide a clear and simple process for unmarried and    bereaved mother to register their partner on their child ’s birth certificate through the charity i have hear the story of brave and inspiring woman some of whom be in the gallery today to watch the proceeding i would like to share their experience which illustrate the emotional impact of this issue 
 when kelly ’s partner jordan die suddenly in she go from plan their future to plan her fiancé ’s funeral shortly after she give birth to their daughter kelly ’s battle begin to prove that jordan be the father as kelly say he have want 
 nothing more out of his life than to have kid

 sophie enter the uphill battle of amend the birth certificate and be bounce between departments and adviser until someone at the children and family court advisory and support service intervene on her behalf her hearing be at the magistrate court on   july   and will hopefully bring she some closure on this issue sophie say the experience have be 
 exhausting confusing and emotionally drain 
 i add my personal thank to the woman who join we today for share their brave story and for allow i to share they with the house 
 kelly orlanda and sophie ’s story show how traumatic and unnecessarily complex the process be widow and young estimate that this issue affect as many as woman each year while the woman who join we   today have persevere through the family court many mother will give up out of frustration leave that blank space on their child ’s birth certificate 
 the system for register birth be govern by section of the births and deaths registration act and section 55a of the family law act which make provision for those require a declaration of parentage neither of those act provide for the specific circumstance in which parent be deceased and a child be bear outside of marriage a declaration of parentage be not intend to prove the paternity of a deceased partner but rather to resolve dispute parenthood this legal framework be unfit for purpose when the births and deaths registration act become law in of birth register in the uk be within a marriage that figure have reduce steadily ever since and only half of child be now bear within marriage time have change and society have move on yet the law have not keep pace 
 this bill would drag the legislation into the century and provide a clear and simple process for register a deceased partner ’s name on a birth certificate we can achieve that by place great reliance on a registrar ’s professional judgement with the right evidence registrar be allow to amend a birth certificate so we can similarly empower they to correct the absence of a deceased parent provide that they receive sufficient evidence of intended parenthood 
 across europe in switzerland france and germany unmarried parent be encourage to register their parentage at antenatal appointment a similar system could be create here and a declaration of intended parentage could be make during pregnancy i do not contest the importance of have a rigorous process for prove intend parenthood but that importance be an argument in support of a change in the law not against it because that process be currently non existent official be often unable to advise woman on how to register their deceased partner as a parent because there be no guidance while there remain no clear route to prove intended parenthood bereave unmarried mother be be deny a basic right 
 the anachronistic legal framework be cause immense trauma for mother and child this bill would take direct action to address that injustice provide a clear process for bereaved mother to follow and allow the registrar to include a deceased partner on their child ’s birth certificate that small change in the law would make a huge difference it would spare grieve    woman a needlessly painful legal process and ensure that no mother or child have a blank space on their birth certificate where their parent ’s name should rightly be
