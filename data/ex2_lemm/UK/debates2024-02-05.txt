i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s support for this action he ask a series of question which i will rattle through be the action effective yes they hit the target be all the target hit again yes we be still carry out surveillance to find out the exact impact but i think we can be very confident that all the relevant objective be reach we combine very closely with our us colleague and sometimes interchange some of those target with they the right hon gentleman will have note that on this occasion we be involve in drop munition on more target than previously so we carry a slightly great weight than before 
 the right hon gentleman ask whether the action be successful and rightly point out that what we be see be rather more sporadic the attack include on hms diamond and on merchant shipping have continue but in a much more ad hoc fashion it be perhaps relevant that there have be no attack use multiple different weapon at the same time which we see for example on   january the degrading will have have some impact on that i will come back to the right hon gentleman ’s comment about the prime minister at the end i want to set the record straight 
 the right hon gentleman ask about operation prosperity guardian the simple answer of course be that none of we know how long it will need to continue for but we want it to come to a conclusion as quickly as possible 
 we utterly reject any notion that these continue attack by the houthis be anything to do with the situation in gaza the houthis be opportunist pirate who be use a situation to their benefit a few year   ago they do not even support hamas but suddenly they want to be their great champion they be over kilometre away from gaza they be simply use the situation to their advantage and it be wise for the house to not over link the none the less the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to about the need to see a humanitarian truce and a sustainable ceasefire that be the government ’s policy we be work extremely hard to try to achieve that include through discussion that the prime minister the foreign secretary and myself be have just yesterday i be have those discussion in the middle east 
 the right hon gentleman ask about raf flight the issue be not get the aid to location i have be work very closely with the cypriot government for example on how we can increase the amount of aid the single big problem remain get the aid into the country we have some success with get kerem shalom open but what we really need to see be ashdod open in order to route that aid to kerem shalom and straight into gaza the government and i will continue to push for that route but the problem be not the flight take off it be the aid get in 
 finally turn to the fact that it be myself as defence secretary stand at the dispatch box rather than the prime minister the thing to say be that it be the secretary of state for defence who actually have legal responsibility for these action who sign off the target and indeed the legal authority technically it be i who should be stand here other than for the couple of round where the prime minister be deal with something new and it be therefore very appropriate for he to be at the dispatch box 
 the wide point that i would gently make to the right hon gentleman though be that the prime minister be in northern ireland today do incredibly important work—[interruption i hear from a sedentary position the suggestion that we should have be recall yesterday but i unsure whether that would have be entirely practical it be entirely appropriate that the prime minister be in northern ireland i would have think that the house would welcome the fact that that historic breakthrough have be mark by the prime minister and it be very appropriate that i be here today to explain the activity of saturday night to the house 
 although it be clear that the houthi attack have not end as the shadow defence secretary say there do appear to have be a difference in the cadence the mass attack that we see on   january for example have not be repeat partly because the houthis ability have be degrade however we be always look at other mean include route via the united nations and at the wide picture of for instance the peace treaty between saudi arabia and yemen all those element fit into the way in which we be apply pressure to try to bring the situation to a close 
 not so much she say so there we go i reiterate that the disability action plan be not just another consultation but real tangible action to change people ’s daily life with practical action across different area it be about build a society that work for everyone 
 the hon member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft   be right to point out that day to day life be too difficult for disabled people and their family i agree with she that be why we have take the opportunity we can take in this round alongside the wide national disability strategy i would love to boil the ocean and to have fix everything in the month or so i have be in the role but i assure hon member that irrespective of the perceive level of the role i have the convene power and support across government i be delighted that the hon lady keep push for my elevation but under the previous labour administration the minister for disabled people be an under secretary of state i be extremely proud to be an under secretary of state 
 i thank my right hon friend for her point about the special olympics when i be sports minister i have the honour of meet her constituent i share his passion for a very important movement it be potentially life change which be why i be delighted that it be in this plan 
 my right hon friend ask about the evidence and datum around the disability action plan the plan be there to improve the quality of government health datum and to increase insight into the need and barrier that affect disabled people ’s daily life ultimately we will evaluate the impact of these policy and service and we will use datum when they be available to monitor and assess the outcome of the plan we will start work on develop more comprehensive evaluation i know that through her role as the chair of the select committee she will absolutely measure i and my role in this i assure she the house and all those watch that the plan be absolutely about learn and deliver on this challenge 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take to help people save for the future 
 what step his department be take to help people save for the future 
 what step his department be take to help people save for the future 
 automatic enrolment have succeed in transform pension saving with more than employee be automatically enrol in a workplace pension since and an additional £ in real term save into marketplace pension in compare with 
 i be very pleased when the government bring in auto enrolment for pension in as make sure that everyone save for a pension should prevent pension poverty what be the rate of take up of these pension and what provision be the government put in place to help those on low wage build up a pension pot to help provide a decent income in retirement 
 the increase in take up since have be extraordinary particularly among woman for whom the rate be in and be now and in line with man my hon friend will know about the review that we conduct on auto enrolment as and when we bring in those change that will mean more people auto enrol with £ of additional saving each year 
 i be chair of the insurance and financial service all party parliamentary group and financial inclusion have be of our key area of focus particularly follow the pandemic which show that anybody have the potential to quickly become vulnerable what be the government do to increase the financial resilience of our constituent and make they well place to cope should such an unforeseen event happen again 
 may i recognise the fantastic work my hon friend do on financial resilience the government have through very difficult time come forward with £ of cost of living payment between and i would point my hon friend to particular scheme the help to save scheme encourage low income household to save and we have recently extend that by month until april 
 i call james sunderland not here i call the chair of the select committee 
 i agree with the secretary of state about the cross party success of auto enrolment which have double the proportion of eligible employee save for retirement but we know   that the current regular auto enrolment contribution of of earning be not enough to deliver the standard of live in retirement that most people hope for do the secretary of state recognise that that minimum level of contribution will need to be increase 
 the contribution rate of the employer and employee be a very important matter and we keep both under review 
 i call jim shannon always here 
 thank you mr speaker 
 when i be my mother take i to danske bank or northern bank as it be then and open an account for i when i be my mother phone up the pension man in ballywalter and tell he i need a pension my mother have be a big guide in my life what would the secretary of state say to encourage the young people of today to take their mother ’s advice on open bank and pension account and plan for the future 
 i think the response to that be always take your mother ’s advice i always do and look where it get i at the age of i would have think the hon gentleman would have be save into a piggy bank put his little penny in a porcelain pig i direct he to the gov.uk website where there be a plethora of information for young people and those of all age about save and what the government be do to assist 
 the good news be that mrs shannon be still give he advice i call the shadow minister 
 of the simple way to get people save for the future be by ensure that they be enrol in a pension scheme but all too many be currently exclude from auto enrolment particularly woman who be twice as likely to miss out the government have know about this problem for year they propose widen the criterion in last year thank to a private member ’s bill the minister be give the power to do just that but still we have see no update on when this will be implement can the secretary of state shed light on when these vital change will take place 
 the hon lady draw attention to saving for woman i have already state that of woman invest in workplace pension back in and that have skyrocket to today there be now employer provide pension through the auto enrolment route and there be £ more in workplace pension in than be the case in the hon lady refer i think to the review which i have already refer to that be currently under review 
 what step his department be take to help people with long term sickness into work 
 this government have a range of initiative to support disabled people and people with long term sickness to start stay and succeed in work at the autumn statement we build on that by expand universal support launch workwell pilot and establish work on the reform of the fit note 
 my hon friend will know about the excellent work be do by people such as my maltby constituent ian birch and all his colleague at reed in partnership across the whole of rotherham they use dwp funding to help those with long term issue of sickness and illness to get back into work and on their foot what be her department do to make sure that those who go through these programme stay in work permanently and contribute to the local economy 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight the value of our local dwp programme in rother valley the reed in partnership approach have give vital support to his constituent help they into work it be vital to keep support they to remain there and that be where that particular programme help access to work and our disability confident scheme be just some of the initiative to support disabled people and those with health condition while in employment 
 half the woman survey with endometriosis have to take time off work often or very often because of their condition and in woman have to give up work altogether will the minister meet the incredible woman from endometriosis support hull and east yorkshire to discuss the work they be do with the local trade union to create a good practice charter for employer in hull to support woman with endometriosis in the workplace 
 i be in aberdeen on thursday meet woman with health condition and hear about how we can well support woman who be have debilitate impact from the menopause that be in the oil and gas sector where it take a long time to build up to a senior career i would be interested to hear about the work that the hon lady ’s local team be do through the wide woman ’s health strategy we be support woman to have a thriving career all the way through i be keen to hear from she and those woman and to support the woman to stay in work 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the child maintenance service in collect child maintenance payment 
 the government be dedicate to ensure that parent meet their obligation to child and we take robust enforcement action against those who do not parent who pay some maintenance on the collect and pay service increase from to over the month from september 
 my constituent ’s daughter be a young lady who have miss out for more than a year on child maintenance payment because her father change job and the child maintenance service lose track of he my team have be involve and despite lot of faffe she still have not receive a payment she be of around half of child in separate family who be not receive the maintenance payment they deserve will the minister explain what his department be do to ensure that the employer of these miss parent be properly chase up 
 where parent have certain category of taxable income not be capture by the standard child maintenance calculation they can make a request to the cms to have the calculation vary we have consult on proposal to include more type of taxable income hold by his majesty ’s revenue and customs in the standard maintenance calculation 
 the department have a number of way to try to get pay parent to cough up and we must remember that this be cash for the child in july the government consult on child maintenance and improve our enforcement power through the commencement of curfew order and we still have not have a response to that consultation i would be grateful to hear from the government when they plan to respond and i remind they of the other power in place such as deprive people of the ability to drive or of their passport this be a simple thing where people have the money and will not cough up the cash i think we need to get on with curfew order 
 my right hon friend be quite right that the government have consult on the use of curfew which be complex and interact with numerous government service several enforcement initiative aim at improve compliance be currently in train and we need to get those in place and assess their effect before we can well see how curfew might fit with they i note her enthusiasm for curfew and might well put she in touch with viscount younger of leckie the minister in the lords whose policy brief this be so that he can update she on our late thinking 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of level of benefit 
 welfare be there to help those who need assistance include many of the most vulnerable which be why we increase most benefit by for that be on top of an increase of include the benefit cap in 
 that be all very well but the rate of inflation for low pay family have be significantly high than the headline rate of inflation for some time that mean that those family who be struggle badly last year be struggle even bad this year citizens advice have show that family on low income have less disposable income this year than they have last   year do the secretary of state accept that it be time to introduce an essential guarantee so that nobody on universal credit or another income base benefit can ever be allow to fall below a level where they can not afford the basic essential of life 
 as the hon gentleman will know we keep all benefit under review i point he to various thing that we have do to ensure that we look after those low income family include increase the national living wage by about in both of the last year the increase in the local housing allowance to the percentile announce at the last fiscal event which will be worth about £ a year for about people and of course the tax cut that the chancellor be able to bring forward which for an average earner be worth £ a year 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 rather than deal with the know policy failure within the benefit system the government seem to be more focused on penalise people through for example the child cap last week the labour party join the conservatives in prioritise lift the cap on banker bonus rather than the child cap on work woman do the secretary of state take comfort in the fact that his cruel legacy will be protect by the labour party 
 i be not go to get involve in the crossfire between the scottish national party and the labour party other than to say—[interruption 
 order i do not need a continue argument and disagreement i be sure that when the question come to an end you can speak outside 
 thank you mr speaker the child cap be there for good reason so that family in those circumstance be take the same kind of decision that other the taxpayer funding benefit have to take 
 what step he be take to help reduce child poverty 
 what recent estimate he have make of the number of child in poverty 
 in the late statistic there be few child in absolute poverty after housing cost than there be in in this financial year we will spend about £ on welfare support working age family we be also provide £ between and to help family with cost of living pressure however the government ’s focus be firmly on reduce the risk of child poverty by support parent into work in every way we can 
 the joseph rowntree foundation recently find that of child in bolton live below the poverty line after year of tory cut and general   incompetence britain now have the bad rise in child poverty among the major country what would the minister say to a young family in bolton who tell i day we eat and day we do n’t 
 nobody on either side of the house want to see family struggle however i repeat that child live in workless household be about time more likely to be in absolute poverty after housing cost than those in household where all adult work the government be support the whole family through our childcare support which we have increase by almost to £ a month for child or £ for the increase in the national living wage to £ from april our cost of living offer and so on 
 the recent joseph rowntree foundation report highlight scotland ’s much low child poverty rate compare with england and wales and say that that be partly due to the scottish government ’s child payment further progress be constrain by the uk ’s inadequate social security system the trussell trust ’s guarantee our essential campaign show that of low income household on universal credit in the uk can not afford everyday essential do the minister accept that raise the universal credit basic rate be critical to tackle child poverty 
 the welfare system be there to be a strong safety net it be not about a singular issue because no household be the same it be about wraparound care and deal with people on an individual basis it be about make sure that where child need support for example with free school meal we provide it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 far to the minister ’s response the prime minister have be ask similar question about child poverty in recent prime minister ’s question he usually respond that since the conservatives have lift people out of absolute poverty which as you know mr speaker track living standard from a fix point in time can the minister tell i how many more people on average labour lift out of absolute poverty annually compare with the since that the prime minister regularly claim 
 rather than trade number i would say that this be about give people the dignity of a job since few people be in absolute poverty after housing cost include few child and few working age adult i know the hon lady say that work be not the labour party ’s priority but it be very much our priority 
 if the minister can point to an occasion when i have say that work be not the labour party ’s priority she ought to say when that be or she should withdraw that remark 
 the answer to my question be that on average more than more people leave poverty in each year of the labour government the prime minister ’s claim be pathetic which of the following do the minister think have the big impact on those poverty number be it when the conservatives repeal the child poverty   act be it when they shut down the child poverty unit be it the collapse in the value of child benefit or be it the financial chaos cause by a conservative prime minister in september which put all family finance at risk 
 no it be the fact that over more people be in work and youth employment be up by around ensure that people have the dignity of work and that when they be not in work there be a strong welfare system around they be what this country need 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the potential relationship between increase in the cost of living and trend in the use of food bank 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the potential relationship between increase in the cost of living and trend in the use of food bank 
 the government take food security very seriously and be commit to understanding and address food poverty the reason that people use food bank be complex and varied food bank be independent charitable organisation and the government have no role in their operation as such datum on trend be not currently available 
 the staff and volunteer at the norwood and brixton food bank in my constituency work tirelessly all year round to support local people who simply can not make end meet they be respond to the high level of need they have ever see why do the minister think that despite this be of the rich country in the world food bank reliance be continue to rise so much on this government ’s watch can she tell the house what the government be do to end the need for food bank in the uk 
 as i say the reason that people use food bank be complex and varied as all the research indicate we offer support through cost of living payment and the household support fund run to hundred of million of pound the rise in the national living wage the reduction in national insurance and the local housing allowance far help low income household we have a whole of suite of way to help the very poor in our society 
 food bank such as the excellent luton foodbank have be push to breaking point this winter as more and more people need emergency food due to the conservatives cost of living crisis it be shameful that we now have more food bank than police station what conversation have the minister have with colleague in the treasury about introduce measure in next month ’s budget to support low income work people face hardship and to reduce the dependence on food bank 
 i point the hon lady to the further cost of living payment that will be go out this week to eligible household we do not comment on future fiscal announcement 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the carer ’s allowance for people who care for more than person 
 this be a particular area of interest for i as a former carer and as part of a caring family it be important that we get the right balance the flat weekly rate for the carer ’s allowance have never be link to the number of people be care for the weekly rate will increase to £ from april which be almost an extra £ a year since 
 the hundred of thousand of carer up and down the country be the unsung hero of our society who do a fantastic job whether it be care for elderly parent with dementia or sacrifice full time work to care for a disabled child carer play a critical role ease the burden on health service for most carer care be a job and they can not take full time work because of it when will the government realise that £ and now even £ be measly and do not scratch the surface of what carer have to put up with and pay for particularly when many carer be care for more than person 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point which i appreciate as i have be in that situation of care for people the primary purpose of the carer ’s allowance be to provide a measure of financial support and recognition for people unable to work full time because of their caring responsibility i know there be very strong view on this i be look forward to meet with carers uk just after recess i be afraid i can not do so before due to a funeral and hear the vary view and how we can continue to support our carer who in every constituency and community do an amazing job 
 whether his department be take step to reduce the time take for personal independence payment mandatory reconsideration decision to be make 
 we have reduce clearance time from the peak of day in to day in october by improve process and increase decision make capacity we will continue to improve efficiency while ensure effective decision making for all reconsideration 
 in july last year a constituent be not able to correctly fill out their pip review form which lead to their payment be stop it take until last thursday month from the mandatory reconsideration go in for the payment to finally be restore because of the delay my constituent fall   into debt and become suicidal why be the government not eliminate the delay that be let down the most vulnerable constituent 
 i be very sorry to hear about the hon lady ’s constituent our aim be always to make the right decision as early as possible in the claim journey and i would be keen to see the full detail of that particular situation on decision it be important to consider the context initial decision follow an assessment have be make between june and july have result in a complete tribunal hearing with overturn i would be very keen to see what have happen in the case that the hon lady mention 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as my hon friend   the member for newport east jessica morden   have just highlight the department be in chaos and that be have a huge impact on claimant life as of october there be new personal independence payment claim wait to be process with a further claimant await an award review as of november people be await access to work decision we be talk about hundred of thousand of disabled people leave in financial limbo with ten of thousand wait to start work what message do the minister think these huge backlog send to disabled people and how do she finally plan to get a grip of they 
 i thank the hon lady for make the important point about the number i agree that behind each of those be somebody we should be concern about and i be absolutely look at this point we be continue to learn from decision overturn by appeal and we will continue to make improvement to our decision make process to help people to get the correct decision early in their claim journey and to be able to work and have the support where it be need not everybody on pip be out of work so we need to be listen to the need of the people in those queue i be conscious that every of they be not a statistic but a person who need our support 
 what estimate his department have make of the cost to the public purse of economic inactivity due to ill health 
 what step his department be take to reduce labour inactivity 
 what step his department be take to reduce labour inactivity 
 there be of course significant cost relate to an increase in long term sickness and illness rate in work that be why we have our £ back to work plan to help disabled people and people with health condition start and stay in work   that approach along with other have see economic inactivity reduce by since its peak during the pandemic 
 nhs waiting list be currently at with more than people on waiting list in my own nhs trust area when it be this difficult to access medical treatment it be no surprise that we have a record people out of work due to ill health do the minister accept that this government ’s failure on the nhs be stymie economic growth deny people the dignity of work and cost taxpayer billion of pound 
 on nhs waiting list there have be progress in that the year waiting list have almost be entirely dispense with and those of month have be very substantially reduce our department recognise that work be part of the solution to improve people ’s health which be why we be put forward the workwell service bring together medical input and work coach input fit note reform to help at an early stage of the journey and the reform to the work coach assessment all those thing be move towards get more people into work which be good for their health 
 in barrow and furness an estimate people who could be contribute to the labour market be not do so i be incredibly grateful to my right hon friend and his team in the barrow jobcentre and centrally who alongside team barrow have work with local employer and skill provider to help get those people back into our incredibly tight labour market will he pass my thank on to those team may i also encourage he to visit to see their good work 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight all the good work that have go on in his constituency i believe he open a jobcentre only as recently as   january   in his constituency he be a doughty campaigner for and supporter of employment in his patch he ask whether i will visit his constituency i would certainly like to consider that but my hon friend the employment minister might also visit because she just say she be particularly keen to do so 
 there we be 
 burnley and padiham have so much go for it with the rest of lancashire our area be the manufacture powerhouse of the united kingdom but still have stubborn level of economic inactivity among people who could be contribute to economic growth and have financial security which we all want they to have what more can we do to help those people in particular can my right hon friend do more to join up with other departments so that area such as burnley which might have structural problem get more intensive support 
 my hon friend ask what approach we can take to resolve the issue that he have raise we have announce a doubling of universal support a scheme with which he will be familiar workwell to which i just refer bring together medical support and work coach and reform of the fit note system so that we get involve early in the journey that many people   experience when they fall out of the workforce into long term sickness and disability benefit overall the evidence be clear economic inactivity be down by on the year and by more than a of a since its peak during the pandemic a reduction 
 what estimate he have make of the number of job provide by business in witham constituency 
 the office for national statistics estimate that job be provide by employer in witham in 
 as it be apprenticeship week will the secretary of state join i in thank business in witham for everything that they be do to employ youngster and put they on that apprenticeship pathway those business however be cry out for a labour market strategy that will help they to harness the skill and the upskilling that they need in certain sector would the secretary of state be prepared to advance that and push it across other departments 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on the extraordinary work that she do locally to promote apprenticeship i believe she be involve in a job fair on   january host by reed which be highly successful the employment rate in her constituency be well above the national average which i put down almost entirely to the work that she be do she ask how we would proceed we already have swap bootcamp and returnership but i be indeed look at specific area of the labour market particularly in the context of migration change where we may be able to do more on a strategic basis 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential cost of restore parity in the level of state pension receive by uk citizen live overseas 
 accord to the late estimate base on datum from march uprate the state pension where we do not currently do so would cost about £ a year if all uk state pension in payment be increase to current uk level 
 follow our withdrawal from the eu we be rightly able to move close to our partner in the commonwealth way in which we could do that would be to confirm that all british citizen who live in the commonwealth should be entitle to the appropriate uprating of their state pension as if they be still in the uk that would seem to be a matter of simple fairness will the minister meet i to discuss the practicality of make it happen and restore some much need common sense to a needlessly complicate situation 
 the uk government continue to uprate state pension when there be a legal requirement for that to be do and have no plan to change their long stand policy or enter into new reciprocal social security agreement 
 if he will take step to simplify the benefit claim process for cancer patient 
 understandably such a health diagnosis can be a shock for individual their family and indeed their finance and i be conscious of say this just after world cancer day it be important to ensure that people have the right support as soon as possible and as part of our reform we will simplify the system to reduce the assessment burden and improve people ’s experience of assessment 
 i thank the minister for her response but those change can not come too soon for my constituent emily who be diagnose with breast cancer in november be too ill to work and be find the benefit system impossible to navigate dwp official have push she from pillar to post unable to decide whether she be eligible for employment and support allowance and universal credit she have be force to fill in countless form and be even require to attend a jobcentre appointment over christmas despite be seriously unwell do the minister agree this be simply not good enough and that we need to put those change in place so that people like emily do not have to go through this 
 i be sorry to hear about emily ’s situation i would remind other in her situation that there be a help to claim service available through citizens advice and also a benefit calculator on gov.uk but i would also be extremely keen to see the detail of what have happen i would be happy to meet the hon lady or to look at the detail whatever she would prefer 
 what step he plan to take to increase level of employment in cumbria 
 what step his department be take to expand the support available through jobcentre in cheadle constituency 
 what step he be take to help fill job vacancy in darlington constituency 
 across the country our fantastic work coach be support people to secure and progress in work in kendal cheadle and darlington jobcentre be work with local and national employer to match jobseeker with vacancy through job fair sector base work academy programme and apprenticeship as it be national   apprenticeship week this be a great time for employer to promote the opportunity available and i urge all colleague who have not yet do so to visit their jobcentre if it have an apprenticeship fair on the hon gentleman ’s be last week be n’t it 
 i do indeed celebrate the work of the kendal jobcentre it do a fantastic job but problem be that it have too small a workforce this week we mourn the loss of yet another lake district business this time a bistro in coniston due in part to the loss of affordable home and to restrictive visa rule both of which be shrink our local workforce will the minister meet i and local cumbrian business leader to develop a plan to tackle cumbria ’s workforce crisis 
 i be happy to meet the hon gentleman but i also gently say that this be about other government departments as well i will certainly work with he as far as employer go under my remit 
 speak to stockport jobcentre last week i hear about the success of the movement to work scheme which place young people with employer include in the civil service however the lengthy civil service application process be delay placement will my hon friend look into how the process could be streamline and accelerate and join i on a visit to stockport jobcentre 
 i know that senior civil servant be engage in pilot an initiative that will help to speed this up because we need to place those candidate more quickly and ensure that we get they into work swiftly i would love to visit stockport and add its jobcentre to the grow list that i have visit 
 i put on record my thank to my hon friend   the member for hexham guy opperman   for his work to establish the jobcentre plus facebook page of which darlington ’s be the will my hon friend the minister outline how successful that page have be and what further plan she have to develop accessible social medium job advertising 
 we know that social medium help and that to year old in particular enjoy engage with a digital platform when they be look for work we have have instance in the past of people thank we when they have be give interview online it be important that post be accessible and we be work to ensure that this be the case i would point customer of any age to the jobhelp website which have a host of useful information i be keen to see if we can roll out such progress far 
 i do find that a strange grouping but not to worry minister well deal with how you get from cumbria across the country like that be amazing 
 what step he be take to help ensure workplace be accessible for autistic people 
 autistic people have a huge amount to offer in the workforce which be why we set up the buckland review in april lead by my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland to look at the barrier to autistic people gain employment and to ensure that we have a more inclusive workforce for they 
 may i push the minister on what progress have be make by the buckland review will he also remind jobcentre up and down the country that people on the autism spectrum have great talent and often need only slight workplace modification of simple thing such as lighting or noise level this could open up a source of real talent for our country 
 the hon gentleman be entirely right small change can often make a big difference not just for autistic people but for the business they go on to serve and work in he will have to be a little more patient about the buckland review report come out but it will not be long i also point he to the access to work and disability confident approach which both do exactly what he suggest 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the number of people who be not eligible for statutory sick pay because they be pay less than the low earning limit on level of inequality in stoke on trent north constituency 
 the department have not make a specific assessment for the stoke on trent north constituency but i refer my hon friend to the evidence i present to the work and pensions committee last week i look forward to meet he this week to discuss this in more detail 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her answer i be proud to have join a campaign together with my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   and   the hon member for glasgow east david linden to reform statutory sick pay that campaign lead by the centre for progressive change be reference in today ’s times health commission report ahead of the spring budget will the department join we in lobby the treasury to make these important change so that we have a healthy workforce that contribute more to our economy and more importantly so that we make sure that work pay fairly 
 i refer my hon friend to the answer i give to the work and pensions committee statutory sick pay be considerably more complex than he make out but it be nice to see all this cross party collaboration

 lambeth council and southwark council have work hard over the past few year to deliver targeted cost of live support through the household support fund many local people continue to face serious hardship as a consequence of this government ’s political decision but local authority do not know what if any funding they will receive after   march when do the secretary of state expect to confirm the future of the household support fund so that local authority can plan ahead 
 i be pleased that the hon lady recognise the importance and value of our various intervention payment have be make through the hsf since its inception and £ have be put into the fund in the last year she will know that her question be a matter for the chancellor and the matter will quite possibly i really do not know be deal with at a future fiscal event there be no news on that at this stage

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this morning the office for national statistics publish the long await update figure from the labour market survey can the secretary of state now confirm that our employment   rate be even low than previously think and that there be at least more people out of work due to long term sickness we think that the cost of health relate inactivity be an additional £ a year since the pandemic but give these new figure can he tell the house how much more his government ’s failure be cost taxpayer every single year 
 order i remind front benchers that this be topical question which be mean to be short and punchy and they should stick to the rule do we understand each other 
 the hon lady refer to the late weighted number just release by the office for national statistics which show that unemployment as a percentage be low than originally forecast she can not get away from the fact that there be few people in economic inactivity since the peak as a result of our work capability assessment reform the office for budget responsibility have score we as have few people on long term sickness benefit than would otherwise have be the case 
 the former health minister lord bethell say that he be gobsmacke by the figure and that 
 the economic hit will be hard 
 the minister would do well to listen to his word yesterday the education secretary say that the government can not guarantee that their promise will be meet on childcare which parent need in order to work today their prime minister admit that he have fail on nhs waiting list which the long term sick need deal with if they be to get back to work why do the secretary of state not do the decent thing and admit that he have fail too and adopt labour ’s plan to cut wait roll out breakfast club overhaul jobcentre and get britain work again 
 we be get britain work unlike the opposition under whose last administration unemployment increase youth unemployment go up by some more woman be unemployed and people or thereabout be stick on long term benefit for almost a decade that be a disgrace 
 sizewell c will provide an enormous number of job opportunity in suffolk will my right hon friend outline the work that the department for work and pensions be do to ensure that local people have every opportunity to work on the project and acquire the necessary skill 
 like my hon friend i be excited about the job and opportunity at sizewell local jobcentre have be engage with sizewell c and i understand that a local partnership manager will be designate to promote opportunity and to find people for apprenticeship and thousand of job we will invest in local skill through sector base work programme and the like 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 last month a report by the pension provider royal london show that woman lose on average £ as a result of juggle part time work and childcare what be the government go to do about that 
 as the hon gentleman will have hear early the proportion of woman save for their pension have go from year ago to now 
 people with disability often take on voluntary role as there can be societal barrier to gain employment my constituent philippa have a son with down ’s syndrome who volunteer provide much value music workshop for local child how can the minister ensure that the work of people with disability be properly recognise in the workplace 
 i congratulate philippa ’s son on the very good work that he do we have disability employment adviser in our jobcentre i be visit my hon friend ’s constituency later this week i know that he have be involve in the denbighshire project include the we mind the gap programme for young people and i will be interested to discuss that and other matter 
 fife gingerbread base in my constituency contact i to point out that most of the provision in the child support collection domestic abuse act which be unanimously agree by the house and receive royal assent at the end of june last year have still not be bring into force that mean that far too many vulnerable people who want to make a claim through the child maintenance service find that abusive ex partner use it to control their behaviour why be it take so long to put in place the measure in the act 
 i can confirm to the hon gentleman that the child maintenance service have a domestic abuse plan to ensure that parent be not place in danger as a consequence of any suggestion of domestic violence for example it have a centralised sort code to limit the risk of parental involvement 
 i wish to place on record my thank to the secretary of state for help to guide my private member ’s bill through parliament it lower the pension auto enrolment age from to and abolish the low earning threshold briefly have the secretary of state receive reassurance from the chancellor that the necessary form will be implement in the spring budget 
 i thank my hon friend for that question those matter be under active consideration 
 give that the secretary of state have just say that the continuation of the household support fund after the end of march be up to the chancellor and give that last week we have the support of all party in westminster hall for   the continuation of this vital fund will he assure the house that the subject be a top priority in his negotiation with the chancellor 
 the specific of my negotiation with the treasury remain between i and the treasury as i have say the any of those decision on the hsf be matter for the treasury 
 in the dwp fail to make a reasonable decision about target information at the woman affect by state pension age change the ombudsman rule that there be maladministration these woman in dudley and around the country deserve more than just an apology do the minister accept these finding and if not will he explain why not 
 the department be co operate with the parliamentary and health service ombudsman investigation which be ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment on it or the outcome 
 my constituent ’s universal credit payment have be stop over christmas for year run because her employer pay her salary early in december why will ministers not do more to ensure that caseworker know that they can use the discretion that they have so that my constituent and other like she have financial certainty at what be a very difficult time of year 
 the way that universal credit work mean that work coach can use their flexibility but if a payment be short month the appropriate thing to do be to sort it the next 
 in his opening remark the secretary of state mention the assessment period for cost of living payment but people on weekly pay schedule miss out on support because they fall foul of the assessment period rule for universal credit what assessment have the government make of the number of people miss out and what remedy do they have 
 cost of living payment can be affect by when people be pay and therefore by whether they be on universal credit and qualify at precisely that point i do not have the figure to hand that the hon lady request but i will of course get back to she with it 
 this morning ’s report by the academy of medical sciences reveal that our appalling child health and infant mortality rate be bad than those of of   similar country and be the key driver of child poverty what assessment have the secretary of state undertake to make on the impact that stop the household support fund in april will have on relative child poverty and subsequently infant mortality 
 as the hon lady will know the number of those in child poverty have decrease by since we do not yet have a decision on the household support fund to which she refer but i point she to the very significant uplift in the local housing allowance which will give people £ a year more on average thereby take many of they out of poverty 
 from unanswered email to unreturned call it have be heartbreaking to hear from so many vulnerable constituent who be in a state of limbo and distress and try to chase up personal independence payment when will minister ensure that people can get the support that they need in a timely and straightforward manner 
 if the hon gentleman have specific example i would be keen to hear from he and to look into they 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 will the secretary of state point out to the chancellor that many council have use the household support fund to pay £ per day per child during the school holiday to family entitle to free school meal and that if the fund close at the end of march those family will be straight into hardship in the easter school holiday 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his representation and indeed would be grateful for any other that he be minded to make to i as we conduct our ongoing review on where we go with the household support fund 
 when will the minister wake up to the fact that work as an apprentice in engineering be a fabulous career choice and well pay will she come up to huddersfield to look at cummins whose apprentice system be rate 
 i would be delighted to do so on my tour of england i could not agree more with the hon gentleman my father be an engineer it be a fantastic profession and the more we can encourage apprenticeship right across the board the well nearly people have now take they up i would be delighted to come 
 with permission i will make a statement on the recent response to houthi aggression in the red sea 
 freedom of navigation have be a cornerstone of civilisation since time immemorial it underpin our prosperity and security and be a found principle of the international rule base system since   october the houthis supply and aid by iran have be infringe on those fundamental freedom by attack international commercial vessel in the red sea and in the gulf of aden on   november they illegally seize the merchant vessel galaxy leader use a helicopter bear assault crew and since then they have conduct around attack against commercial and military vessel despite repeat warning their attack have continue 
 the uk have always stand up for the rule base international order and since the houthis begin their illegal attack we have be at the forefront of the international response whether help to defend vessel in the vicinity as of the member to join the us lead taskforce operation prosperity guardian or work in tandem with the us and other ally to tackle the houthis always in response to specific threat and always in line with international law and the principle of self defence 
 on previous occasion we have be require to use force and those attack have have a significant effect in degrade houthi capability but the houthis intent to continue disrupt the red sea have not be fully diminish week ago the prime minister come to the house to make it clear as i do the follow day that unless the houthis desist from their inflammatory action we would not hesitate to act again yet instead of cease their activity they have choose to persist accompany their increasingly incendiary rhetoric with further missile and drone target at shipping and at the royal navy 
 most recently the houthis set the vessel marlin luanda on fire and target hms diamond directly in the red sea such behaviour be simply intolerable it break international law and be already have consequence that be damaging to the economy of the world insurance premium have rocket tenfold since the start of december the number of cargo ship transit bab al mandab have fall and the cost of container have rocket all of which could send food inflation spiral and will certainly hit those country with the great poverty level the hard 
 the houthis believe that they be the region ’s robin hood but as i discuss with the yemeni defence minister just yesterday when i see he in saudi the only people they be rob be innocent yeminis whose food and aid arrive via the red sea that be why at the weekend the prime minister and i again authorise the use of force in strict accordance with international law and in self defence on saturday royal air force typhoons support by voyager tanker join the us force to conduct further precision strike against houthi location in yemen the typhoons employ paveway iv precision guide munition against    military facility hit separate target which be identify after careful intelligence analysis at those location and approve by i 
 at as salif due west of sana’a on the red sea coast our aircraft target a ground control station inside a defensive position the station have be use to control houthi attack and reconnaissance drone launch from far inland and operate over the red sea target at international shipping a drone ground control station be confirm to be al munirah on the same stretch of coastline as with as salif the station provide direct control of reconnaissance and attack drone target shipping in the red sea its position on the coast allow it to maintain the line of sight datum link use to target innocent shipping with accuracy 
 our typhoons also attack a significant number of target at bani the house may recall that an initial group of facility at bani be successfully strike by the raf on the night of   january   this year since then a further set of building at the site have be positively confirm to be involve in the houthi operation and be as a result target on this occasion as be standard practice for operation by the raf the strike be very carefully plan to ensure minimal risk of civilian casualty drop munition at night far reduce such risk and we do not believe there be any civilian casualty on saturday night 
 military action can only be element in our effort to confront these global challenge and military action be indeed the very last resort it would be far well if the houthis stop their attack our approach be therefore found on pillar we be increase diplomatic engagement the foreign secretary travel to the region and meet his iranian counterpart last month to make it clear that iran must cease supply the houthis with weapon and intelligence and use its influence to stop the houthi attack the prime minister speak to president biden recently to discuss our joint approach and i meet my counterpart in the region this weekend return this morning from the kingdom of saudi arabia where i discuss regional security 
 secondly we must end the illegal flow of arm to the houthis britain and the us have previously intercept weapon shipment in the region include the same kind of component that we have see use in recent strike thirdly we must cut off the houthis financial resource we have already we do so last month sanction key figure within the houthi regime include the commander of the houthi naval force and the houthi defence minister 
 fourthly we continue to help the people of yemen deliver humanitarian aid and support a negotiate peace the uk have commit £ in humanitarian support so far this year feed yemenis every month with aid arrive through the very sea route which ironically the houthis be target 
 let i be absolutely clear we would much rather the houthis simply stop attack international shipping stop damage global trade and stop harm the prospect of their own people at the same time appease the houthis today will not lead to a more stable red sea or indeed a more stable region we be not seek confrontation and we urge the houthis and all those who enable they to stop these illegal and unacceptable attack however if necessary the uk will not hesitate to respond again in self defence 
 placate the sponsor of terror do not benefit our international order in the long run or bring peace to the middle east or elsewhere in europe or the world the truth be that we can not ignore the importance of these great waterway for shipping that be the reason the world back the united nations convention on the law of the sea it be the reason new zealand have join the uk the us australia canada bahrain denmark and the netherlands in provide support to this weekend ’s air strike as an island nation we have always appreciate freedom of navigation and the fact that it be intrinsic to our way of life if we do not deal with these threat every nation will be poor i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the defence secretary for the advance copy of his statement 
 we back the uk us airstrike that take place at the weekend to protect shipping in the red sea we know that the strike be carry out against houthi command centre and weapon store we accept that they be limited necessary and target to minimise the risk of civilian casualty the houthis be attack the ship of many nation threaten maritime security and international trade and put civilian and military life in serious danger that be why the un security council pass last month a resolution condemn houthi action in the strong possible term and demand that their attack stop 
 we accept that the strike we justify but will the defence secretary confirm that they be also effective be the target select the target hit be the purpose of destroy the drone control centre at as salif and al munirah fully achieve minister have say that the aim of the strike be to deter houthi attack and secondly to degrade their capability the aim have not yet succeed as houthi attack continue but be the fact that those attack be now less sophisticated and more sporadic a sign that the aim may be succeed this be the uk us strike in the past week at what stage do off strike become a sustained campaign if this do develop into continue military action at what stage will the government give parliament a say 
 before i turn to the wide role of uk force in the red sea let i make this point it be the prime minister who should be make this statement to the house just as he do after the previous uk strike on houthi target it be the prime minister ’s responsibility to authorise such uk military action in the name of the cabinet advise by other of course include and especially the defence secretary the government risk downgrade respect for the convention that have give the go ahead for such action it be the prime minister who then report directly to this house 
 we also back the lead role of the royal navy in the continue defence of shipping from all nation in the red sea what action be the government take to persuade other country to join the prosperity guardian protection force how long do the defence secretary expect operation prosperity guardian to be need   how will the eu ’s new maritime mission to the red sea co ordinate operation with prosperity guardian week ago i ask the defence secretary if a uk carrier be ready to deploy to the red sea we now know that hms queen elizabeth have serious problem so do the uk still have the option of send a carrier to the red sea if require and if so when military action on its own can not solve the problem in the region what be the government ’s diplomatic action to pressure the houthis to cease their attack and settle the civil war in yemen and to pressure iran to stop supply weapon and intelligence to the houthis 
 finally like the defence secretary i totally reject the houthi claim that fire missile and drone at ship from around the world be somehow link to the conflict in gaza they have be attack oil tanker and seize ship for at least year not just for the day since   october those attack do absolutely nothing for the palestinian people whose agony be now extreme we want the gaza fighting to stop now with a humanitarian truce that can build into a sustainable ceasefire to stop the killing of innocent civilian get all the remain hostage out and get much more aid into gaza the uk aid effort must be accelerate have any more raf flight take off since the defence secretary be last in this chamber and if not why not 
 finally for long term peace there have to be a political process that can turn the rhetoric around state live side by side in peace into reality the house be unite in that uk vision and i give this commitment from our side if elect to form the next government labour will lead this new push for peace 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s support for this action he ask a series of question which i will rattle through be the action effective yes they hit the target be all the target hit again yes we be still carry out surveillance to find out the exact impact but i think we can be very confident that all the relevant objective be reach we combine very closely with our us colleague and sometimes interchange some of those target with they the right hon gentleman will have note that on this occasion we be involve in drop munition on more target than previously so we carry a slightly great weight than before 
 the right hon gentleman ask whether the action be successful and rightly point out that what we be see be rather more sporadic the attack include on hms diamond and on merchant shipping have continue but in a much more ad hoc fashion it be perhaps relevant that there have be no attack use multiple different weapon at the same time which we see for example on   january the degrading will have have some impact on that.[official report   february vol c. 3mc correction i will come back to the right hon gentleman ’s comment about the prime minister at the end i want to set the record straight 
 the right hon gentleman ask about operation prosperity guardian the simple answer of course be that none of we know how long it will need to continue for but we want it to come to a conclusion as quickly as possible 
 we utterly reject any notion that these continue attack by the houthis be anything to do with the situation in gaza the houthis be opportunist pirate who be use a situation to their benefit a few year   ago they do not even support hamas but suddenly they want to be their great champion they be over kilometre away from gaza they be simply use the situation to their advantage and it be wise for the house to not over link the none the less the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to about the need to see a humanitarian truce and a sustainable ceasefire that be the government ’s policy we be work extremely hard to try to achieve that include through discussion that the prime minister the foreign secretary and myself be have just yesterday i be have those discussion in the middle east 
 the right hon gentleman ask about raf flight the issue be not get the aid to location i have be work very closely with the cypriot government for example on how we can increase the amount of aid the single big problem remain get the aid into the country we have some success with get kerem shalom open but what we really need to see be ashdod open in order to route that aid to kerem shalom and straight into gaza the government and i will continue to push for that route but the problem be not the flight take off it be the aid get in 
 finally turn to the fact that it be myself as defence secretary stand at the dispatch box rather than the prime minister the thing to say be that it be the secretary of state for defence who actually have legal responsibility for these action who sign off the target and indeed the legal authority technically it be i who should be stand here other than for the couple of round where the prime minister be deal with something new and it be therefore very appropriate for he to be at the dispatch box 
 the wide point that i would gently make to the right hon gentleman though be that the prime minister be in northern ireland today do incredibly important work—[interruption i hear from a sedentary position the suggestion that we should have be recall yesterday but i unsure whether that would have be entirely practical it be entirely appropriate that the prime minister be in northern ireland i would have think that the house would welcome the fact that that historic breakthrough have be mark by the prime minister and it be very appropriate that i be here today to explain the activity of saturday night to the house 
 do the government accept that it be difficult to deter terrorist fanatic and that mainly have to contain the effectiveness of what they do until they be ultimately destroy preferably by our regional ally do the secretary of state feel that there be in fact a link to a separate conflict and that be the conflict in ukraine be it not more than a coincidence that the proxy of russia ’s ally in the middle east have be so much more active while russia be so desperate for we to turn our attention away from support ukraine 
 as ever my right hon friend have absolutely hit the nail on the head russia and iran be work together actually the same kind of drone sometimes the shahed drone that be be fire in ukraine by the russians courtesy of iran be also be fire by the houthis he make an excellent linkage point and he be absolutely right 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the people of scotland and elsewhere on these island deserve to know what the plan be for this crisis in the red sea not the timing the detail of mission the tactical ambition or the resource behind these but the broad strategy be pursue with lethal force in our name and in the absence of parliamentary approval we have already make it clear from the snp benches that we support the government and international partner in direct action to uphold freedom of navigation and the law of the sea but this should never have be take for grant and it remain subject to a realistic interpretation of both self defence and imminence 
 we see the toll that russia ’s illegal invasion of ukraine have take on our constituent and business over energy cost so we can not allow this to be compound far by interrupt global supply chain nor can we ever tolerate or stand idly by while seafarer be put at risk whatever the suppose aim of the houthis or their backer may be 
 will this be a sustained engagement i do not know and neither do the rest of parliament way or another an ally seaborne strike capability will be engage so with of the aircraft carrier in the royal navy out of commission again the type frigate fleet on its knee and the type destroyer fleet still go through pip the power improvement project who in the government have a grip of the royal navy ’s resource fundamentally what be the uk government ’s plan to ensure that this campaign be not escalatory and what be the thinking behind any assessment that they have make 
 in closing this be not about support gazans or people die or flee persecution in gaza but about the houthis pursue their own aim however i would be interested to know what the government ’s assessment be of the uptick in temperature in the middle east in gaza in yemen and with nato ally personnel be kill 
 listen carefully to the hon gentleman i detect that he support the action that have be take as i have say it can not be right that international shipping be prevent from its own freedom of navigation again respect the will of the house and listen very carefully it be quite clear that the official opposition support this action as do the government and as i now learn do those on his own bench and i remember the liberal democrats say it previously so i think it be quite clear that there be a strong support in this house it be also important that there be sufficient freedom of action to ensure the safety and security of our airman and woman when they undertake these action rather than flag they substantially in advance 
 the hon gentleman mention and so do   the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey the aircraft carrier and i should just address this point it be the case that actually through an abundance of caution on a final inspection the decision be take for the aircraft carrier not to sail i have speak to the sea lord who have make it clear to i that if there have be an emergency situation the house will recall that it be go to join exercise steadfast defender it quite probably would have sail the fact be that we have another and that will sail to the exercise 
 on the frigate and the destroyer i just disagree with the hon gentleman i have be out to visit those on hms diamond in the red sea and they be absolutely prepared and ready to go 
 that ’s 
 as the hon gentleman say that be but today that ship have be replace by hms richmond which now take on that mantle we have ship under construction or on order i wonder how many we would get from the snp with its approach to defence 
 i thank my right hon friend for his in depth statement but there be concern about stretch the royal navy it be a lead world class navy but it be suffer from personnel issue in crew the ship and responsibility for that lie back at the treasury provide the revenue stream need to make sure the capital equipment we have get can be use most effectively what representation be my right hon friend make to ensure that the growth in maritime concern around the world will be meet by a commitment from the treasury 
 on a wide armed force and mod note we have £ for equipment over the next year my right hon friend be absolutely right that that have to be match with the sailor the airman and woman and the army able to resource that equipment and i have some good news for he since we have be talk very actively about these issue we have see an year high in application to the royal navy a year high in application to the army and a increase between this january and last january in application to join the royal air force i predict we be make progress 
 i wonder whether the secretary of state have see the front page of the financial times today because it outline how iran have be use lloyds and santander account to evade sanction the us be accuse front company of fund the irgc with hundred of million of dollar and work with russian intelligence to raise money for iranian proxy i be sure all in this house would be appal to know that money launder here in our capital be be use against our own troop by the houthis so what assessment have the government make of those allegation by our ally do that not yet again show that we must proscribe the irgc now 
 this issue be repeatedly raise in the house and the hon lady will know as she will have hear the response many time before that we do not routinely comment on proscription it be the case however that we do sanction and we have sanction the entirety of the irgc already as well as take a number of different action she will appreciate that this matter do not come directly within the defence portfolio but i know that she will have the opportunity to press foreign office and home office ministers at a future time and we do keep this matter under constant review 
 i agree with the secretary of state and the government that we do not want to see an escalation in the region and that we want to be proportionate in our response and calibrate our response not to provoke and antagonise but be it not the case that we might actually be hit the wrong target that we be hit proxy of iran and while i believe in peace and diplomacy the malevolent factor in the region in all of this be iran it might be the case that while we have the good of diplomatic intention and we do not want to provoke iran to a major conflict with nato the us or the uk put off that decision now will cost more life in the future iran and the regime not the iranian people but the regime in iran be behind all this they be the one destabilise israel the abraham accord and so on i hope the secretary of state will take a strategic view and make hard choice on iran because whether we like it or not it be come 
 my right hon friend make the excellent point that iran be behind all this iran be behind hamas hezbollah the houthis and the irgc align militia that we have see attack not just american troop i often hear it be american personnel have be attack separate time in syria and iraq but in fact about a of those occasion involve british troop as well on every occasion iran be behind all of this i absolutely agree with my right hon friend and we be work hard to pressurise iran into realise that its current approach can do no good at all and will destabilise the region which it claim it do not want to do 
 let i make the point that a direct attack on iran would be insanity the region would be provoke and other would be drag into it i understand why the government be say that it be wise to not over link houthis strike with gaza but the reality be that the middle east region be on the edge of conflagration as a result of the war that be go on and the attack on gaza the priority must therefore be to secure peace in gaza we have a limited role in that but we know that netanyahu would secure peace if pressurise to do so by the american government because realistically they be the only power that can influence he and israeli strategy what further talk have take place with the biden government to ensure that they exercise the maximum pressure on netanyahu to get to that peace negotiate table 
 the right hon gentleman will be aware i hope that the uk and the us work very closely on this i be in the states last week i meet blinken lloyd austin and other to discuss exactly the point that the right hon gentleman raise about how we bring together a solution that not only provide ultimately the palestinian state for the palestinian people but security guarantee for israel it be also important to realise that we be work closely in a number of different sphere include on the lebanese border where we be work hard to try to prevent a further conflict there we should remember that israelis have have to move from that border because of the activity of lebanese hezbollah we be work with the lebanese government i see the yemeni defence minister yesterday and we discuss how to prevent that conflict from become part of this too the government be pull every single possible diplomatic lever in what be clearly a very complex position 
 the defence secretary be right that this mission must continue to stand up and defend international law in the red sea but the mission to remove the houthi threat and keep the red sea safe could last month and it be not sustainable to continue task typhoons from cyprus for each mission or subsequent future threat will the defence secretary therefore agree that there be a case for an urgent operational requirement to upgrade the type-45 destroyer give the continued inability of their vertical launch system to strike target at range inland 
 i know that my right hon friend take a huge interest in this matter and he will be interested to hear that on friday i be on hms somerset in devonport where they be fit a surface to surface system which may or may not be appropriate in this particular type of conflict i want to take issue with thing we be in a coalition here work with the us and other as we have demonstrate repeatedly there be no issue with typhoons fly a long distance indeed when america carry out their unrelated attack for tower they fly all the way from the united states fly a long distance be no sign that the capability be not there in itself 
 will the secretary of state please have another go at give a well answer to the question from   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   about the extremely serious report in today ’s financial times that of britain ’s main bank be indirectly help to fund the houthis with whom we be now in some sort of conflict 
 the right hon gentleman will have hear my answer a moment ago i know that he want i to go into further detail but i be unable to do that at the dispatch box right now we have note both the question and the article of this morning we be also intensely engage in find the good way to ensure that iranian influence whether through the uk or in the region be limited i do not think i can go far at this moment 
 the houthi rebel be violent extremist antisemite and it be right that we take action to combat their aggression in the red sea it seem that there be success in degrade their capability be the secretary of state confident that we will get to the point where we can stop the attack altogether 
 i think the clock be run down for the houthis in as much as their ability be be degrade as my right hon friend point out they do not have the eye and ear from the radar station they be more reliant still on iran and only the uk and the us have do interdiction of their weapon there be a limitation to this none the less we still think that would continue if they choose to even at that low level but it be important that they cease and stop this we be put pressure on as i have describe through every possible mean include very extensive talk that i have yesterday in saudi arabia with various different people include not just the saudis but the yemenis themselves 
 will the secretary of state confirm what the long term strategy be and how it relate to the ongoing precarious situation in yemen do the government plan to commit to sustained military action if so surely it be only right for parliament to have its say in the appropriate way 
 this be the time that we have come to parliament and make a statement i know that the hon lady have make other contribution to the debate so we do feel that parliament be be fully engage in the process we be not look to make this a sustained long term military action indeed i can guarantee for the house that if the houthis stop we will have absolutely no requirement again to drop munition on they but it be a fact that they be the one interrupt international maritime activity and we can not stand by and allow that to happen 
 the defence secretary can not comment specifically on target acquisition but will he please confirm to the house that our intelligence surveillance target acquisition and reconnaissance be focus on those houthi capability directly engage in the attack on international shipping be it reasonable to assume that further degradation of those capability will result in increase security in the red sea 
 my hon friend ask a good question that have not yet be ask the answer be yes we be look carefully and the location choose on this occasion be indeed from a combination of us and uk intelligence 
 the government be right to have this strong response for what may seem to many to be a faraway war or incident but which could impact so much on people ’s life here in the united kingdom through food shortage supply chain disruption and inflation give the report about shortage of royal navy personnel the difficulty with munition the difficulty with some ship and now the increase demand on the navy because of tension with china and russia maybe even argentina in future will the secretary of state assure we that we have the capability to play our part in keep supply chain open what discussion have he have with other ally to get they involve in the task of support we in this job 
 the right hon gentleman be right about the importance of trade some of our good come to this country via the sea so it really matter to the united kingdom but it matter to the whole world he mention personnel munition and so on as have or other member in my time as defence secretary i have not be unable to deploy exactly where i have need to for example at the request of nato when we deploy to kosovo they have return home now or for this conflict in the middle east where we have need to carry out the action that we be discuss on each occasion those have be available i previously mention a £ year programme on equipment and the success in recruit more personnel i encourage other country to match our defence budget which be comfortably above of gdp and head up to 2.5%—the soon they do that the well 
 i fully support the government ’s action in the red sea the irony of the iranian regime accuse we of destabilise the region through our action will not be lose on reasonable people do the secretary of state agree that those demonstrator on the street of london applaud what the houthi rebel have be do be at good useful idiot and at bad truly the enemy within 
 i use my own language but it be disgraceful to see people go out and support those who be indiscriminately fire at merchant ship that be absolutely appalling i will not repeat my hon friend ’s language i will put that support down to ignorance rather than anything else 
 the secretary of state be rightly clear about breach of international law by the houthis in the red sea can he be equally clear about breach of international law by all side in gaza do he think it will help reduce hostility across the middle east if the government can build a broad international coalition in support of their diplomatic and military aim 
 the united kingdom government always want international humanitarian law to be adhere to and we make that point repeatedly to every side in this conflict i think the hon gentleman be drive at israel to answer his question directly israel be include hamas could end the conflict very quickly if they release the hostage that they have kidnap and cease fire on israel on the wide coalition i describe how new zealand be now on board with the military action but i should mention that plus country be involve in operation prosperity guardian and the eu have form an additional operation which we welcome 
 far to the question from my hon friend   the member for ipswich tom hunt as well as open support for the houthis this weekend on the street of central london some protestor in the pro palestinian march again call for an intifada and hold up deeply racist antisemitic sign of which include inform israelis we presume jewish israelis that they be indigenous to nowhere other than hell i be not sure that it be just ignorance i think something more sinister be at play among some of the protestor we should call it what it be pure and simple jew hate will the secretary of state inform the house whether he have speak to anyone else across government about more action to deal with some of the hate on our street 
 the home secretary continuously keep this matter under review and meet police chief to ensure that they have the power to combat what my hon friend rightly describe as absolutely disgusting behaviour which have no place at all on our street i be sure that the whole house need no reminding but perhaps the people who go out campaigning do the houthis slogan be death to america death to israel death to the jews no matter where they be there be no place for that on the street of britain 
 it be an extraordinary situation where the secretary of state come here make a matter of fact statement about the   launch of missile against a number of target and country give no indication of the long term war aim by the uk at present and say absolutely nothing about the crying desperate need for a ceasefire to protect the people of gaza from further death and destruction do he not realise that the extension of the conflict by britain and the united states to at least other country risk a huge conflagration across the whole region i would have be much happy have he come here and say that britain be determined to try to deal with the injustice in the region and to bring about a peace process rather than further militarisation of the seaway around all those country surely peace be something to aim for rather than the continuation of yet more war 
 never have i disagree so much with the right hon gentleman and that be say something give that he want to scrap trident and pull we out of nato the statement be on the red sea i be surprised that he be not more appreciative of the geography the attack in the red sea be a very long way from gaza he misunderstand why i have come to this house to talk about munition on a single country not country as he say i speak to the yemeni government yesterday who thank we for our work it be a shame that he can not do the same 
 i commend the defence secretary for his excellent work he talk about yemen its foreign minister ahmad awad bin mubarak say on thursday that there be no doubt that iran ’s quds force operative have be deploy to his own coastline what assessment have my right hon friend make of the extent of iran ’s aggressive military adventurism and its destabilising effect on international peace and security 
 quite simply iran be a malign influence not just on yemen but on the entire region my right hon and learn friend be right to point out the manner in which it have help to create instability in the red sea i be afraid that the only language that the iranians understand be the approach that we have be take to show they that there be a red line and they have cross it 
 i completely understand and agree with the need to protect international shipping and maritime security and to ensure the safety of civilian and seafarer in the red sea however some of we be also concerned about a wide escalation in this already volatile region will the defence secretary outline what step the government be take diplomatic or otherwise to stop we be suck into an escalating regional conflict 
 the action we be discuss be very specific and target as the hon gentleman will recognise they be not open to be repeat unless the attack on we continue so they can actually be stop immediately in term of wide diplomacy which i have go into in some detail i have meet with sullivan blinken and lloyd austin in the states while the foreign secretary have be do the same with his opposite number as i have just describe i be in the region until this morning where i be have extensive discussion on how to bring this situation to a conclusion i be afraid   it be not always possible to provide a line by line explanation of every single element of those talk which i appreciate be frustrating for the house but we be make broad and strenuous effort to achieve exactly what the hon gentleman be look for
