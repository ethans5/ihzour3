i have be contact by multiple constituent who arrive in the uk via the arap scheme they be extremely worried about their relative the hardship they have experience and the threat of danger with the recent event in pakistan these case range from somebody who work for the british armed force for year a family member who be pregnant with child and a judge who have previously be in prison under the taliban will the minister agree to look at those case and will he also say whether he have the resource to resolve these matter urgently 
 the government be out of idea and without direction either unwilling or unable to make the big decision to give we a bright future what a waste opportunity especially when it come to action to tackle the nature and climate crisis what well opportunity be there to empower community and business to break down barrier to tackle the big issue of our generation i be pleased that the government announce recently that they will introduce a nature gcse but consider the abysmal nature of what be in the king ’s speech on tackle the climate crisis it seem to i that the prime minister should be the person to take it 
 climate education should not stop with school local authority could organise citizen assembly as we have propose many time there be so many opportunity to educate people about the danger of our not get this right and fail to reach our ° target by but those on the government front bench continue to ignore they they continue too to ignore the opportunity that would arise from a green transition a nature or climate gcse could grow the career and skill we need to tackle the climate emergency and get to net but this government ’s attitude be that everyone except they must meet their commitment 
 rather than protect our child ’s future the government be protect the interest of the fossil fuel giant how can they seriously claim to be leader on net action while introduce legislation to hold annual oil and gas licensing round that be particularly shocking when compare with their unforgivable failure to allocate a single new contract for difference for onshore wind farm in the recent auction round i would like to hear how the new legislation will bring down energy bill for a single of my constituent research from uplift confirm that most of the oil produce at rosebank will be ship abroad and sell on the global market to the high bidder it will secure the future of the oil and gas giant but not the uk ’s energy supply 
 not only do the new offshore petroleum licensing bill fly in the face of our climate commitment but it will have wide range and long term negative impact on the sustainability of our ocean and marine life as i say we need education on this across the house and across the board in all our community educate young child be a good start but it seem to i that a lot more of the old generation need that education too 
 when will this tory government embrace the clean green energy of the future and stop delay our path to net we need more grid capacity and more government action to capitalise on green job and technology new green job do not fall out of the sky they start with proper career option for young people that they can start now so that we can see the energy transformation we need 
 we hear from tory ministers that they hope to attract more investment in renewable but their word do not match their action we can not afford for our government to miss any more of their own target that too should be part of our education that if we say we will do something we should actually deliver we must take people with we on the green transition and education be the step 
 there be so many untapped opportunity uk solar power deployment be already significantly behind target the smart export guarantee should incentivise household to invest in solar panel by allow they to sell the excess electricity they produce back to the grid at a well price and recover the cost of their investment much fast again educate householder in how they can invest in the net transition be an important part of the puzzle if we do not communicate properly with our citizen about what they can do to tackle the climate crisis where will we be 
 under the current system it take decade for householder to break even householder be confused and we need to ensure that there be trust source where they can obtain information about how to tackle the climate crisis and break down the barrier that we be discuss today there must be that change to bring about the revolution in rooftop solar that carry so many benefit for people and the planet the cheap energy be the energy that we do not use and reduce energy waste will lower bill and cut carbon emission we urgently need to upgrade our housing stock to guarantee warm and comfortable home for everyone long into the future 
 in private renter live in fuel poverty and child be live in privately rent cold damp or mouldy home landlord have contact i say that they can not afford to upgrade their property to energy efficient standard that too be just a bit of education a bit of knowledge that we must share as a matter of urgency i believe that local council be well place to be the trust source of that type of information but the government must see they as partner and people to engage with and give they the opportunity and resource that they need in order to share the information that be so badly need in our community 
 some subsidy scheme be available to landlord but they be not open to all landlord and they can be difficult to access we liberal democrats propose that all landlord should be allow to offset their spending on insulation and energy save improvement against their income tax only through well target incentive for landlord will we make the difference for tenant who be struggle to pay their bill if the government disagree with our proposal i ask they to suggest an alternative all we have see so far be that from landlord will no long need to meet the energy performance certificate c standard 
 there have be yet more delay when will we see action to ensure that family do not live in poor quality housing that be badly insulate make their energy bill more expensive we need the landlord on board we need a government who be prepared to use both a carrot and a stick and we need a government who be prepared to put out the necessary information and enable it to be pool and i would say yet again that council be well place to do that e3 g have find that raise the energy standard to c rating for privately   rent home would save bill payer about £ a year the government should hold firm and help landlord to meet these target and keep home warm this winter 
 since the last king ’s speech we have not reduce our dependence on oil and gas we have not allow household to make more sustainable choice we have not put out that important piece of education that people need we have not organise the citizen assembly for the sharing of information that we require so urgently and we have not protect household from rise energy bill too many household face another difficult winter the government ’s failure to deliver be become their trademark and judge by the king ’s speech that will not change any time soon although i still hold out hope that it will the government should prove i wrong or right 
 let i make some progress before i take intervention 
 early this year we announce the large ever investment in childcare in england ’s history very soon we will be spend £ a year that investment will ensure that every child get the good start in life it mean that work parent will be entitle to hour of free childcare from the end of parental leave until their child start school to give parent the flexibility they need we be roll out universal wraparound childcare for primary school child from am to pm these conservative policy will end the choice that some work mum and dad feel they need to make between have a family and have a career and it will save parent up to £ a year 
 the generation have child now will not remember what be on offer under labour but let i remind the house year of labour deliver only hour of free childcare for some and year old that be less than hour for every year in office our childcare package give people want to start a family the confidence to do so may i invite   the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner when she stand at the dispatch box to finally offer labour ’s support for our record childcare investment can she tell hard work parent in wales why her party be not roll out the same support that english parent will benefit from 
 i know that the right hon lady like i do not grow up with privilege i have hear she speak eloquently and passionately about the help and support she receive from sure start and i know she be grateful for that support i be sure there be many positive from that programme indeed my good friend use to run a sure start centre but there be also some serious failing in the design and delivery sure start be not a universal offer and it stigmatise people who use the service plus it only help family for the year of a child ’s life but any parent will say that challenge can arise at any time interruption this be important the national audit office find that sure start have fail to target the most disadvantaged family and be even unable to identify family need support in the most disadvantaged of community it simply do not reach the right people 
 when we launch our family hub programme we ensure that the hub provide a service to anyone who need it they be support family with everything from mental health to breastfeed and housing and debt service challenge that many of we need support with the service be universal available to anyone family hub support family with child of all age from conception to or up to for those with special educational need they join up service ensure that every family get the right support at the right time as part of that the good start for life programme provide focus support during the crucial day of a child ’s life and i pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom   for her work to get that right 
 before i talk about how we have transform our school i will address of the key challenge we face in deliver opportunity school attendance 
 i will in a moment honestly but this be important i want to address of the key challenge we face which be school attendance follow the   pandemic we have see a phenomenon where more child be stay home and not go to school that challenge be not unique to the uk at the g7 my counterpart from the us to japan be all grapple with the same issue i reassure the house that it be a top priority we be make progress through our attendance hub and mentor programme as well as more specialised support for key cohort such as those with mental health issue or special educational need in just the past year few child be persistently absent and we will keep drive at this issue until all our child be back in school 
 i notice that the labour party have a lot to say about attendance this morning but   the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson   may have miss the few child persistently absent in the past year yet again labour offer little more than empty word with a touch of student politic in labour run wales attendance rate be still far behind those in england last year ’s attendance datum show that wales only manage an attendance rate of compare with england ’s that mean that english child be benefit from well over a week more education than those just over the border i advise the labour party to spend a little less time play politic and more time help child the child of wales deserve well 
 on monday i officially open the constituency garden of remembrance in new palace yard i thank those of you who have already plant remembrance tribute for those who have not yet do so you or a member of your team be welcome to plant a remembrance tribute before pm on thursday at pm today there will be a wreath lay service at the recording angel memorial under the stain glass window at the st stephen ’s entrance end of westminster hall this be the main memorial to member and staff of both houses include police officer who die in both world war all be welcome to attend

 urgent question to ask the home secretary if she will make a statement on the evacuation of afghans from pakistan 
 i thank the hon lady for her question 
 the government have react decisively and swiftly to relocate people to safety in the united kingdom follow the collapse of afghanistan the year before last the uk government remain committed to relocate eligible afghans and their family under the afghan relocation and assistance policy and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme and we will continue to honour that promise the government ’s policy rightly be to ensure that eligible afghan family have secure accommodation in the uk before travel be facilitate for their relocation we want to give they the good possible start to their new life to provide the good value for money for the taxpayer and to ensure afghans be integrate into uk society in the good manner available 
 however development in the region have impact our security assessment and previous assumption that have lead to the government ’s remove the need for settle accommodation for individual eligible under arap prior to relocation to the united kingdom the safety and security of arap eligible afghans have always be of paramount importance and we make no apology at all for change the policy to react to the change context 
 the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence continue to work to ensure that eligible individual under the arap and the acr scheme be support in pakistan the safety and security of arap and acrs eligible afghans be paramount in our mind the mod continue to monitor the security assessment in that country but follow this cross government decision the prime minister have ask i to co ordinate across government to support the mod in develop a new relocation plan for arap eligible person as member know previously the policy be that only those who have secure accommodation in the united kingdom would travel to the united kingdom we be change that policy as a result of change condition on the ground 
 the mod have work hard to stand up a total of more than service family accommodation for mixed purpose or transitory and settled accommodation i pay tribute to the minister for armed forces my right hon friend   the member for wells james heappey for his work on that our new plan will see approximately arap entitle personnel move from pakistan to the united kingdom by the end of december entitle personnel may move straight into settle accommodation on the mod where service family accommodation be unavailable family will move into transitional accommodation as a step where sfa be not suit to the need of arap entitle personnel alternative accommodation will be procure 
 this prime minister and this government be determined to see through our commitment to those who serve with the uk force in afghanistan i commend this statement to the house 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker 
 i be afraid that the minister ’s answer give no reassurance whatsoever to constituent who have contact i in a state of extreme panic over the last few week member have have no information on what be currently happen it have be clear for some time that pakistan aim to expel afghans who go there for safety back to afghanistan i have be try to get clarity on how many people there be in pakistan to whom we have a duty and an obligation and who be wait for the uk government simply to process their paperwork so that they can leave and come to their family here in the uk i have not have those answer from the minister 
 constituent contact i whose sister and her child have be threaten with imprisonment in pakistan if they do not leave her other family member her parent her brother and her cousin have be return to afghanistan and she can not contact they she do not know where they be or what have happen to they give that they flee from the taliban in the place she be terrify for they she have be give very unclear advice by uk official in pakistan on what exactly they be entitle to and whether they will be able to get on a flight at all 
 another constituent a gentleman contact i on   october   after see the news that there will be charter flight from pakistan carry afghans who have be process he have be try to get answer on the status of his family include whether they have a valid application whether they can get on a plane and whether they can come to safety with he he be stick there with his family at the fall of afghanistan and he be extremely distressed about the situation again i have be ask question of various departments and have have no answer whatsoever what advice should i give to my constituent 
 there have be no update to mps despite there be report in the news of charter flight and of people come we have also hear on the news that people in islamabad people who be entitle have be warn by the foreign commonwealth and development office to hide indoor the british high commission have apparently warn people in hotel in islamabad not to go outside due to the risk of arrest and deportation so who be eligible for these charter flight be it people on the arap and acrs scheme people with valid family reunion paperwork or people who be still wait for their paperwork to be do we do not know and i have family in my constituency with of member who have be process and who have be leave behind can the minister tell we exactly how many people in pakistan be wait for the uk government to process their paperwork so that they can finally come to safety we have a duty to these afghans and we be fail they yet again 
 i must be completely clear to the house that this be not an issue of delayed paperwork afghanistan collapse and the uk conduct operation pitting to retrieve afghans from kabul and bring they to the uk they go into hotel accommodation because we do not have enough housing that be the right thing to do at the time 
 since then it have become clear that it be entirely unsuitable for these family to be in hotel accommodation for long period of time they be therefore hold in   pakistan and rightly so the situation in pakistan have now change and we will now accelerate the process and get they into sfa accommodation in the uk so that we meet our duty 
 i do not want to see anybody detain or deport from pakistan if they be entitle to be in the united kingdom and i will work to achieve that outcome i caution against spread rumour of thing that i be not see on the ground it be an extremely challenging environment but ultimately we have a commitment to these people and i be determined to see it through 
 on the afghan population in hotel i have hear the same question demand and allegation that we would not be successful before but we be i hear the hon lady ’s question but the situation have change we have now change our response and we will relocate these people back to the united kingdom 
 it be reassuring to hear that this be not a paperwork issue because it have now be more than year since the fateful airlift it be also particularly problematic to find accommodation for afghan family because they tend to be large family and the accommodation be not available 
 i be more worried about the change of policy in pakistan and the influence on and within the pakistani government what conversation be minister have with the pakistani government about the aid we pay to pakistan some of which be to cover the many afghan refugee who flee into pakistan to keep they safe and out of danger until we can take those to whom we have a duty surely that should be a subject of conversation with the pakistani government 
 my hon friend be right that those conversation be paramount in our mind give the shift in policy from the pakistani government towards afghans we be drive through protection for those to whom we have a duty where they have be approve to come to the uk we must ensure that we continue our exist agreement with pakistan and the foreign office be work hard to do that now that we have an accelerated plan i hope that those in pakistan who be eligible to be in the uk be protect from any of those policy that we look after they and that we bring they back to the uk as have be our promise from the start 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we owe many afghans a debt of gratitude for support british aim in afghanistan in the summer and autumn of the uk government rightly promise to honour that debt by offer those afghans resettlement in the uk however the government ’s operation warm welcome fast become operation cold shoulder of those afghans who make it to britain be cram into hotel over a year period they be then evict without consultation with local authority leave many afghan family face homelessness this winter 
 bad the prime minister last november personally give instruction to ministers that no more flight should be charter from pakistan to bring afghans who have a right to resettlement here to the uk despite more than afghan refugee be stick in hotel in pakistan when the british government have promise those very individual refuge in the uk through the arap and acr 
 keep those loyal to britain afghans in limbo be shameful enough but even more disgracefully the prime minister change tack only when the pakistani government start threaten to send those loyal to britain afghans back to afghanistan to meet their fate at the hand of the taliban in short the government of pakistan have strong armed our weak prime minister into deliver something that it be our duty as a country to deliver in the place that be a truly shameful and humiliating state of affair 
 what we now need to know from the minister be how many flight have he charter when will they be run from and until what assurance have he receive from the pakistani government that they will extend the deadline for afghans who be to be expel back into afghanistan until after all the uk flight have be complete be the government aware of any case of afghans eligible under arap or acr who have be forcibly return to afghanistan from pakistan if so what step be the government take to bring those people to safety as a matter of urgency finally what progress have he make on clear the record high asylum backlog and secure accommodation for these afghans whom we desperately need to get out of pakistan as rapidly and urgently as possible 
 it be hard to take the hon gentleman seriously when he come out with statement that be demonstrably untrue i know that he would not want to mislead the house but he mention engage local authority and i literally drive round engage they as he well know this stuff be not correct have serve in afghanistan and during the summer have drive round every hotel to visit afghans personally to ensure that none of they sleep homeless and that we see through our duty i will take no lesson from anybody about how we feel towards this afghan cohort clearly i will not go into the detail of which flight be take off when 
 this prime minister and this government be clear that as the situation have change we be seek to get guarantee from the pakistan government that those entitle to be here will not be deport from that country if that do happen the hon gentleman will be able to recall i to this house and i will have fail but that be not go to happen this be much like my promise on homelessness he spend the entire summer say that something would come to fruition but again it never do on this side of the house we have to govern in the real space where we deal with operational decision on a daily basis we can not whip ourselves into a lather to try to score point off some of the poor people in the world we be determined to see through our commitment to the people of afghanistan and i look forward to his work with i in that pursuit 
 the situation with pakistan expel more than afghan people from its border be deeply worrying i be glad that the veterans minister be here today and be go to focus on the very small number of people who may be entitle to come to the uk it will be just a few many hundred of thousand face the threat of need to go back into afghanistan into the hand of the taliban where the economy be in a dreadful position and the country be reel from the earthquake these people   fear for their life what representation be the foreign office and our ally make to the pakistan government to ask they to think again what support be we give to those stick in a humanitarian crisis on the border 
 i will be honest with my hon right hon friend that there be clear distinction in my role to deal with those who be in pakistan who be entitle to be in the united kingdom wide pakistan engagement be a job for the foreign commonwealth and development office which be busily engage in that my priority be to ensure that those who be entitle to be in the uk those who have be approve to come to the united kingdom be not subject to wide pakistan policy in afghanistan but that wide policy be be influence by the foreign office which be work on that every day the situation have change and we be reconfigure ourselves to deal with that to ensure that we honour our promise to people 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 although i welcome the decision may i say to the minister that it would have be much well to tell the house about it in a statement rather than an urgent question we all know the huge pressure on accommodation in the united kingdom and on local council so can the minister say what engagement have take place with local council what do transitional accommodation mean and how do it fit with the home office policy of not use hotel 
 the policy of not use hotel be absolutely right and remain in the summer there be a huge effort to try to remove that barrier to settle into the united kingdom and the policy remain however in extremis that will not be a barrier to people come to the uk where they be at risk of deportation we be go to keep those people safe as we speak we be work up our policy on how to ensure that we integrate this cohort much as we do in the summer discussion with different departments be ongoing when we have agree the policy i will come to the house to share it with everybody i hope it will be along similar line to previous policy but it require collective agreement we will work hard and go around the house to ensure that the afghan family who be in pakistan but entitle to be here be give every opportunity to settle in the uk we have a good record on this and i be determined to keep that go 
 as the minister will know it be my pleasure to work on the removal around operation pitting with colleague from the ministry of defence and the fcdo i welcome the step that the minister have take to finally move many of those people out of hotel it be no secret that back in late i express concern about just put people into hotel and hop offer of accommodation would come forward anyone with any knowledge of housing supply know that the size of the family involve mean that would take some time so i congratulate he on what he do this summer will he reassure i that we be think through what would be suitable family accommodation for the people we be bring into this   country and that we will not just be stick people in hotel intend for businessman to stay in for a couple of night rather than for family to live in for month what type of accommodation do he have in mind for this cohort 
 we will divide up the cohort some of the family be exceptionally large and not what we be use to in this country to deal with that the funding be design specifically so that we could do really pioneer work such as knock through adjoining property to create property big enough for afghan family there be a challenge with large afghan family but they be not the majority of the cohort we can accommodate the majority of the cohort in service family accommodation but where we can not do that i be hop to design scheme that will allow we to use funding in a flexible manner to ensure that these people be accommodate correctly in line with the promise we have make to the people of afghanistan 
 there be still outstanding issue with regard to the processing of afghan case here and i want to use this occasion to make a special plea to the minister i have a constituent who be a former senator in afghanistan the processing of his case be still be delay partly because of some problem about location that we have try to deal with i meet he this week and i think he now have serious mental health problem as a result of the stress he be under i will write again to the minister and i would welcome his personal attention on this case 
 i say to the right hon gentleman and to all hon member who have personal case to email i as i be happy to take they over i have be bring in very recently and i will do what i can to get answer in those case a lot of case be not simple they be not black and white as everybody across the house know i will always be honest about the challenge and we will do everything that we can to look after these people 
 in the interest of impartiality i will quote from the guardian which put the figure of afghans currently strand in uk fund hotel in islamabad at indeed accord to report those hotel have be raid by pakistani authority what assessment do the minister make of that figure and of what have be happen furthermore what discussion have he be have with our high commissioner in pakistan and his opposite number in the pakistani government 
 this be a cross government effort so people from the ministry of defence and the foreign commonwealth and development office be in contact with the high commissioner in pakistan every day we be well aware of this challenge there be separate issue here be the wide pakistani policy towards afghans which be not part of my work in this space and the other be that be apply to those who be entitle to be in the uk and have be pre approve to be in the uk it be the latter that i be concerned about we be determined to get assurance on they and we will keep work until we do i have already make a   commitment that if a single of they be deport back whence they come i will have fail but we will make sure that do not happen 
 i congratulate   the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss   on secure this urgent question particularly as it have give we some clarity today the minister have talk about accommodation what i be hear from my country contact through the all party parliamentary group on afghan woman and girl be that the focus seem to be on family and that only family be be evacuate that mean that single woman many of whom have work in politic and teaching and those from the lgbt+ community be feel particularly vulnerable and they be most at risk of reprisal if they be deport back to afghanistan can the minister clarify what be happen for those single applicant 
 there be no de prioritising of single applicant often they be easy to reintegrate and to accommodate in the united kingdom because they be not a wide family there be lot of story go around the people in this cohort because they be very scared and vulnerable obviously the hon lady be absolutely right to raise this with i but that be not something that i have see none the less i will go back and look for it 
 i chair the all party parliamentary group for hazaras and since the taliban take over hazaras in particular face increase risk of target killing discrimination and persecution what specifically be the uk government do to help the hazaras strand in afghanistan so that they can resettle in a country or indeed in the uk and start a well life 
 i completely recognise my hon friend ’s passion in this space but i have to be discipline about what be in my remit and what be not that be a question for the foreign commonwealth and development office and i know that it be engage on that issue the foreign secretary will have hear his question today if not i will make sure that he have see those remark and that my hon friend get an answer 
 i be assume from what the minister be say that since this egregious change in policy he and his colleague in government be have regular discussion with the government in pakistan during those discussion have he and other seek any assurance that people in pakistan who have live application to come to britain will not be deport back to afghanistan 
 the entire strategic objective that we be try to achieve be to make sure that those who be entitle to be in the uk who have serve with uk force who be part of the acrs pathway and who be part of the cohort that we be talk about be not deport back to afghanistan we be work night and day to get those assurance i be determined that we will get they and that we will look after those people properly 
 i welcome the minister ’s comment and the work that he have do on this topic over the past few year but i be try to   understand the resource that he have available to he it would be helpful if he could update the house on that point may i also ask whether any proportion of the aid budget be likely to be allocate to he for this specific issue 
 at this moment fund on this issue have not be agree certainly when i be do this programme in the summer and clear the hotel the budget and resource be not a constraint we have a bumpy start and the task be challenging but we get there in the end all those hotel be clear and people be put into accommodation the prime minister be committed to that and i know that we will do the same over the next few month 
 i have raise before in this chamber the case of a very talented afghan man who work for the british geological survey which have a base in my constituency he flee to pakistan with his daughter fear for their life but now he have lose all hope he be accept for pitting but do not make it to the airport yet he have be cruelly reject for arap despite have work for a department for international development project he keep the british team safe in afghanistan and i want to know why we can not include he and his daughter in the evacuation before he be hand over to the taliban 
 to be candid with the hon and learn member i be happy for she to write to i about this case but staff and civil servant be deal every day with heartbreaking case of people who fall either side of the line and there be no deliberate decision to exclude anybody we be try as good we can in an incredibly difficult environment to respond to the application and ensure that those who be eligible to be in the united kingdom be here if that individual be eligible for the arap scheme that scheme be still open and he must apply to it i be aware that some in the and community in afghanistan have be reject and they be not entirely sure why we be re engage in that process to ensure that it have integrity and i be happy to look at the hon and learn member ’s case again 
 just people have be resettle in the uk under acrs pathway and eligible applicant who have the support of the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in pakistan be still wait for their paperwork to be process include the mother and brother of a constituent of mine a courageous female journalist who have be grant asylum their life be at demonstrable risk from the taliban and they now face the horror of deportation i have write to the home office repeatedly about this case they meet all the criterion they would have a place to live if they be able to reach here will the minister meet i about this case to see what can be do 
 sure there be different pathway to acrs and clearly some of they be large than other the late immigration statistic show that by the end of june people have be grant settle status under acrs i accept that there be pathway where we could do more in this space but the idea that we have only relocate about people be not chime with the datum that i see every day i want to ensure that   everyone who be entitle to be here be here i will go out and make the case for who be entitle and who be not and we will do everything we can to ensure that those who be eligible be here i be happy for the hon member to write to i about that case and i will look at it personally 
 let i try the minister with this because he say that he want to ensure that no who be entitle to be in the uk be deport my constituent be a british citizen whose child and wife be currently in pakistan threaten with deportation to afghanistan they be invite to the baron hotel an explosion mean that they be unable to get there mr ullah be terrify because he work with the allied force but because he be a uk citizen his family be not eligible under either arap or acr family reunion visa would cost more than £ return to afghanistan mean certain danger he be penalise by his status as of our citizen in the light of his bravery and service to our armed force will the minister use the budget that he say be not a problem to waive those fee and bring mr ullah ’s family here to safety 
 immigration policy in this country be very clear and the immigration policy outside acrs and arap which be what i have be ask specifically to deal with be a matter for the home office as the hon member know i recognise her question i genuinely do but it be a question on immigration policy for the home office i will work night and day to ensure that everyone who be eligible under arap and acrs be return to the united kingdom in line with our promise 
 the minister have say a number of time that the government have seek assurance from the pakistani authority that they will not target those afghans who be eligible to come here have he receive such assurance if not and if he do not what be he go to do about it 
 i can confirm that i have receive verbal assurance from the pakistani authority that those individual be not go to be deport i have to work night and day to ensure that that line be hold and i have make it clear to this house and to the country that we do not want to see any of they deport as i have say to the right hon member and to other i do not want to see that line cross if it be i will return to the house and make a statement on it 
 the hazari family of my constituent a minor bring here under the united nations high commissioner for refugees scheme have have to flee afghanistan and they have be wait and wait for their acrs application to be process when can they expect that to happen and when can they expect to be bring safely to the uk 
 i obviously can not comment on an individual case but if the hon lady write to i today i will personally look at her case and write back to she 
 i be glad that the government be now act on afghans who have be in limbo for a number of   year in pakistan an issue i raise with the minister on   september may i ask about the service family accommodation that he be intend to use for those afghans we know that there be a real crisis in the quality of service family accommodation so can he guarantee that none of the service family accommodation that the ministry of defence be provide will have broken boiler leaky roof or black mould which plague so much sfa that we have put our troop and their family in 
 this government have put £ of extra spending into sfa i recognise the problem with the quality of that sfa which have be a challenge over many year i do not want anybody come back into the uk and live in service family accommodation that be not suitable for they the ministry of defence be bend over backwards as be my right hon friend the minister for armed forces to ensure that this stuff be online and suitable investment be go in but i be determined that individual will live in housing that be suitable for they and i will personally be visit they to make sure that they be 
 i have be try to get a group of interpreter train by the university of leeds from pakistan to here for the last year it would be useful if the minister could let i know who be eligible for the flight and how they will be contact the minister also say that he have visit every hotel in the country i have a hotel in my constituency and i do not remember he inform i that he be come but i would welcome he come to that hotel because everybody now have to be in a share room and the facility be not good 
 i would be interested to learn which hotel that be because i do not want to see people in share room so i will speak to the hon gentleman after this urgent question if he write to i with the specific detail of those interpreter i will assess his case and determine which pathway be good to apply for and their certain eligibility to do so however i be particularly interested in the hotel and if that situation be ongoing today i will sort it out 
 i have be contact by multiple constituent who arrive in the uk via the arap scheme they be extremely worried about their relative the hardship they have experience and the threat of danger with the recent event in pakistan these case range from somebody who work for the british armed force for year a family member who be pregnant and have child and a judge who have previously imprison member of the taliban will the minister agree to look at those case and will he also say whether he have the resource to resolve these matter urgently 
 i will look at every case there be no policy decision to block those who be entitle to be in the uk from be in the uk many of we take this personally and we will see this duty through of course i will look at every case and ensure that a decision be make fairly there be individual in the ministry of defence who be under extreme pressure and work incredibly hard to try to meet this challenge it be very difficult i be more than happy to look at case again but i do not want people to go away think that there be some blanket decision to reject these applicant and not to allow they the protection we promise then that be categorically not the case and i be more than happy to look at individual situation 
 my constituent ’s parent flee afghanistan for pakistan on appeal they be grant adult dependent relative visa to join their family here but before that decision be make their pakistan visa expire and they be force to return to afghanistan due to their be hazaras the fear of travel their disability and medical need and the policy of the pakistan government they can not return to pakistan to collect their paperwork to travel to the uk will the government consider issue some form of digital visa or travel document so that they can fly to the uk and join their family here 
 i be more than happy as i have say to look at individual case we be deal with compete pressure here of uk visa and pakistan visa run out but i can only reiterate what i have say where there be a duty to these people we will see it through and i will work night and day to achieve that endeavour 
 i thank the minister for his answer to our question last time i ask he about a specific family and we send the information through i want to reinforce the point about the force deportation of that gentleman and his family who be also hazaras in his job he assist the british army for to year for month i have be endeavour to get they into the united kingdom because of the risk of harm to they as target attack continue just this morning it have be report that there be an attack on a bus take people from pakistan back into afghanistan it be blow up the danger be clear for i anyway i see it very simply this can not continue for that gentleman his wife and their child we have a job for they a house for they and a future for they we just need the minister ’s help will he help i 
 the hon gentleman have already write to i about a case which i think we have resolve as i say i be more than happy to look at individual case the eligibility criterion in these pathway be clear and official be work hard to ensure that they be as inclusive as they can be but i will always look at personal case and i look forward to receive an email from the hon gentleman 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make a statement on the announcement make by british steel on   november and provide an update on the negotiation between british steel and the government and on the government ’s position on virgin steelmaking in the uk 
 steel be vital to the uk economy i fully recognise the importance of british steel to local community particularly in my hon friend ’s scunthorpe constituency where the company be a major contributor to local economic growth and where she campaign incredibly hard for steelworker 
 global condition have be tough for steel company around the world that be why we have change the competitive landscape for british steel and other energy intensive industry by announce the british industry supercharger a decisive package of measure to reduce the long term electricity price gap that exist between uk energy intensive industry and competitor country that support will mean that strategically significant uk industry such as steel be safeguard against the high industrial electricity price that they have face in too many recent year we have also provide over £ in energy cost relief to the steel sector since in addition to the energy bill relief scheme steel producer will continue to receive support until   march   through the energy bill discount scheme 
 as my hon friend be aware the government make an extremely generous offer of support to british steel early this year to help it to invest in a decarbonised and sustainable future we have continue to work intensively with british steel since then and will continue to do so however she will also understand that the detail of those conversation remain highly commercially confidential and that any public discussion risk undermine talk 
 i know that this must be a deeply concern time for british steel employee and other in scunthorpe follow the company ’s announcement on monday of its plan for future operation i can very much assure my hon friend that we will help affected worker and their family and that we be committed to find solution to enable the ongoing sustainable and decarbonised production of steel just last month for example we announce a £ joint investment package with tata steel to secure a decarbonised future for steelmaking in wales that have the potential to safeguard several job across the uk in the government provide an emergency loan to celsa steel to help it continue trade during the covid pandemic save over job with a further job create since the loan be make 
 i stand absolutely unapologetically with steelmaker and my community today and i do not support these move in this chamber on   september i ask the minister for industry whether she agree that we need to retain a virgin steelmaking capability in the uk for strategic reason alone she say 
 obviously we need a place for virgin steel”—[official report   september vol c. 
 and that that place be scunthorpe that be reiterate the very same day by the secretary of state and so pleased be i with the comment that she make that i take contemporaneous note of that conversation 
 british steel be a private company and can make business decision as it see fit but i be clear that if it be seek hundred of million of pound of public money the government must leverage that money to protect steelworker job and maintain our sovereign capability to make steel in the uk electric arc furnace melt scrap to make virgin steel from scratch we need blast furnace can the minister tell the house how the uk will make virgin steel if all our blast furnace be decommission can she tell we how many country in the g20 be unable to make their own virgin steel would the government be comfortable with we be entirely dependent on foreign import for the virgin steel we will continue to need in this country 
 will any financial support offer to british steel seek guarantee on steel job and lock in as a minimum an interim period of blast furnace production to allow we to explore green option to run they do the government know that this announcement from british steel be imminent when will i get a response to my letter of   september   to the secretary of state why do the department not contact i until pm on monday when i be send simply a short text message what support be the minister offer our excellent north lincolnshire council which be proactively work with british steel to bring additional green job on to the site this government have a good record on steel they have pay worker wage can the minister confirm that steel remain high on the government ’s agenda 
 i have of the world ’s fine steelmaker in my constituency it be my privilege to come out and bat for they today thank you mr speaker for allow this urgent question 
 my hon friend make lot of very credible point there be very little for i to disagree with she do indeed make representation at the high level of government and her priority have always be steelworker she have never play politic with that role i put on record my apology if i have not do due diligence and provide the public service that she should have receive by be contact much soon on that particular day there be nothing she could say that i would not be tell myself off for even more and i hope i will not fall short in communication go forward 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i do indeed say at the dispatch box that my personal opinion be that there be a strong place for virgin steel production in this country and that of course be in her constituency we be in the middle of live negotiation and any decision take by british steel be a commercial decision my hon friend be also right that we be able to carry out due diligence on any support we provide it be taxpayer money and our primary focus be to safeguard the sector and job include in her constituency 
 my hon friend be right to note that we have prioritise the uk steel sector and we will continue to do so we need to provide it with support as it transition because that be also a choice be make by manufacturer customer and consumer who be look for greener steel go forward any decision we take and any support   we provide will be to ensure that the sector be sustainable and competitive we want the sector not just to survive but to thrive 
 my hon friend speak about the support we have provide to the sector to date we have provide hundred of million of pound of support to british steel to deal with its emission and over £ in energy cost relief to the steel sector since we have put the supercharger in place as well as the steel procurement policy note which do its very good to ensure that we procure more steel here in the uk we have provide support to tata to ensure that that part of the country can continue to make steel and to protect those job and we have provide support to celsa my hon friend talk about the support we be provide to north lincolnshire generally there be a huge amount of support there since the government have commit over £ in investment in the north and north east lincolnshire area 
 i can not say much more at this time because we be in the middle of live negotiation that be commercially sensitive when british steel put out its press release that be the time i see it but we must recognise that it be a proposal many thing have to fall into place for such proposal to become accurate plan not only will there be issue around planning but our negotiation have to conclude as well i do not doubt that i will continue to lean on my hon friend and that she will continue to champion steelworker in her constituency and across the country 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank   the hon member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   for secure this urgent question at what will be a very difficult time for her constituent 
 the labour party support the transition to green steel we recognise as the government have now concede that a blend of public and private funding be necessary to do that we believe electric arc furnace be part of the solution but we do not believe they can be the only solution specifically we believe that the retention of primary or virgin steelmaking in the united kingdom be a matter of economic necessity and of national security while we all welcome the return of steelmaking to redcar which should never have be take away to begin with this will clearly mean very significant job loss at scunthorpe i therefore have major concern about this announcement come as it do just after the government have confirm a deal to also close the blast furnace at port talbot 
 the minister say in her answer to her hon friend that talk be ongoing i have to say that that be not my understanding of the current status of this deal could she confirm that please secondly be it true that carbon capture technology could not be pursue at scunthorpe because of delay from the government to the necessary infrastructure over the last year and uncertainty about a future business model in addition be it correct to say that a dri direct reduce iron solution could not go forward because of uncertainty over the government plan for green hydrogen which would obviously be essential for a dri business model thirdly do the government recognise the figure of   job loss and will the minister confirm that this be the net figure cover scunthorpe and redcar in other word that once recruitment at redcar be take into account job loss in scunthorpe will likely be in excess of finally will she confirm how much public money this announcement involve 
 most of all i reiterate to the minister that decarbonisation can not mean deindustrialisation we can not simply outsource our emission to other country call that progress and expect public support for the transition a real plan for green steel must be open to all technology it must be industry wide and it should be a story of new job new opportunity and british economic strength sadly this announcement seem very far from that 
 negotiation be indeed ongoing which be why i be limited in what information i can put out in the public domain information be of course incredibly sensitive british steel will make commercial decision but if it be hop to secure government support we need to make sure that we be get value for money for taxpayer 
 the hon member ask why decision have be take on the electric arc furnace compare with other technology it be because the other technology just can not come up to speed fast enough in particular the hydrogen base direct reduce iron equipment just can not enable furnace to transition at the speed at which they need to he be very much aware of that and this be also a challenge in europe not just in the uk 
 fundamentally there be a number of challenge for the global steel sector there be energy cost which we have do everything we can to provide support for with the hundred of million of pound to cover energy cost and now the supercharger secondly we have to ensure that we get more uk steel into the uk economy that be why the public procurement note be incredibly important for we to do and we will be able to secure million of pound for more uk steel project thirdly there be a major challenge in that advanced manufacturer customer and consumer be look for greener steel and a lot of company be try to reflect on how they can provide a green steel option have say that it be a particular kind of steel as i say to my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft for i that mean a mix of virgin steel in the market as well of course these be commercial decision but we need to make sure there be a mix to deliver for the uk market in particular 
 the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds   talk about the environmental issue and about hydrogen we export a lot of scrap steel and that also have a carbon footprint so for we to have the capacity to turn that steel into product we can use will be incredibly useful the positive news be that we be the large manufacturing country in the world we be go to need more steel not less but there will also be demand for more green steel not less and we be try to ensure that we provide support to the steel sector so that it can meet those market need 
 many of my constituent work at scunthorpe and we be all obviously deeply concerned about they but the whole house must be concern about the minister ’s statement   in term of our national security there be no other major develop country in the world that be give up its traditional blast furnace the only way we can make virgin steel frankly the minister do not bother to answer a single of the brilliant question from my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft will she now make it clear to the house that this government be commit as a major economy to go on make virgin steel do it now 
 as i have say repeatedly at the dispatch box i fundamentally believe we need to have virgin steel capacity in the uk but these be commercial decision and negotiation be continue these be incredibly commercial decision and we be do our very good to support electric and virgin steel capacity in the uk we be very much aware of the challenge we have in import steel and with the global market when it come to the price of steel and that be why we need to make sure we have a mix these be commercial decision which be why negotiation be ongoing fundamentally the announcement by british steel be a proposal nothing be do yet we be still in the middle of negotiation 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 may i begin by express my concern on behalf of the worker who be likely to be affect by this announcement also i re emphasise as other contributor have the importance of virgin steelmaking not just in term of security but in meet demand in the construction industry where inflation be already race ahead and our ability to build thing will not be help by be far away from the supply chain and reduce domestic capacity in steelmaking 
 the energy and climate intelligence unit think tank have say 
 age blast furnace need to be replace and upgrade to produce green steel electric arc furnace have a role in recycle steel 
 but 
 fail to invest in modern hydrogen furnace belie the government ’s promise to invest for the long term 
 just as in the oil and gas sector what plan do the uk government have for a just transition for the steelmaking workforce what support will the uk government be give to the development of hydrogen furnace in the uk what challenge will they put constructively to british steel over these plan give the government ’s high profile retreat on other climate measure such as the date for ban the sale of internal combustion engine car how much faith can the industry have in any guarantee that the government do make 
 negotiation be ongoing and nothing be conclude the statement make by british steel be a proposal not a conclusion the steel that come out of electric arc furnace can be use for a variety of thing include construction and military grade steel it be incredibly nimble but i fully appreciate that different type of steel be produce out of different furnace the hon gentleman speak about hydrogen and the government have a substantial hydrogen strategy that we launch in may the net hydrogen fund be worth up to £ of capital co investment out   to that will support upscaled hydrogen production project allow company include steel producer the potential to secure supply of low cost hydrogen ultimately decarbonisation pathway for specific site be commercial decision for individual company base on their own operational circumstance in the case of port talbot it be about timing for use a technology that can be commercialise at scale at the moment for that part of the country it be electric hydrogen may no doubt be the next stage of technology that be use 
 may i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   for her passionate support for steelmaking in her constituency just yesterday at the dispatch box the prime minister say that even when we get to net we will still need to have oil and gas supply do the same logic not apply to primary steel we will still need that at net do that logic not extend to make sure we have the capability to make primary steel in this country to supply our need in the future 
 i agree on both point on the incredible work that my hon friend the member for scunthorpe do for steelworker in her constituency and secondly that we can not achieve net without a mix of steel be manufacture in the uk we have a booming renewable sector whether that be solar panel blade for offshore wind farm or electric vehicle much of that steel can be produce by electric arc furnace but my right hon friend   the member for tunbridge wells greg clark   be absolutely right that there be a space for virgin steel too 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 i be grateful to   the hon member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   for secure this urgent question the minister be in peril of preside over the end of primary steelmaking in this country and the curtain fall on year of britain ’s industrial history the announcement come at a time when an analysis show that the department ’s budget be set for a real term cut in the year ahead be it the policy of his majesty ’s government that blast furnace will stay in operation in our country and that we will not be dependent on import of primary steel when can we expect a conclusion to the negotiation and some safeguarding of the vital industry either at tata or at british steel 
 i congratulate the new chair of the business and trade committee of which i be previously a member as i have make clear these be commercial negotiation and they be ongoing when the decision be take on port talbot discussion have take place for several year even decade this will not take that long but my point be that many minister have stand at the dispatch box talk about steel and do what can be do to protect and promote the steel sector in the uk the negotiation be ongoing 
 british steel ’s statement on monday contain proposal and a plan nothing be conclude yet my focus as our focus have always be be on protect the steel sector in the uk protect steel job in the uk and do   everything we can to procure more british steel in uk manufacturing of course that continue these be commercial decision about how company wish to continue their business go forward i have make it clear that fundamentally there need to be a mix of steel produce in the uk in the steel market but the reality be this steel produce in electric arc furnace be far more nimble because of the technology and it can be use for many more material in advanced manufacturing than previously that be a fact secondly manufacturer customer and consumer fundamentally want a clean greener steel package it be not just i say that at the dispatch box it be also the uk steel industry representative who have put together a net strategy and be talk about have clean greener steel go forward we have a lot of scrap steel in the uk that can be recycle and we have far more capacity to recycle that than we have for that steel to be use in uk manufacturing but fundamentally we need to have a mix i believe that that mix will continue as long as it can and should but these be commercial decision we continue to negotiate with british steel 
 i have a simple question to put to the minister i hope that i will get a yes or no answer much of the arc furnace capacity be be move away from scunthorpe or not put in scunthorpe because of a lack of grid capacity that electrical grid capacity be due to be increase if she be to accelerate the increase to we may save many more job in scunthorpe will she seek to do that 
 unfortunately there be never a simple answer to these question access to the grid be a challenge for many industry let alone for the steel sector we have be do everything we can to increase access to the grid british steel ’s proposal negotiation will continue say that it have choose site over with its key site at scunthorpe and a site at teesside to be close to its manufacturing work that decision have be make for many other commercial reason beyond access to the grid 
 yorkshire and the humber be of the great centre of steelmaking in our area there be more than job in steelmaking the last time that be count but how many job will be leave when the minister have finish with her cut have she notice that whenever the conservative party be in government it deindustrialise far unite the union i declare an interest as a member be say that if the government would commit to procurement of steel for all our relevant contract further job could be create what exactly do she make of that have she meet representative of the union to discuss that matter 
 i meet representative of the union regularly and i co chair a steel council the steel procurement policy note on increase procurement in the uk be a personal ambition of mine previously we do not calculate enough of the datum on what be be procure and how we could continue to secure more contract procurement have increase with the value of contract up by £ on the previous year i want to go   far that be only the starting point early today i be with the minister for defence procurement   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge and i will continue to work to ensure that there be more uk steel in all our construction whether rail road automotive aviation or anything else the reality be that last year it increase by £ worth of work 
 i fully endorse all the comment of my neighbour my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft many hundred of my constituent work at british steel and i have a british streel terminal on immingham dock in my constituency what assessment have the department and the treasury make of the impact on the local economy if the change go ahead the minister talk about support for worker who may be make redundant i have witness the decline of the fishing industry in the grimsby cleethorpes area which have rip the core out of the community who need generation of support what plan will the government put in place to ensure that that happen 
 of all negotiation be ongoing but i fully appreciate that the statement from british steel will be incredibly unsettling for my hon friend ’s constituent let i explain the way that we work on port talbot we be keen to ensure that any support we provide continue to guarantee job in consultation with local stakeholder and the union we set aside a fund of around £ to ensure that people be reskille and redeploy that work will continue if circumstance require it we be anxious about job these be highly skilled worker recognise internationally and these be well pay job that be why negotiation be sensitive and continue at pace if we provide support we want to get the good deal for uk steelworker 
 the minister will know that shotton steelwork rely on steel from port talbot what assurance can she give on the supply of steel between the closure of the blast furnace and the installation of new electric arc furnace 
 while negotiation be ongoing and support be be provide we have a conversation to ensure that the supply chain continue to be resilient a taskforce have be set up to ensure that supply chain continue to get support work with the union tata and the local community we have be assure that supply chain will continue to secure the contract that have be in place 
 support british steel need not be just about money it can be about ensure that the government be join the dot for industry and explain the pipeline of work available to it with the dreadnought and ssn aukus programme we have generation of need for virgin steel the same go for the new nuclear programme will my hon friend confirm that the government be do that work and signal to british steel that the demand be there also where we have control over procurement be we ensure that we lean towards the british market 
 absolutely that be why procurement go up by £ recently i be look at what the industry group uk steel reflect on when it come to   steel produce by electric arc furnace the reality be that a substantial amount of speciality military grade steel can be manufacture use electric arc furnace we be work very closely with the steel sector to do everything we can to ensure that it secure uk contract 
 the minister seem to be ignore event in south wales last week i meet steelworker from llanwern last week who understandably be deeply worried follow speculation about the closure of the blast furnace at port talbot what condition be attach to the £ grant agree with tata be this the agree plan what be the government actually do to safeguard job 
 we put in place a programme of work and a substantial sum of money around £ to ensure that the transition take place in a just fashion decision will be take by the transition board as have be mention about provide upskille and reskille and ensure that there be assurance in the supply chain the board be make up of the secretary of state for wales the minister for the economy of wales the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities and   the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock who chair the all party parliamentary group for steel and metal relate industry those decision will be take locally and in consultation 
 the government have support a coalmine in west cumbria that will produce coking coal which be use in steel production do the minister agree that it would be sensible for strategic reason which should override commercial reason to retain virgin steel production capacity in this country and that from a practical perspective the coal mine in cumbria could be use in the production of steel in scunthorpe will she take into consideration the wide issue in the policy decision that she may make 
 absolutely i think all of this have make it clear to british steel that there be a supply chain here in the uk not only in the ability to make virgin steel but in the market afterwards but even with electric arc furnace we still need some ability to access coal these be decision take across many whitehall departments my job fundamentally be to ensure that steelmaking in the uk continue at the pace that it have do and grow even far and that we support the manufacturing sector which require british steel 
 the official march of the royal navy include the word 
 heart of oak be our ship 
 in the century virgin steel be the critical industry for the royal navy in the way that timber be in the century i be the to want reduce carbon emission but this move sound more like offshore than about reduce carbon emission what consideration have the government give to the supply of steel to the defence industry 
 of all negotiation continue no decision have be take have say that the uk steel industry group which oversee the steel sector in the uk have make it very clear that military grade speciality steel can be make in electric arc furnace i have be   work incredibly hard to make sure that more uk steel be procure in more uk contract include defence contract 
 i commend my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   for her dog campaign in respect of steel she be a real champion for her constituent this week ’s news be bittersweet as teesside welcome the return of steelmaking will the minister outline what the whole government be do to support my hon friend ’s constituent at this time and what use of carbon capture and storage be be explore to ensure that we continue to produce our own virgin steel 
 i of course agree with my hon friend ’s point there be nobody more vocal about steel than my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft we have have a number of programme in place to support the steel sector because it have a number of challenge as it have in many continental european country fundamentally putin ’s invasion of ukraine cause energy cost to skyrocket and we have in place an energy cost relief scheme for the steel sector which have be worth up to £ since we now have the supercharger in place i have speak about the steel procurement policy note to ensure that there be more uk steel procure in uk market and obviously we provide support for tata recently and celsa previously we be do everything that we can with my hon friend the member for scunthorpe of course to get the good deal possible for scunthorpe but these be commercial decision and they be ongoing 
 it be clear from today ’s comment that the government be set to abandon more than steelworker in scunthorpe just as they abandon over on teesside year ago that say i too welcome the news of a new arc furnace for redcar but let i give the minister yet another chance to answer the question from   the hon member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   and other be the government really go to settle for recycled steel and foreign import and consign virgin steelmaking in the uk to history 
 recycle steel can be recycle infinite time so it do a huge amount for the circular economy because of the way technology have move on steel can now be use in many more sector we have a huge surplus of scrap steel which we end up export to country such as turkey bangladesh and pakistan we could be reuse that in the uk economy but as i say these be commercial decision and nothing have be conclude the statement put out by british steel be a plan or a proposal 
 do the minister not accept that it be a matter of national security that we should retain the ability to create primary steel in this country 
 i have put it on record previously that we need to ensure that we have blast furnace capacity in the uk and that fundamentally should be at the scunthorpe site there be matter involve national security for   instance the anxiety about steel dumping from china and the issue emanate from russia and as we continue to manufacture at pace we need to be able to ensure that we have access to steel manufacture here in the uk 
 some of the mighty structure make of steel be build in my constituency in the nigg yard i work there myself once upon a time   the hon member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   talk about the strategic importance of the industry may i point out to the government that it be as important to my constituency in the far north of scotland as it be to any other part of our great united kingdom 
 i can not disagree with that i have be read up on scunthorpe steel it have be use to create structure range from the sydney harbour bridge to the london eye which demonstrate the breadth and the depth of its history 
 the feedstock for the trostre tinplate work in llanelli be steel of a quality that can currently only be produce in the blast furnace process follow the devastating news that port talbot blast furnace will be close by the end of march leave trostre dependent on import steel quite possibly produce to low environmental standard abroad and certainly not save on emission may i ask the minister to stop just quote commercial decision and tell we what strategy the government have to develop the green technology of the future here in the uk and to keep virgin steel production here as well 
 i have a feeling that i have mention that a few time we have a fund of about £ partly aim to ensure that we be adopt test and commercialise new technology to enable the steel sector to decarbonise we have do a huge amount of work on electricity and we be also consider the possibility of hydrogen so we be look into alternative source of energy to help the sector in the uk i know there be challenge for place such as the hon lady ’s constituency because of the sort of steel that they need but the fact remain that more and more different type of steel can be make to a high standard and a high grade in electric arc furnace 
 the move to net should deliver ten of thousand of long term well pay green industrial job but with her government ’s stick plaster policy the minister be destroy both job and sovereign national capability be it really her intention to leave behind her a british steel sector that can not make british virgin steel and if not what be her plan labour have an industrial strategy for green steel why do she not have as well 
 i simply do not recognise the picture that the hon lady paint our recent decision on tata steel be welcome by uk steel the organisation represent the uk sector which say that it be the way forward uk steel itself have a net strategy and want to see the transition proceed apace 
 decision have be just leave to sit there but now we be able to provide the support that be need what we do in port talbot have save thousand of job and allow the adoption of new technology which will indeed create thousand of job as well 
 last wednesday morning tata steel executive in port talbot summon the workforce to tell they of the plan to shut down our entire virgin steel making capability by march this be utterly shocking because the understanding have always be that some of the heavy end would continue to function while the electric arc furnace be be construct but it take year to construct an electric arc furnace the plan be utter madness it involve import million of tonne of steel from the other side of the world electric arc furnace need the product of virgin steel making such as iron and iron ore that be why we need direct reduce iron capability and the loss of job over a period like that be completely unacceptable and unnecessary 
 when the government do the deal with tata steel about port talbot do they know that tata be actually propose not a transition at all but a potentially lethal cliff edge for our steel industry do they know that tata would be do that do the minister not agree that the idea of this process be that it should be a transition it need to be a bridge not a potentially lethal cliff edge 
 tata steel employ more than people and far in the supply chain all of that would have be at risk if we have not be able to provide the certainty it need to increase its investment to over £ to allow it to transition these be commercial decision relate to the pace of transition the hon gentleman know that there be a transition board in place because he be a member if there have be a failure in consultation at the level and depth of time require there be no doubt that he and i will take that up as we will both be at the next transition board meeting the reality be that to ensure the long term viability of steel in the uk some tricky decision have to be make but the company be provide with support to make sure that it transition in a way that support local job know that it have to transition and support the supply chain 
 i thank the minister for her response we have commit to a net target but consideration must be give to the potential loss of to job which could be go from the industry we have be tell that the furnace closure could put further employment at risk for many what step will be take to ensure that the steel sector and industry job throughout the whole of the united kingdom will be protect i have a meeting this morning where it be confirm to i that the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be no in the world for manufacturing if that be the case steel be a key part of that   the hon member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   be to be congratulate on bring forward this urgent question really minister we need to make sure that the industry can be retain and not reduce at all 
 that be why the support be so substantial to port talbot to ensure that the steel sector could continue to thrive here in the uk manufacturing in the   uk be boom we be the large manufacturer in the world and we need to get our good fundamentally from the uk include steel the hon gentleman be right to say that we can not achieve net without steel but we can help steelmaking to become even more green and clean than it be at the moment 
 do the minister accept that this news give up on the uk ’s capability to produce primary steel 
 i do not because it be a plan or proposal put out by british steel we have not conclude negotiation 
 this be a question of national security it be not just a commercial decision a specific question be ask of the minister by the shadow secretary of state on job loss specifically in scunthorpe be that figure of correct 
 negotiation have not conclude we be continue to be in intensive talk with british steel we wish to provide the support that be need to support the steel sector and steel job but negotiation will continue we need to make sure that due diligence be do and that we get value for money for taxpayer whose money we be go to put on the table but look at what we achieve at port talbot a sector that be unable to confirm its future until we provide it with the financial support that it need 
 with permission mr deputy speaker i would like to update the house on the humanitarian situation in the occupied palestinian territories a tragedy be unfold israel have suffer the bad terrorist attack in its history palestinian civilian in gaza be experience a devastating humanitarian crisis and violence be rise in the west bank the good estimate emerge from a confused situation be that people need access to safe drinking water food supply be run out of hospital have be force to shut down and people be displace i know that the whole house share my pain at see so many innocent life destroy on and since   october 
 britain be work intensively to get more aid into gaza to support the safe return of hostage and british national to back israel ’s right to self defence and to prevent a dangerous regional escalation my right hon friend the prime minister and the foreign secretary have be engage extensively and lord ahmad have be constantly in the region this morning i meet a group of charity and non governmental organisation involve in get life save support into gaza i speak yesterday to the jordanian lebanese and egyptian ambassador and early this morning once again to martin griffiths i wish also to pay tribute to our diplomat and development expert who be strive to make a difference in the most difficult of circumstance 
 despite the many challenge the whole government be determined to do all that we can to continue to stand up for what be right and do the right thing immediately after hamas ’s brutal assault the government bring home almost british national safely on charter and military flight but the safety of all british national be our utmost priority so we be in regular contact with those in gaza register with we since the conflict begin work with partner we have be engage intensively with israel and egypt to allow foreign national to leave gaza via the rafah border crossing this have prove possible on of the last day and i can confirm to the house that as of late last night more than british national have make it through to egypt a forward deploy team of consular official be in el arish close to rafah to meet they and provide the medical consular and administrative support they need we have also set up a reception centre for british national in cairo and have arrange accommodation we will do everything we can to ensure that all remain british national in gaza can leave safely 
 sadly among the british national in gaza some be hold hostage by hamas among the more than innocent cruelly kidnap on   october their plight be a stark reminder of what hamas represent the terrorist continue to launch rocket relentlessly at israeli home and family their stated aim repeat publicly in recent week be the destruction of the israeli state and the eradication of its people that be why the government unequivocally support israel ’s right to defend itself however we have also repeatedly stress that israel must take every precaution to minimise civilian casualty in line with   international humanitarian law we continue to press israel to ensure that its campaign be target against hamas leader militant and military infrastructure we also condemn settler violence israel need to take concrete measure to address it and hold the perpetrator to account 
 all party to a conflict must ensure that their action be proportionate and necessary afford innocent civilian the protection that be their right under international law who can doubt that this be true because the palestinian people be also victim of hamas my right hon friend the prime minister have express his condolence to the president of the palestinian authority mahmoud abbas for the death of palestinian civilian catch in the aftermath of hamas ’s attack 
 since   october the uk have make available £ of additional aid to the occupied palestinian territories more than double our exist aid commitment for this year so far uk flight carry a total of tonne of aid have land in egypt the shipment include life save item such as wound care pack water filter and solar powered light we have also send humanitarian adviser and vital equipment include the forklift truck belt conveyor and light tower specifically request by the egyptian red crescent society to help it to manage and deliver all the international aid receive in egypt more effectively for this aid to meet escalating need however it must enter gaza and do so in much great quantity the government have be work closely with partner include the united nations the international committee of the red cross and the egyptian and israeli government to achieve this 
 since   october a limited number of truck of aid have cross into the strip but the volume go through the rafah checkpoint be nowhere near enough to meet civilian need and it can not be even be it operate at full capacity we be therefore urgently explore with partner measure that can help to increase the flow of humanitarian support these measure must include effective humanitarian pause as agree by all the g7 country in tokyo this morning and we be urge israel to consider utilise the facility at other land border crossing into gaza such as kerem shalom this reflect our current assessment that delivery by land remain the only safe option to deliver aid in the quantity need in gaza while ensure the necessary control and oversight control and oversight matter give the absolute imperative of ensure that aid reach those in need and be not divert or misuse aid diversion be a real risk more so during conflict and i will set out to the house how we be manage those risk 
 all uk aid undergo rigorous oversight no funding go to hamas or the palestinian authority our humanitarian programme in the occupied palestinian territories already operate with enhanced sensitivity with the government have introduce additional safeguard in they include measure to verify and map downstream partner non payment of local taxis and enhance due diligence process we constantly review the due diligence assessment in place with all partner involve in deliver aid in the occupied palestinian territories 
 the whole house recognise however that to prevent further conflict and terrorism and truly alleviate civilian suffering there must be a political solution to the conflict this issue be uniquely polarise we have see across the world and in our own community its potential to radicalise the long stand british position on the middle east process be unchanged we want to see a safe and secure israel live alongside a viable and sovereign palestinian state the urgency of a political track extraordinarily difficult today have never be more clear both israelis and palestinians have a right to live in peace and security 
 we have moral clarity over israel ’s right to self defence and we reject all form of antisemitism but we be also commit to discharge our moral duty to alleviate the suffering of ordinary palestinians and we reject all form of islamophobia the current turmoil must act as a further impulse towards realise a peaceful future for the region and the uk will be do all it can to achieve that i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for the copy of his statement and for his call last night
