 over the past year alone newport cathedral have reclaim over £ under the list place of worship scheme when it soon become necessary to repair the tower at an estimate cost of £   a furth £ in tax will be add to that bill and if that can not be reclaim the project will be delay even far the cathedral provide crucial support to school charity refugee and the homeless do my hon friend recognise the importance of the scheme not only in save significant heritage treasure but in preserve those vital service 
 i absolutely recognise the importance of the scheme and the difference that the cathedral ’s social impact project be make in her community i would be very happy to put my hon friend in touch with the director of property strategy for the church in wales so that they can discuss this issue and i hope lobby together to ensure to say it once again that the scheme be renew 
 the withdrawal of the list place of worship scheme disproportionately affect rural church in my constituency of farnham and bordon list church save nearly £ in the past financial year through the scheme director of st andrew ’s in farnham and of st bartholomew ’s and st christopher ’s in haslemere have raise concern with i this week about the oversubscribed nature of other grant opportunity such as the national lottery heritage fund which combine heritage restoration under the same scheme as for example coastal protection in the humber estuary this dilute the vital church fund need for their heritage can the hon lady inform i how church can be support to preserve heritage in my constituency if the vat relief for repair be not reinstate 
 i thank the hon member for the question as he will have hear throughout this question time we be keen to ensure that the list place of worship grant scheme continue because we can see not only the immense benefit it bring to our community but how it help to alleviate some of the challenge of raise fund it be important that all our heritage building include our church be preserve and that adequate funding be available for they i would be very happy if the hon member wish to meet he to discuss this far 
 the scheme be design to address a perverse incentive in the vat rule that favour demolition and rebuild at a time when we be unable to change those rule post brexit we can now do so will the church commissioners draw that to the attention of those on the treasury bench 
 yes 
 will the hon lady therefore support my private member ’s bill which be come up in march and be design specifically to exclude repair to list place of worship from the vat regime 
 i will have a look at the hon member ’s bill 
 i too want to refer to the land of calvin oatcake and sulphur scotland in a village in my constituency where i use to live there be a lovely old church of scotland church that have be buy by a   former member of this place it be in bad condition and it be upset local people can good practice be share north of the border with planning authority and heritage organisation i would be most grateful

 what step the church have take to respond to the recommendation set out in the makin review publish on october 
 what recent step the church have take to respond to allegation of child sexual abuse within the church of england 
 what step the church have take to respond to the recommendation set out in the makin review publish on october 
 the makin report make clear the devastating abuse suffer by child and young people at the hand of john smyth in the meeting i have with representative from the archbishops council i raise the need for the makin review to be a defining and watershed moment for the church the review make recommendation some of which have already be implement i be await a full and thorough update from the church on the detailed progress be make on each recommendation that work be in addition to the ongoing effort to respond to the wilkinson and alexis jay inquiry into child sexual abuse follow these report the church begin develop potential new safeguarding model which will be decide at the general synod in february 
 i pay tribute to my ecclesiastical co worker the right reverend helen ann hartley bishop of newcastle for her leadership and courage in champion the voice of victim in the wake of the makin review newcastle be proud of she be the church commissioners aware of her ongoing concern about the implementation of the review in particular what can they do to ensure that diocese have the resource necessary to implement a high standard of safeguarding and to ensure that the church be focus on the interest of the victim and the vulnerable rather than the career interest of lead clergy 
 my hon friend rightly raise the work that her own bishop have be do in her constituency on this issue follow the makin review colleague such as my hon friend and many represent here today and from across the house have rightly be raise their concern about safeguarding in the church this week i meet representative from the archbishops council include the bishop of stepney joanne grenfell   who be the lead bishop for safeguard in the church to raise my concern the house can rest assure that i do that robustly 
 the church ’s national safeguarding team be now at stage of its stage process to assess and deal with the risk pose by those criticise in the makin review which be rightly welcome in addition the church institution have develop the model proposal on safeguarding which will go to the synod in february those independent safeguarding model will look at a scrutiny body and at safeguard operation more independent of the church i will be at the synod in february and i will listen closely to that debate make no mistake the church have an enormous amount of work to do to create a cultural shift that be what be require it need to rebuild trust and confidence it be also important that everybody in the house feel as though they get the opportunity to raise their concern i thank my hon friend and other for ensure that they have raise this issue here today 
 i would very much like to pay tribute to the bishop of newcastle as well what be so tragic be that so few senior voice be be hear in the anglican church the makin review name the bishop of lincoln and the bishop in charge of the episcopal church but so few people have be hold to account will the hon lady please ensure that more people be properly hold to account and that some of the people who have be name be clear out of those top job 
 the right hon member make a critical point it be so important for the church to view this as the chance to turn a corner and make it a watershed moment we need change and those responsible must be hold to account i would be happy to discuss this matter far with the right hon member if that would be of help but he should make no mistake that i strongly believe that it be important that the church   be hold to account the bishop of stepney the lead bishop for safeguarding and the director for safeguard both welcome the makin review when it be publish last year we must ensure that its recommendation be implement 
 the urgent need for independent scrutiny of the church ’s safeguard procedure be highlight both by the makin report and by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse what be the current arrangement for independent scrutiny of safeguarding follow the dismissal of the church ’s independent safeguarding board what be the timescale for have a permanent system for independent scrutiny in place   to safeguard against such appalling act of abuse as highlight in both those report 
 independent scrutiny of the church ’s safeguard work be extremely important the church commission a series of audits on diocese and cathedral by independent safeguard expert and several have be complete and publish the independently chair national safeguarding panel which include victim and survivor among its member currently scrutinise safeguarding but as i have already point out proposal to strengthen scrutiny in the church will be vote on at the synod next month and   the church will then have to create a plan for implementation once the right model have be approve at that general synod in february 
 what step the church be take to improve the maintenance of the hyde park estate 
 the hyde park estate have be manage by the church commissioners for over year and they be commit to its long term stewardship as responsible landlord the commissioner be commit to adopt good practice and have continuous investment programme for the management of building on the estate to ensure that they remain fit for purpose both now and in the future 
 i have be work for month with resident of the quadrangle the water gardens and connaught village on the scale of their service charge they have manage to reduce their service charge by will my hon friend join i in congratulate they on their hard work and agree that they should not have have to work that hard will she join i in a meeting with the church commissioners to improve the transparency and monitoring of service charge   level 
 of course i congratulate the resident on their hard work i know from my constituency about the challenge around increase in service charge it be so important that they be transparent to everybody i would be happy to join my hon friend in a meeting with her resident on this issue and i would recommend include those from the church commissioners property service team i hope that will be okay 
 the hyde park estate be an oasis of peace and tranquillity in the middle of the concrete and building and use daily by many what step will the church take to ensure that there be sufficient waste disposal and recycle bin across the hyde park estate for those with leg and indeed for those with leg 
 i be sure that those manage and maintain the estate be look at all those issue but i would be happy to write to the hon gentleman with further information 
 the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam represent the speaker ’s committee on the electoral commission be ask 
 if the commission will make an assessment of the potential merit of ban foreign donation to uk political party 
 what recent assessment the commission have make of the adequacy of the rule on donation by non uk citizen to political party 
 when establish the political finance regime parliament ’s explicit intention be to ban foreign donation however limitation of the current law mean that it be possible for money from foreign source to enter the uk electoral system through donation from uk company for that reason the electoral commission have call for the law around company donation to be strengthen to ensure that party can not accept money from company that have not make enough in the uk to fund their donation or loan to impose a duty to carry out enhance know your donor check and to improve transparency over donation make through unincorporated association 
 in recent week we have see the unedifye spectacle of opposition party try to curry favour with particular foreign billionaire however this issue be much big than elon musk transparency international uk estimate that £ in every £ in our system—£150 since come from questionable or unknown source when will these proposal come forward so that we can debate they in the house and tackle this threat to our democracy 
 as the hon member will understand proposal to change the law must come from the government with whom i gently suggest he have more influence that i do but he be right that transparency be crucial it be important that we understand the source of the donation so that the political party that accept they can be properly hold to account 
 surely even in these febrile time it should not be difficult to build a consensus around the proposition that foreign money should not be in british politic can we not get the party together now to make the strong possible package of reform rather than react when it be too late 
 as i mention there be a consensus in this house that foreign donation should not play a part in british politic but there be gap in the law as   i mention the electoral commission believe that those gap can be properly close through further legislation it be speak to the government about that and i know that it would be happy discuss the matter far with the right hon gentleman if he so wish 
 the hon member for battersea represent the church commissioners be ask 
 what step the church be take to tackle racial injustice 
 in the house of bishops create the archbishop anti racism taskforce follow by the archbishop commission for racial justice to continue the work of tackle racial injustice in the church and society last february the general synod vote unanimously to continue effort to address racial injustice across the church 
 the church ’s work to recognise the importance of diversity and on proactive anti racism be very welcome but what step be it take to address its historical link to the slave trade 
 the church ’s role in slavery be truly shameful it be only right that it take action to recognise its link to the transatlantic enslavement of africans no amount of money would ever be enough to repair the horror of the slave trade but the church commissioners project will set aside £ over year for a programme of impact investment research and engagement it be hop that this fund will continue to grow over time and will reinvest return investment in grant funding will be direct towards community that have be impact by the enslavement of africans 
 will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business

 for the convenience of the house and in view of the important statement that be take place today the motion on the draft deposit scheme for drinks containers england and northern ireland regulations will not be move today 
 i be sure that the leader of the house and every member will join i in welcome the news overnight of a ceasefire in gaza let we hope and pray that it be as effective comprehensive and long lasting as possible 
 back at home all can say be that it have be another extraordinary week for the government though possibly not in the way that they would have want we have have the government ’s anti corruption minister herself be name for corruption by another country in the face of an international investigation into embezzlement of development and other fund we have have the unusually unlovely sight of the chancellor of the exchequer in a desperate search for growth that have take she to beijing and back though with precious little result it seem the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales say this week that stagflation that toxic combination of recession and inflation be now a live risk even the very very modest gdp growth report for november be below expectation 
 at some point the government ’s current spending splurge will doubtless start to nudge growth upwards over the come year but in the meantime we will have to look forward to the grim prospect of the national insurance change in april and the horror of the employment rights bill which even by the government ’s own estimate will cost employer an extra £ a year so dire have the chancellor ’s position become that she have be force to ask cabinet colleague for idea of growth give the galaxy of business talent around the cabinet table how can that possibly go wrong 
 meanwhile the prime minister have be force not only to express full confidence in the chancellor always a death knell but to insist that she will remain in post for the full period of this government let we see how that work out it have be extraordinary in particular to see she attack by her own colleague who have say 
 we ’re go back to austerity in all but name 
 luckily the government be able to announce some good news in the form of the late result of the national wealth fund which have apparently generate more than job and £ in private investment over the last month except that the announcement be i be afraid entirely disingenuous as lord livermore say in a debate in the other house in october the national wealth fund be in fact the uk infrastructure bank with a new name and a bit more capital i know something about the uk infrastructure bank because i set it up in when i be financial secretary to the treasury it have an absolutely world class leadership team and i be not remotely surprised to see it do so well but the idea that its recent success be attributable to a labour government who have do little more than rebrand it be an embarrassing joke its success have be power by good institutional design a top team tonne of talented employee and more than year of hard work 
 recall the government ’s attempt to claim credit for £ of international cash in the october investment summit i know the leader of the house be a strong believer in transparency and accountability so will she have the treasury update the house on what form that investment have take how much of it have be receive and where it be be spend frankly it be more than doubtful that month of post election chaos in the government have any such effect in boost investment but we will see when the government publish the number as i be sure they will if it turn out like the so call national wealth fund we will know that the labour government be more than happy to take credit for at least some of the work of the previous government provide that they can put their own name on it 
 i too be sure that the whole house will welcome the development between israel and gaza over the past hour and day with a long overdue ceasefire and the release of hostage now look like a real possibility although that be still to be confirm this will hopefully now lead to much need aid get in usb the end of the killing the hostage be release and i hope what will be the beginning of a long term political solution for the region we will hear shortly from the foreign secretary with further detail on that 
 i will explain of the piece of business i have just announce and set out why the government will table a money resolution relate to the terminally ill adult end of life bill next week in order for a bill committee to consider any clause that could have spending implication the government must table a money resolution that be not the government agree to fund the measure in a bill it be purely to enable the bill to be debate in committee in the case of this bill this relate to small component that be yet to be debate and agree without the motion be agree to that debate could not happen and that component could not remain in the bill the government have take the view that that would act against our commitment to remain neutral on the bill the house should debate and decide on these matter for itself i hope that as with reading colleague will focus on the substance and not the process of this sensitive private member ’s bill 
 it really have be quite incredible to watch the collective display of amnesia on the conservative benches over recent week it be like the past year do not happen i see that the leader of the opposition be out today in what have be brief as she finally tell the truth about the conservatives record they do not have a plan for growth they be not honest with the british people and they negotiate a bad brexit deal however it sound like   the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman   do not quite get that memo 
 it sound like the right hon gentleman do not get the memo about the conservative need to be honest about their record on standard either if he want to compare the previous government ’s record on lose ministers i be quite happy to do so boris johnson have of his own ministers resign in hour the high number on modern record even the very nice right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak lose of his senior ministers in his few month include his party chairman and deputy prime minister for break the ministerial code even when there be investigation on ministers they be often ignore this government have strengthen the ministerial code and now have an adviser who be able to initiate investigation we have bring in new rule for member of parliament on outside interest and we will go far 
 the right hon gentleman obviously do not get the memo on the conservatives record on the economy and be instead try to attack our plan the leader of the opposition his party leader be now tell the country that they do not have a plan for growth that be the truth of the situation be n’t it the conservatives have year to do something about the fundamental weakness in our economy and they do nothing in fact they make those weakness even worse stagnant growth low productivity low wage low skill high mortgage high debt poor health poor housing woeful transport deep seat inequality and no ambition under the previous government to gain the job of the future we be begin to tackle those deep root weakness and that be the truth that he and his party leader should be tell the country 
 community organisation be the backbone of many event in town and village across north west    leicestershire for the past year the rotary club of ashby de la zouch castle have organise our annual charity santa fun run in ashby which i have have the pleasure of take part in alongside hundred of local people last week the club present cheque to loros hospice rainbow hospice for child and young people and staunton harold sailability trust it be great to hear that the fun run have now raise over £ for local charity that support resident in need will the leader of the house join i in thank the volunteer for their commitment to support our community and could the house be grant an opportunity to discuss what further support could be provide to volunteer to ensure that they continue to thrive 
 i will certainly join my hon friend in thank the volunteer in her constituency for what sound like fantastic local fundraising activity i think she be go to ask i to go on a fun run to which the answer be go to be no but otherwise i welcome her question 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 on the liberal democrat benches we have be delight by the recent groundswell of support from across the house for liberal democrat policy in particular i cite the support for our youth mobility scheme eu countries bill the warm response for the sunshine bill the new homes solar generation bill from my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson which be come tomorrow and the house endorse a fairer voting system will the government answer this clear yearning by member across the house for liberal democrat policy and provide parliamentary time to ensure those bill become law 
 i notice that this week there be further public support for the liberal democrats i understand that of respondent to a review of their general election campaign think their party leader ’s eye catch campaign style be very effective i concur so here ’s to even more bungee jumping and paddle boarding but perhaps less of the tight wetsuit i’m not sure i really want to see those i be pleased that we be able to support a number of the measure come forward from the hon lady ’s colleague i look forward to continue to work constructively across the house with liberal democrats 
 as the junction parliamentary champion i report that resident across bolsover be really frustrate by congestion can we have a government statement on what we be do to tackle congestion across bolsover 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the issue of congestion in bolsover and i congratulate she on do so today she will know that this be of a number of issue the government be seek to tackle through their transport and road strategy 
 will the leader of the house please ask the secretary of state for transport to come urgently to the house and give a statement on the destruction of tree and vegetation along the liberty line which run from romford to emerson park in my constituency there have be an   extreme lack of accountability and communication from network rail it have not consult local resident or elect representative despite promise to do so in when a similar incident occur this be devastating for the local environment and wildlife cut down healthy tree be wrong and network rail need to be hold to account for its action 
 i be sure that many colleague across the house recognise that the felling of healthy tree cause a great deal of local interest from constituent wherever it occur so the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise it i be not aware of the particular case he raise but i will ensure he get a ministerial response 
 gary a constituent of mine who live in thrapston have his drive licence suspend for month due to a medical condition during that time his employer support he get to and from work but shortly before his licence be due to be renew it be once again due to his medical condition suspend for a further month in the light of that and in order to continue to work gary apply for support from the access to work grant scheme follow his application gary be advise that there be a week wait before his application would be deal with do the minister agree that the government have prioritise support people who wish to continue to work whenever they can and that delay in grant application like this be totally unacceptable and could lead to people lose their job can we get gary ’s case look into as soon as possible 
 it be completely unacceptable for people to have to wait as long as that this government be commit to significantly reduce the waiting time for access to work and other programme and i will ensure that a minister look into gary ’s case and it be resolve as soon as possible 
 i call the chair of the backbench business committee 
 i thank the leader of the house for allow protect time for this afternoon ’s backbench business debate and also for allow time next week for the annual holocaust memorial day debate in addition to the business that she announce for monday there will be select committee statement on behalf of the treasury committee and another on behalf of the defence committee those committee statement be important so i trust that the government will try not to schedule too many government statement that would squeeze the time available we always like to satisfy colleague and on   thursday january   there will be a debate on proportional representation for general election 
 in westminster hall next tuesday there will be a debate on the provision of auditory verbal therapy next thursday there will be a debate on the united nations international day of education follow by a debate on innovation in the field of rare retinal disease on   tuesday january   there will be a debate on road safety for young driver and on   thursday january   there will be a debate on medicinal cannabis 
 in addition may i point out that the palestine solidarity campaign have organise hate march across london over many month since   october the metropolitan police have finally decide that it be unacceptable for the campaigner to form up at midday yard from a synagogue where jewish people be threaten when leave or join the shabbat service and have insist that the route of the march must not go near any synagogue however the campaigner have say that they will defy the police and form up outside the synagogue again may we have a statement from the home secretary reinforce the view that if that happen those individual should face the full force of the law and the cost of police the demonstration to ensure that public order be protect 
 let i thank the hon gentleman for list a number of future debate i be pleased that after he have raise the matter with i in during business question last week i be able to protect time for this afternoon ’s debate and that we be able to find government time for a proper debate on holocaust memorial day next week as ever i thank he for his continue work as a very diligent and good chair of the backbench business committee 
 as for the other issue the hon gentleman will know that decision about the policing of protest and demonstration be a matter for the police they be operational matter but he be right to say that public safety should be at the fore along with ensure that no be subject to antisemitism or any other kind of hate as a result of any demonstration 
 may i pick up some comment that be make a little early many of my constituent have write to i express their concern about campaign finance law follow medium report that a certain foreign billionaire will be provide very large donation will the government introduce legislation to cap individual donation close exist loophole and enhance the power of the electoral commission 
 my hon friend be right foreign money and foreign donation have no place in uk politic and be prohibit under current law but the exist legislation may need to be tighten as he will know we have a manifesto commitment to look at donation to political party and we will be introduce a bill on election probably in the next session 
 yesterday along with many other member i attend an oversubscribed debate in westminster hall lead by   the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes   on compensation for waspi woman it be clear there be no consensus on the government side in relation to the outcome of the government ’s decision give that the parliamentary and health service ombudsman send the report to parliament for parliament to decide when will the government provide time for a debate and a vote 
 i thank the hon member for that question as she say a debate do take place yesterday and there be many mechanism for debate to be bring forward in the chamber or westminster hall i know it be of great disappointment to people that the government have take this decision which be quite a specific   about that report many woman be communicate with over that time and an apology be issue but we do not feel that the compensation be propose be proportionate or would be a fair use of public fund at this time 
 we have a housing crisis across the uk and i be pleased that the government have announce a plan to build more home do the leader of the house agree that council have an important part to play in fix this crisis by update their local plan and deliver the home that be so desperately need include social housing and affordable home without these plan our green belt space be at risk such as whyburn farm in my constituency which ashfield independents on the district council be fail to protect by have no plan do she agree that it be vital that council use their local plan to meet the need of community while also protect our green belt space 
 my hon friend be absolutely right this country face a housing crisis that be why this government have an incredibly ambitious target to build home over the course of this parliament and we be change the national planning policy framework to ensure that local council have ambitious target for their own local area in order to meet that target 
 in the new year ’s honours list stuart hogg be award an mbe since then he have be charge convict and sentence for domestic abuse do the leader of the house and lord president of the council agree that he should be strip of that state honour 
 i thank the hon member for raise this important matter which i know be of great concern to he and to many other member across the house let we be clear that domestic abuse be abhorrent we condemn it and it should not be or be see to be reward by any of we it be completely understandable and appropriate that he and other raise question about whether this honour should continue he will know that i can not comment on individual honour however recommendation to remove honour be consider by the forfeiture committee which he might want to raise this with 
 i be deeply concerned about a local decision by our hospital trust to cut the bus route between burnley general teaching hospital urgent care centre and royal blackburn teaching hospital which be a huge loss to staff and patient will the leader of the house join i in call on transport operator the county council east lancashire hospital nhs trust blackburn with darwen borough council and other to get round the table and find a solution to save our shuttle bus and keep this vital service run 
 shuttle bus such as the my hon friend describe in his constituency especially those that go to hospital and other local service be vital for too long local area and community have not have a say in the bus route they need in their area that be why we have bring forward the bus services bill   which be make its way through the other house and will ensure that his constituent have more of a say over the bus route in their area 
 as i be sure you know mr speaker my constituency be the source of a number of globally significant chalk stream not least and most famously the river test a number of members be press the previous government to bring forward a chalk stream recovery pack to help get those river back to their good state of health so you can imagine our disappointment when we learn in the medium before christmas that this pack be be abandon as be subsequently confirm in a ministerial statement could we have a statement urgently from the secretary of state about what he will do to replace that pack and bring these river back to the state of health they should be in 
 we have to help sir charles walker ’s fishing come on leader of the house 
 i pride myself on know lot of thing about what the government be do but i have to admit that this be not something i be aware of or can offer the right hon gentleman any particular advice on right now however i assure he that i will raise it today with the minister and ensure that he get a full response if that be not sufficient i will ensure that the minister come to the house 
 back in september i hand deliver a letter to the home office regard critical concern about our asylum hotel and about so many vulnerable family be put in such a deprived area i have a hold response in october as do my council but can the leader of the house secure i a meeting with home office official to discuss this vital issue 
 my hon friend consistently raise the issue of asylum hotel in his constituency and i be really sorry to hear that he have not yet have a response from the relevant minister i will ensure that he get a response and the meeting he have ask for 
 my question be about a rather disturbing matter and it regard the late issue of the house magazine on page there be an article entitle state of the union there be depiction of the united kingdom and each country have its flag the flag over northern ireland contrary to what the rest of the world know it to be be the flag of the republic of ireland as oppose to the union flag or the ulster banner this be absolutely outrageous and must be correct in a suitably clear manner 
 the flag of our nation my nation be precious when i look at the red of the st patrick ’s cross in the background of that flag i think of the blood of those whose life be give in the defence of northern ireland and this great nation when i see the publication ’s mistake it grieve i to see how we be regard by so many i wish to make it clear that we do not live under the flag of the republic of ireland despite the view of those who do not take their seat here however it seem that their influence be great than that of those in this   chamber the flag of northern ireland be the ulster banner or the union flag and it mean something to many people 
 we can not allow this disgraceful incident to pass i ask the leader of the house and you mr speaker to ensure that there be a correction perhaps the staff at the house also need to be educate about the basic of the state of the union include its geography they need to understand the wee simple thing give that it purport to be a political magazine that be focus on the business of this house will the leader of the house show her displeasure with the erroneous depiction may i ask she to ensure that a correction be make immediately and that geographic training for staff at the house magazine will take place 
 i absolutely share the hon gentleman ’s displeasure and i thank he for raise this matter today it be a very disturbing mistake for the house to have make he will be aware that i be not responsible for the magazine but i hope that the editor and the editorial board be watch this exchange and can offer the hon gentleman a full explanation and a full apology they need to put this situation right with immediate effect 
 give that i have be bring into this matter i reassure the hon gentleman that the house be not a publication of the house but it do trade on the house ’s name and use the house ’s coat of arm there be question to be ask and the hon gentleman have raise a very important question the leader of the house and i will look at what we can do and what should happen next 
 right across my constituency there be plenty of support for this government ’s ambition to do far well when it come to transition to clean green renewable energy however there be also a lot of frustration when my constituent see new house go up because we be not make use of rooftop and make sure that home have the high energy efficiency standard can we have a statement from the housing minister about how we can make sure that we be far more ambitious than the last government in the requirement on developer 
 my hon friend raise a really important point solar panel on new home will be a vital component in meet our clean energy superpower ambition he will be aware that the previous government actually pull back from include solar panel in the new building regulation have they do so we would already have a much high level of solar energy come into the grid we be already put that right 
 post office provide vital service in our rural community such as banking in my thornbury and yate constituency however there be concern about the future of the post office in tytherington community shop follow the announcement that its partner post office in cromhall will close at the end of february will the leader of the house agree to give we a debate in government time on how we can support community post office in the future 
 the issue of community post office regularly come up in these session and i know it be a matter of considerable importance to the house it would make for a good backbench business debate and i see that the chair of the backbench business committee be still in his place   the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young   be right to raise these issue i know that colleague be concern about plan to close all the current crown post office too she should know that no decision have be make on that and i would encourage colleague to raise the matter very strongly in the house with ministers and indeed with the post office itself
