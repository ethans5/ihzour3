 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for transport on the cost of hs2 
 the chancellor launch the efficiency and saving review in the autumn statement to focus on the government ’s priority and identify way in which to work more efficiently and help to manage budgetary pressure from high inflation the secretary of state for transport and i discuss the cost of hs2 during the review which help to inform the decision to rephase certain part of the project as part of balance the nation ’s book 
 the travel between north and south be the bit of transport infrastructure that work it be the travel across the north that do not work what would the cost of hs2 have to reach for the government to conclude that it no long represent value for money for the taxpayer or be the government pursue the essentially socialist policy that they will keep pay for this ridiculous white elephant irrespective of the final bill 
 i take the precaution of research my hon friend ’s interest in this subject and i note that he be issue challenge on it year ago the government remain as they be then fully commit to deliver hs2 and the integrated rail plan this be a long term investment that will bring our big city close to each other it will boost productivity and will provide a low carbon alternative to car and plane for many decade to come as my hon friend know we be also work through the irp on a £ package to improve inter regional rail connection which obviously affect his constituent 
 do the minister agree that this country ’s performance on productivity have be pitiful over the last year there have be virtually no improvement in productivity and reason for that be our lack of investment in national infrastructure slow down hs2 be a bad move when it come to improve our infrastructure and it be year since we agree to a runway at heathrow do the minister agree that if we be to improve our productivity we have to invest in infrastructure 
 i can agree with the hon gentleman that the investment of £ in infrastructure in all part of the country to which the government be committed be critical to ease the productivity challenge that have face successive government and the chancellor will introduce measure in the autumn statement to address it far 
 hs2 ’s cost have balloon since it be conceive under the last labour government as my right hon friend have say owe to pressure from the treasury the project have have to be rephase and train will now go from west london not central london to a station not in central birmingham which negate the benefit that the scheme ’s proponent say it would bring with cost balloon still far we just can not afford it can we 
 i be sorry but i do not agree with my hon friend i certainly recognise that infrastructure investment of this scale and with this level of ambition be never easy to deliver i have set out the change to the profile of the investment but all the key element be still on track and we will continue to work with the department for transport to ensure that that remain the case 
 be the minister not also concerned about cost benefit analysis have not assumption behind the pattern of business travel demand be change dramatically by the pandemic work from home and video conferencing be the minister satisfied that the department for transport have properly re evaluated hs2 to take account of such change 
 yes i be content with that i recognise those change in pattern of behaviour when it come to the use of public transport but we also face cost of living challenge that be why we be work so closely with the department for transport to for example continue investment in bus over the next year and continue to spend £ on cap fare to £ outside london we must bear in mind however that continue investment in transport infrastructure be key to great connectivity across the united kingdom and deal with the economic growth imperative 
 it have be report over the last couple of day that accommodate hs2 will mean few train between the north and london station affect be wilmslow in my constituency do the minister agree that be that to happen hs2 would no long be value for money or good for the north it would certainly take long and cost my constituent more 
 hs2 be go to happen the question be what additional investment across other part of the rail infrastructure might benefit my right hon friend ’s constituent additionally and more directly i set out with the integrated rail plan the £ package to improve rail connection and many element of that will have a direct impact on her constituent in cheshire 
 as the minister be well aware north west leicestershire have suffer under the blight of hs2 for more than a   decade and the whole project have recently be declare to be undeliverable it have be unaffordable for some considerable time will he urge his colleague in government to cancel the remainder of the eastern leg and reallocate just a small portion of that budget so that we can reopen the ivanhoe line 
 i recognise that the hon gentleman have strong view on this and i know that he have be personally affect by it in the past the project although it have be rephase will continue there be a number of issue involve in ensure tight management of that budget and i be work closely with the department for transport to see that that happen 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of climate change on the economy 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of climate change on the economy 
 the treasury ’s net review note that unmitigated climate change damage have be estimate to be the equivalent of lose between and of global gdp each year the cost of global inaction significantly outweigh the cost of action and mckinsey estimate that there be a global market opportunity for british business worth £ 
 a recent report from carbon tracker find a huge disconnect between what scientist expect from climate change and what our financial system be prepare for with flawed economic modelling lead pension fund and other to seriously underestimate the risk meanwhile energy uk warn that we be lag behind on green energy investment surely the minister agree that to revive our economy and avert climate catastrophe we must rapidly phase out fossil fuel and invest in a green new deal to reach net 
 it be important to point out that we be the fast decarbonising economy in the g7 since we have decarbonise by while grow our economy by but the hon lady be right this will take a balanced approach involve both public spending and private investment include pension fund investment the recent pension fund reform for example should unlock some new asset for green infrastructure 
 i agree with the question about the carbon tracker report it have find that policy decision be be base on 1990s literature that be year old will the chancellor review the datum and the thinking that the government be use to make sure that   all strand be in line with the climate science of the   century 
 the datum that i look at show that last year of our electricity be generate from renewable that be an amazing achievement but we be alive and present when it come to decarbonise our economy we have great plan and we be build on our great track record we will continue to do that 
 i now welcome our new member steve tuckwell 
 thank you mr speaker do my hon friend agree with my uxbridge and south ruislip constituent   that mayor khan ’s ultra low emission zone expansion hit family and business without any significant environmental benefit 
 let i welcome my hon friend to his place he have waste no time whatsoever in advocate for his constituent against a labour tax that be hit household and business in his constituency and throughout the south east it be a massive tax bombshell at a time when family just do not need it it be simply not right and we would urge the leader of the opposition to tell his mayor of london to stop it 
 the shadow chancellor have say that she will not rule out mandate the use of pension fund money for the pet scheme that the labour party think will achieve net put at risk the saving of many pensioner in this country what do my hon friend think the impact of that will be on the british economy 
 pension fund have a fiduciary responsibility to deliver a financial return but also to be mindful of the value of their pensioner i have every confidence that pension fund will continue to invest in line with the risk that be present by climate 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this tory government effectively ban new onshore wind which be vital for net energy security and get bill down we now learn this could change because fine group of tory rebel be shout louder than another group of tory rebel there be no leadership just a government lead by their back benchers can we finally get an answer from the government on whether they will dither and delay or join labour in lead the way and act on onshore wind 
 onshore wind have an important part to play and we be already deploy gw of energy from onshore wind the cost of onshore wind have come down significantly it be of our cheap energy source the hon lady do not have long to wait for the energy bill which we be consider later today 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the growth plan of september on mortgage interest rate 
 over the course of high inflation from putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine see interest rate increase across most western economy the path to low rate be through low inflation which be why the prime minister make halve inflation of our priority for this year i be pleased that the late bank of england forecast show that we be on track 
 mortgage and associate rental cost be soar in putney roehampton and southfields and the government like to claim it be all due to global shock or the war in ukraine but the late bank of england datum from july show that the cost of lend to buy a home remain high in the uk than in germany italy or france will the minister finally concede that this difference be because those country do not have the devastating growth plan or mini budget last year and that it be because of this government ’s wide economic failure that my constituent face these cost 
 i be glad that the hon lady ’s constituent among many other will benefit both from our mortgage interest support and from there be almost double the number of mortgage product on the market now than in october i repeat the comment of my colleague the exchequer secretary to the treasury if the hon lady be so worried about her constituent what well way of help they with the cost of live than to do away with the mayor ’s ulez tax 
 in the uk homebuyer be overwhelmingly dependent on short term fix rate mortgage of just or year which mean that in time of rise interest rate as we have at the moment they be hard hit by massively increase mortgage bill in most other country homebuyer have long term fix rate mortgage of or year or of the entire length of the mortgage do my hon friend agree that the regulator should ensure a level playing field between short term and long term mortgage to give homebuyer a free choice of the sort of mortgage they want so they can choose to have great protection against rate rise if they want 
 my hon friend have great knowledge of these matter it be a privilege to work with he and the sector on how we can offer consumer and homebuyer more choice that choice include the opportunity of long term fix rate mortgage and my official and i continue to work on how we can reduce friction and barrier to those mortgage 
 i welcome darren jones the new shadow minister 
 it be estimate that household will face a rise in their mortgage bill this month if someone in a random constituency say mid bedfordshire be to remortgage their house in the next month they could pay an average of £ more per month compare with before the disastrous tory mini budget this time last year what can the chancellor and his team do to reassure the country that if the conservatives be to win the next election they would not just mess up the economy all over again 
 i be sure the constituent of mid bedfordshire will be very pleased to know that more than of mortgage provider have sign up to our mortgage charter which offer the opportunity for relief to term out mortgage and to have interest free period if they face adversity at this time when interest rate be   high across the world what will not help the constituent of mid bedfordshire be unfunded spending promise that we know will push up the cost of borrowing and defer the point at which inflation fall 
 that be a bit rich from the government and it be no answer whatsoever to the people of mid bedfordshire who will not be able to afford to pay their bill over the come month it be year ago today that the former tory prime minister take a huge ideological gamble and sabotage britain ’s economy they crash the pound put pension in peril and explode a tory mortgage bombshell under the home of million of work people will the minister take this opportunity to apologise to the british people on behalf of the conservative party for wreck their hope and aspiration 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his position he have have a feisty morning read his walworth road brief let i offer he the opportunity to correct the record because labour have spend the past month talk down our economy but it be now large than it be when we enter covid and it have recover and grow fast than the economy of both france and germany 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of withdrawal from the eu on the economy 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of withdrawal from the eu on the economy 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of withdrawal from the eu on the economy 
 good morning mr speaker brexit be a choice make by the british people and it remain a big opportunity for the economy rather than relitigate that debate this government be commit to embrace those opportunity 
 prior to the eu referendum the bank of england warn that brexit would seriously damage the uk economy weaken the pound and cause inflation the government have now delay import check on animal and food product for the time because the cost would add to inflation do that mean the chancellor finally accept that brexit be contribute to the uk ’s cost of living crisis 
 no but of course we be sensitive about the timing of introduce those change because of cost of living pressure i be sad to have see since we last meet in the house the hon lady announce that she be step down we have much in common on patient safety on the nhs she will know that because of brexit an extra £ be be direct to public service every year include the nhs and include in scotland 
 adam posen a former member of the monetary policy committee have describe brexit as a 
 trade war by the uk on itself 
 this unnecessary trade war have have a real impact on small business in my constituency such as guild antiques restoration which have find that its order from the eu have fall off a cliff edge and its cost have increase scotland do not choose brexit and we be all bad off as a result what can the chancellor do to fill the economic gap his hard brexit have cause 
 there be a certain irony in the scottish national party oppose brexit at the same time as advocate a far more draconian separation for scotland include a new currency and border check on business in scotland as part of the uk scotland be now an independent coastal state for the time in nearly half a century the people in scotland who work in financial service be benefit from the brexit freedom in the edinburgh reform and there be extra support for scottish pub because for the time we have a low beer duty relative to supermarket 
 it be not just brexit trade barrier have a devastating impact on scotland ’s economy because the loss of freedom of movement have hugely damage our business ability to recruit staff many business have have to reduce their offer cut their opening hour or close altogether it be estimate that over the bank holiday uk pub alone lose out on £ because of staff shortage do the chancellor accept that small business such as those can not keep pick up the tab for his government ’s disastrous brexit what be he do to solve these staff recruitment problem 
 may i gently say to the hon lady that this country have actually grow fast than france or germany since we leave the single market this be a bit of a smokescreen for the snp ’s economic policy which have lead to more people out of work and few people in work in scotland than in england 
 leave the eu give we the opportunity to modernise our regulation and adapt they to local and national domestic interest but we will seize the benefit of do that only if we deliver on regulatory reform so will my right hon friend drive that across department so that we can increase prosperity and raise living standard as a result 
 no know more about regulatory reform than my right hon friend who write an excellent booklet on it we look at that booklet ahead of every fiscal event be it autumn statement or budget i hope that she notice in the budget big reform to our medicine regulation we will continue to learn from the thing she advocate 
 for generation britain ’s world leadership on financial service and financial market have be a key part of our economy i agree that the post brexit initiative such as the edinburgh review have make excellent stride on make sure that we keep that world leadership may i encourage my right hon friend to look at the report from uk finance   on the tokenisation of market as be the world leader in that innovative area would reduce cost for investor enable money to flow into less liquid asset and fundamentally unlock future growth 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question thank to the excellent work of the economic secretary to the treasury we have repeal eu rule and regulation in the financial service sector and we will look very closely at the opportunity when it come to tokenisation 
 i call the shadow economic secretary to the treasury 
 last week the government admit that their plan introduction of food import check from the eu would lead to an increase in inflation hit the pocket of ordinary people during the bad cost of live crisis in our lifetime in the labour party we believe that a bespoke veterinary agreement would cut red tape from business and avoid push cost on to ordinary people be the government plan to negotiate a veterinary agreement and if not why not 
 i gently say to the hon lady who i have a lot of time for that the last thing business want be the upheaval of a huge renegotiation of our trading arrangement with the eu which be the large tariff free free trade deal by volume in the world 
 i welcome the scottish national party spokesperson to his place 
 thank you mr speaker the chancellor claim that it be a success that inflation in the uk have rise higher and remain more stubbornly so than in the eu adam posen formerly of the bank of england have underline that up to of the uk ’s additional inflation woe can be lay at the door of brexit something the tories and labour be unite on all the while food price inflation be crush household budget so why have this government do nothing why have this government learn nothing from country such as france which have work with food supplier to keep food price cap to help those most in need 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his position his constituency predecessor serve as a minister in the treasury whatever greatness the hon gentleman go on to i be sure he will not sully himself with that role when it come to inflation we have a high level of import food like germany a high level of import gas like italy and low unemployment like the united states these factor have come together to give we the inflation rate we have when it come to growth the hon gentleman will have note last week ’s number which show that we have recover well from the pandemic than france italy or germany and we be do extremely well despite all the pressure we face 
 i notice that the chancellor do not say anything about food inflation hurt family well tory and labour little britain attitude do not stop at food price inaction energy cost be a key driver of   inflation and cost for family energy bill be too high the spanish have take bold step by cut vat and introduce a social tariff to help their people this government plan to do nothing for this winter which be particularly gall for people in scotland who will continue to pay more for their energy than elsewhere in the uk will the chancellor act on our demand for a £ energy price grant to be introduce this winter 
 let i tell the hon gentleman what we be do for his constituent and indeed all the people of scotland around £ of support for the average family up and down the country include in scotland pay half people ’s energy bill on average and a huge amount of support through the benefit system nearly £ of support show that we be strong together 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for health and social care on the potential impact of inflation on public health and wellbeing 
 the government be commit to support individual to live healthy life high inflation be the great immediate economic challenge that we must address the government have make it a priority to halve inflation this year we be on the path back to the target of and consumer price index inflation fall to in july we will continue to work with all departments to deal with the inflationary pressure they face 
 be unable to pay for essential such as food heating and rent have an impact on physical and mental health it can lead to delay diagnosis malnutrition and serious mental health problem as the former health secretary will know prevention be well than cure but austerity fly in the face of a preventative approach what discussion have the chancellor have with the secretary of state for health and social care to ensure that the nhs have prevention at its heart will we see a rise in funding in the autumn statement 
 yes i have frequent conversation with the secretary of state and other ministers about health budget we will be increase the public health grant to £ for the next financial year that be to ensure that we have that real term funding protection over the next year but there be a number of other intervention that we be make on deliver service more effectively ensure that we have the provision of additional staff with the long term workforce plan for the nhs none the less i do recognise the challenge that a post covid nhs face in term of the legacy of demand that be yet unmet we be continue to work to bring down waiting list and we have see significant progress recently particularly with year and month list 
 a key part of improve the public health and wellbeing of my local resident in kettering be the redevelopment of kettering general hospital can the chief secretary to the treasury confirm that the £ plus redevelopment of   kgh remain on track for completion by and that the standardisation of the design of the new hospital will help to reduce cost and increase deliverability 
 kettering general hospital be always at the top of my mind when i come to treasury question but the big challenge as my hon friend rightly point out be how we ensure the efficiency of the expenditure of every pound of taxpayer investment in the health estate i shall continue to work with the secretary of state on that plan for the hospital to make sure that we achieve that 
 in the many discussion that the minister say he have have with the secretary of state for health and social care what figure do they discuss with he that he estimate inflation will be at in the next financial year 
 there be a range of forecast but we have to deal with the reality i be try to ensure that across all of the decision that secretaries of state make we reprioritise effectively and deliver frontline service but i do not have a number for the hon gentleman this afternoon 
 people in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke find that mental health be a huge barrier to get back into work and obviously help to produce economic growth that be something that the chancellor be report to have be consider carefully over the summer recess my friend james starkie and i have launch a no time to wait campaign to use some exist health and social care funding to get specialist mental health nurse into gp surgery to help support people in a more preventive way something   the hon member for city of durham mary kelly foy   ask about early what support will the treasury give to help the department of health and social care to enact those plan 
 my hon friend always have constructive suggestion in this difficult area the chancellor bring forward a number of intervention in the budget to get people back into work after some of the behavioural shift that we see follow the pandemic we look forward to continue to work with my hon friend on solution for his community 
 what progress he have make on the introduction of investment zone 
 what progress he have make on the introduction of investment zone 
 investment zone be part of our industrial strategy to make sure that the benefit of our national strength in our growth priority sector be spread throughout the uk 
 i thank my right hon friend for his response the north east of scotland have long be an exemplar of innovation in the field of food and drink and energy to name a few can he confirm that the north east scotland investment zone will lead to more   innovation to promote these key industry not just in aberdeen city but in the wide north east include my constituency of banff and buchan 
 i know that the acorn carbon capture usage and storage project be base at st fergus in my hon friend ’s patch and that banff and buchan be within the north east of scotland region which be of eligible area and have be a long stand global centre for excellence in clean energy so i wish he every success as those discussion with the scottish government continue 
 do the chancellor agree that my constituency of clwyd south that of my hon friend   the member for wrexham sarah atherton   and the rest of north east wales represent of the good candidate for a new investment zone will he also consider make this cross border give our very close economic commercial and cultural tie with the north west of england 
 i know there be some great business in my hon friend ’s constituency i much enjoy meet robin and helen jones of jones village bakery at a recent reception in no and i know they be go from strength to strength i holiday in clwyd last year and from the top of moel famau i see a very impressive offshore wind farm i completely agree that there be enormous potential in clwyd for clean energy and as discussion continue about investment zone i wish he every success as well 
 the uk ’s investment zone be in south yorkshire where the mayor be work hard to develop our world lead advanced manufacturing and innovation district i be sure the chancellor will agree that if we be go to create a growth area we need to make sure people can access the job there via transport link particularly by bus will he make sure that include within the financial package available be money to assist with local public transport 
 i very much enjoy my visit to south yorkshire to open that investment zone it be incredibly impressive what be happen there and it be wonderful to welcome new investment by boeing as part of that the hon gentleman be right to talk about transport that be why we involve local authority in all our investment zone decision it be also vital to have university involve which be why the university of sheffield be play such a key role 
 i be present on the day the chancellor come to launch the investment zone in my constituency and of course i too welcome the investment into boeing there do he accept that of the other area for future development in the investment zone be small modular reactor a consortium be be develop in sheffield with sheffield forgemasters rolls royce and ge hitachi nuclear energy to look at the future not merely to develop the technique for smr but to start build smr in sheffield would he be willing to look at that proposal and hopefully offer support for it 
 i enjoy meet the hon gentleman when we open that investment zone let i reassure he that i be a big supporter of nuclear and i be very   excited about the potential of smr there be a competition go on this year which we hope will be complete by the end of the year to assess the viability of the various smr manufacturer and we want to get go as quickly as we can 
 what discussion he have have with representative of the financial sector on freedom of speech 
 the government have be clear that debanke customer on the basis of political view be unacceptable during recess i meet banking executive to discuss debanking and lawful freedom of expression and they have commit to comply with the change i publish on   july in parallel the financial conduct authority be conduct an urgent review of debanke practice which will report back to the chancellor in the next couple of week 
 last week the met police chief finally seem to confirm that the job of the police should be to police and not to seek to align themselves with entity or ideology do the minister agree with i that bank and the corporate world should follow that example and focus their effort on their core business rather than play the sinister cancel agenda of the woke brigade that see nigel farage have his account wrongfully close 
 my hon friend represent the view of his constituent in this place clearly he be quite right although they be private entity bank benefit from a privileged place in society and they should focus on do their core function brilliantly treat customer fairly and make a sustainable return for shareholder rather than take side on politically contentious matter 
 today it be because some people may have a different political view tomorrow it could be the fact that someone have a different religious viewpoint i be a christian and as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief i stand up for those with christian belief those with other belief and those with no belief because i believe sincerely that they have a right to have that belief if ever the day come when bank censure anybody because they have a different religious belief i would stand up against that do the minister agree 
 let i be clear yes the government agree with that no should be debar from access to banking facility in our society because of a lawfully express view if he and other hon member wish to make representation the financial conduct authority be currently conduct a review of this matter 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the plastic packaging tax 
 in april this year the government announce that we would conduct a formal review of the plastic packaging tax through analysis of environmental and tax datum and customer research to assess the impact of the measure more information about the evaluation will be publish later this year 
 i be pleased to share that a business in my eastbourne constituency have make many important change in the way it operate in order to meet its own environmental ambition but when it come to the transportation of food and pharmaceutical product industry standard link to public health regulation require such product to be transport in sterile packaging which necessitate the use of virgin plastic and bring the container that the business produce into scope for the plastic packaging tax be there a new direction i can share with that business or will ongoing policy review look at such case 
 the aim of the plastic packaging tax be to provide a clear incentive for business to use more recycled plastic in packaging follow extensive consultation we look at a range of possible exemption and decide to limit those exemption because we want to encourage innovation in the industry put simply the more exemption the less innovation however all taxis remain of course under review 
 a proactive approach to a circular economy could create hundred of thousand of job and cut our consumption emission what circular taxation measure be the treasury look at to help we achieve those outcome 
 we be clear that we want all taxis relate to the environment to have an impact the plastic packaging tax for example will clearly have an impact on the amount of recycling that take place and on the amount put into landfill those be all thing that we assess as part of evaluation and the plastic packaging tax will be evaluate this year 
 what step his department be take to incentivise pension scheme to invest in the uk 
 at mansion house the government present a series of pension reform that will increase return for saver and enable the financial sector to unlock capital for some of the uk ’s most promising industry the department continue work to build on the initial package of measure and will set out further detail in the autumn 
 i thank the minister for his answer and welcome those measure have the government consider what more can be do to unlock surplus in define benefit scheme to allow employer to use that money more effectively rather than have it end up go into insurance company on buy out there be a huge tax penalty on unlock surplus be there a way of relieve that to encourage the money to be invest more efficiently 
 my hon friend make an important point with the right precaution it be right that we look at that to incentivise employer to deliver the high return for pension saver 
 the government have to date take £ from the mineworker pension scheme the then cross party business energy and industrial strategy committee conclude that the government should not be profit from mineworker pension how do the secretary of state justify their continue profiteer 
 i be not familiar with the issue that the hon lady speak about i would be very happy to meet she to understand it in more detail 
 what step his department be take to help support pub through the tax system 
 we be ensure that pub remain a key part of our local community by provide support through the alcohol duty and business rate system that include a new draught relief that provide a significant duty discount on alcohol sell on draught in a pub and the expand retail hospitality and leisure relief mean more than £ in relief for the average independent pub 
 after a busy summer knock around south ribble and speak to people i have often pop in for a pint include in croston ’s famous wheatsheaf pub from housing mp surgery as many pub do to be our community live room pub be absolutely vital i have speak to landlord include those at the black bull and the fabulous fleece inn in penwortham 
 get they all in 
 there be a pub crawl there for we all they need our support so may i invite the minister to south ribble i will even offer to buy she a pint to speak to chris the landlord at longton ’s fabulous golden ball to hear about his business 
 as you know mr speaker i regard lancashire as my home and it would be a delight to return to south ribble my hon friend have name just a few of the roughly pub in england and wales perhaps if we have give she long she would have be able to name they all all those pub will benefit from the brexit pub guarantee which mean that the duty on a pint sell in a pub will always be low than in a supermarket 
 let we see if the minister be go to get another pint i call tim farron 
 follow the question from my dad ’s mp i confess that i have be to all the pub that   the hon member for south ribble katherine fletcher   mention the big burden on pub in the lake and the dale be the fact that they can not find any staff or sufficient staff it   be a crisis that affect the entire hospitality sector of which say that the recruitment of staff be a major problem for they the solution will include more affordable home for worker more intelligent visa rule and fund new training and skill initiative will the minister meet i and representative of the hospitality industry to look at a bespoke package to solve the workforce crisis in the lake and the dale 
 i would go far and give as an example the truly transformational programme that the chancellor set out at the spring budget to transform childcare policy in this country we know that childcare responsibility hold back many people from enter the workforce and it be through policy such as this as well as the work be lead by the secretary of state for work and pensions to help people back into the workforce that will help pub in the hon gentleman ’s constituency and across the country 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 on friday the office for national statistics publish an update to the uk ’s gdp growth figure which show that the uk economy be large than pre pandemic level by the quarter of it mean that our economy have the fast recovery from the pandemic of any large european economy thank to decision such as furlough that protect million of job for that growth to continue we need to halve inflation which i be pleased to report be now nearly below its peak i can also tell the house that i will deliver the autumn statement on   november 
 stay on the subject of pub carshalton and wallington be also lucky to be home to some excellent pub include the hope which be this year ’s campaign for real ale greater london pub of the year recipient will the chancellor expand a bit more on the work that the treasury be do to support pub not just in the tax system but far afield and will he join i in wish carshalton and wallington ’s pub good luck in the local pub of the year competition later on 
 i very much wish my hon friend ’s local pub the good of luck in that competition only to my desire to encourage south west surrey pub to do well i want to reassure he that we believe that pub be central to our national life that be why we have provide relief on business rate of up to for pub and as we hear early the brexit pub guarantee help on their duty pricing 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 last week thousand of parent be tell that their child ’s school be unsafe and at risk of collapse the defining image of year of conservative government classroom prop up to stop the ceiling from fall in capital budget have halve in real term since with warning   ignore and repair programme slash do this conservative government take any responsibility for any of this 
 let i start by reassure the right hon lady that the vast majority of pupil in the school affect be at school normally and we be act fast to minimise the impact on the rest 
 let i answer the more general question that the right hon lady raise yes we make cut in spending in because as she know well the last labour government leave this country with an economic crisis despite that crisis the department for education budget have go up by in real term and overall capital spend 
 order this be topical all your colleague on both side of the house want to get in topical be mean to be very short not a full debate between both side i say to everybody think about other i think we can move on i call rachel reeves 
 i will repeat capital budget have halve in real term since i understand indeed i know that in the lead up to the spending review the department for education make a submission to the treasury about the danger of the deteriorate school estate include from reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete those warning be ignore by the then chancellor the current prime minister and we have see the consequence so will today ’s chancellor do the right thing and publish the department for education ’s submission to the last spending review 
 capital spending at the department for education go up in real term in that review be the difference not that with the fast recovery in europe the conservatives build an economy that can pay for our school and hospital and labour run out of money 
 for month we have have the labour economics team run down british business berate they for not grow fast enough and ignore the fact that the oecd show that the british economy have grow fast since than germany italy spain or france with the recently announce office for national statistics upgrade that the chancellor just refer to what be his more hopeful message to british business 
 it be very simply this since we have become the strong economy in europe in film and television life science and technology and the opportunity be great with a conservative government 
 this week school have fail to reopen due to the threat of collapse worryingly the danger do not end there because of school and public building be estimate to contain asbestos which be describe by mesothelioma uk as a silent killer will the chancellor stop ignore his own department and commit to provide the necessary funding so that our child can be prevent from be teach in crumble asbestos ride deathtrap 
 i do not accept that characterisation at all i do understand the impact of mesothelioma as my father die of it but   this government have invest £ to keep school safe since and the chancellor have set out other figure as well 
 some call go unanswered at his majesty ’s revenue and customs last year of those who do get through third have to wait more than minute meanwhile out of hmrc staff be work from home what be be do to improve the appalling level of customer service at hmrc 
 i thank my hon friend for his question which i take very seriously just to put it in context last year hmrc receive telephone call around of those be to do the simple of task which can be do digitally if at all possible if we be able to move people on to digital channel that will free up at least people to help with more complex tax affair and help the most vulnerable this be a period of transition for the organisation and that we take very seriously 
 i recently conduct an energy survey in dalmarnock which bring heartbreaking story of pensioner go to bed early to save money on their energy and many household struggle to pay the bill even in summer do the minister not agree that dalmarnock resident and people right across scotland would benefit from a £ energy rebate this winter as the snp propose 
 we step in during the energy crisis with £ of support include the energy price guarantee which effectively pay for half of people ’s energy bill that be important while energy price be high wholesale gas price have now come down 
 as the minister know free access to cash be a vital lifeline for many people include some of the most vulnerable in all our constituency can he confirm what step he be take to ensure that free access be protect and continue to be available across the country particularly in north warwickshire and bedworth 
 during the summer we announce that we have give direction to the financial conduct authority in respect of access to cash it should be no more than mile in an urban area and no more than mile in my hon friend ’s rural constituency of north warwickshire that be the time that the statutory right of access to cash have exist in law 
 prison officer tell i that they be at break point a key source of despair and anger be their pension age of which we should all agree be far too late as the treasury lead on public sector pension scheme policy will the chancellor allow the ministry of justice to restart negotiation to resolve this grossly unfair and dangerous situation 
 i have not hear that matter raise before but i be very happy to take it back and correspond with the hon lady on it obviously we have take   advice on the state pension age and have make clear our policy previously but i be happy to look at any specific case she raise 
 can i ask my right hon friend when a fiscal review of all offshore energy activity will be carry out to ensure that we be maximise investment opportunity in critical energy infrastructure such as offshore wind carbon capture and storage and hydrogen as well as while we still need it domestic oil and gas 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that issue i actually have a breakfast with clean energy industry representative this morning to discuss their concern there be a huge amount of potential investment and he be right to say that maximise the use of our own oil and gas reserve during transition be a vital part of our energy security policy 
 will the chancellor consider introduce a windfall tax on bank excess profit the profit of the big bank for the half of this year be up compare with yet the bank of england be forecast to pay out as much as £ in interest on reserve to bank in at the same time as the government have cut the level of surcharge on bank profit by 
 with million of british job dependent on financial service include an estimate job in brighton and hove i hope the hon lady will join i in celebrate a sustainably profitable financial sector it be only that that give we the ability to invest in skill and technology 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 will the economic secretary update the house on the progress he be make to enable our constituent to access personalised financial guidance if they be among the of our constituent who can not afford regulated financial advice 
 my hon friend the chair of the treasury committee make a really important point about what be call the advice gap treasury official the fca and i be consult on that and i will publish an update this autumn 
 it have be reveal that integrated debt services a company set up by the uk government to recover personal debt see its profit increase by a staggering last year do minister think it be right that this company should be able to profit to that extent out of the misery of the cost of living crisis 
 the hon gentleman be refer to a company that work with the government ’s crown commercial service and that work on debt across central government it have to operate within a very specific framework and indeed it be regulate by the financial conduct authority i very much understand the point he have raise and i will be make inquiry on that point myself 
 research and development tax credit be vital to help business grow and invest but i have receive a large number of complaint from business across essex say that they be face complexity and delay in processing claim with hmrc may i please ask the minister to meet i and some of these business to work through the delay and ensure that these business can continue to thrive and grow because they be vital to our economic growth 
 i would be delighted to meet my right hon friend and those business in fact the uk be lead world economy with our focus on life science and on tech in that little golden triangle between oxford cambridge and london we have more tech business than anywhere else on the planet other than new york and silicon valley i hear the cheer opposite so keen be labour member to support british business but i would be delighted to meet she and to underline the support that this government give to such important business 
 i welcome the new focus on engage pension fund with productive investment after many year when regulation have push the fund into government gilt instead but do the minister have proposal specifically to secure those investment for uk business rather than their go overseas 
 the right hon member make a significant contribution to the debate about the nation ’s pension fund our objective to increase investment to drive increase return for pension saver but also to benefit the wide economy stop short of mandate there be a philosophical difference between this side of the house and the opposition we do not believe it be right for the chancellor to tell pension fund where to invest but it be our job to knock down barrier friction and impedance to pension fund invest in brilliant british company 
 the economic secretary tell my hon friend   the member for north warwickshire craig tracey   that he be go to underwrite the statutory right of access to cash but bank branch will have close by the end of the year leave only in place and atm have close in the last year how be he go to make sure that this actually happen rather than it just be an empty promise 
 the fca have significant sanction in respect of the closure of atm that would leave community without the right of free access to cash on the closure of bank branch we be see a significant change and i hope my right hon friend would respect the fact that technology be change and consumer pattern be change during the recess i have the privilege of visit the excellent community banking hub in brixham which i think be a brilliant opportunity there should be more than on their way and that be my objective 
 do the chancellor accept that many people see income tax rate at the moment as exceptionally punitive and   do he also accept that there be a need to move as quickly as possible into a growth base economy and to supercharge our economy in the united kingdom 
 as a conservative i want to bring taxis down as soon as we can afford to do so and i be very proud that for the time ever people can earn £ a month without pay a penny of tax or national insurance 
 as we want to expand our financial service industry not only in this country but abroad we need to build confidence among consumer that the right thing to do be invest do my hon friend therefore agree that it be vital that regulator respond to and deal with complaint to they and actually impose sanction against those who breach the regulation 
 yes i agree with my hon friend on this matter it be reason why we have beef up the role of the financial regulator review commissioner and we will also be require the regulator to publish regular operating metric on their performance to give consumer the trust they need 
 back in both the treasury and the financial conduct authority know there be problem with the prepay funeral plan market since then my constituent gary godwin of nantyglo lose over £ to the collapse of a company call safe hands across the uk thousand more have lose million of pound altogether will the minister please meet i to discuss this scandal and mr godwin ’s case 
 yes i will be very happy to meet the hon gentleman what happen with safe hands be a scandal and that be why we have enlarge the regulatory perimeter to bring those who seek to sell funeral plan within the regulatory conduct 
 over the summer port have be bid to the government ’s infrastructure fund to help they get ready for the delivery of the new float offshore wind industry may i encourage ministers to look favourably on the bid from the celtic sea port of milford haven and port talbot because those port be key to unlock the enormous economic benefit of this new clean energy industry 
 i be absolutely happy to do that and i agree with my right hon friend about the enormous potential of those area 
 some gp practice be at risk of be price out of city centre include in place like st albans because of outdated treasury rule that prevent integrate care board from spend the money they want to on a gp practice location health ministers have confirm to i that their official be happy to work with treasury official may i ask for a personal assurance from treasury ministers that they will encourage their official to look at this and resolve it by the end of this year at the absolute late 
 dialogue be ongoing on this matter and i can confirm that we will continue to work on this in the come week 
 andy haldane the former bank of england chief economist recently say in a sky news interview that the bank of england keep on print money for long than it need to it be clear that central bank across the world have be addict to cheap money and that this have contribute to inflation across the world do the chancellor agree that print cheap and easy money have not be without consequence and instead our monetary policy must focus on important growth factor such as productivity 
 i agree with what my hon friend say the bank of england itself have say there be problem with its inflation forecasting it be learn the lesson from that and we must support it every step of the way as it bring down inflation 
 sorry i be late today mr speaker british airways cancel my flight 
 when the chancellor ’s predecessor now the prime minister be chancellor there be huge fraud in the bounce back loan have he get any of that money back yet 
 we be always ferociously determined to recover money obtain through fraud but because of those bounce back loan we have the fast recovery of any major european country 
 i have recently be contact by several self employ constituent express concern about heavy fine be impose for file tax return late even though no money be owe will the treasury meet i with a view perhaps to review this policy 
 i will of course be happy to meet my hon friend i hope he understand that i can not intervene personally in any case but i will of course look at the general principle he set out and see whether there be systemic issue here 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities if they will make a statement on the government ’s decision to use the levelling up and regeneration bill to scrap environmental protection on nutrient neutrality 
 the secretary of state for levelling up table a write ministerial statement yesterday on the government ’s plan but i be happy to provide an update to the house in propose these amendment we be respond to call from local 
 order may i just say that it be very good of you to offer to give that update i decide that it be an urgent question i expect ministers to come to the house as i do not think a write ministerial statement be the way to inform the house 
 i be delighted to be here to answer this urgent question 
 in propose the amendment we be respond to call from local council which want the government to take action to allow they to deliver the home their community need at present legacy eu law on nutrient neutrality be block the delivery of new home include in case where planning permission have already be grant this have affect home building of all type whether that be the redevelopment of empty space above high street shop affordable housing scheme new care home or family build their own home the block on building be hamper local economy and threaten to put small and medium sized local builder out of business nutrient enter our river be a real problem but the contribution make by new home be very small compare with that of other source such as agriculture industry and our exist housing stock and the judgment be that nutrient neutrality have so far do little to improve water quality 
 we be already take action across government to mandate water company to improve their waste water treatment work to the high technically achievable limit those provision alone will more than offset the nutrient expect from new housing development but we need to go far fast that be why as well as propose target amendment to the habitat regulation the government be commit to a package of environmental measure central to that be £ of funding to natural england to deliver strategic mitigation sufficient to offset the very small amount of additional nutrient discharge attributable to up to home between now and we have also announce more than £ for slurry management and agricultural innovation in nutrient management and a commitment to accelerate protect site strategy in the most affected catchment 
 in our overall approach there will be no loss of environmental outcome and we be confident that our package of measure will improve the environment   nutrient neutrality be only ever an interim solution with funding in place and by put these site on a trajectory to recovery we feel confident in make this legislative intervention 
 i find it extraordinary that the minister can stand there and make that statement with a straight face over the past year ministers have stand at that dispatch box and promise time and again that leave the european union would not lead to a weakening of environmental standard those of we who raise our concern have repeatedly be tell that we be scaremongere as recently as   june the solicitor general say in relation to the retained eu law revocation and reform bill that 
 we will not lower environmental protection ”—[official report   june vol c. 
 yet here we have it proposal to unpick the habitat directive and to disapply the nutrient neutrality rule that protect our precious river and sensitive ecosystem 
 the office for environmental protection have itself make clear that the proposal 
 would demonstrably reduce the level of environmental protection provide for in exist environmental law they be a regression 
 i underline that point to   the hon member for redcar jacob young who be chuntere from his seat on the front bench the proposal go directly against the polluter pay principle by force the taxpayer rather than house builder to foot the bill for mitigate increase water pollution from house building in environmentally sensitive area what be particularly infuriate be that as the name suggest the nutrient neutrality rule be not even about improve our environment but simply about try to prevent pollution from get bad 
 let i ask the minister some important question on transparency will the government follow the oep ’s call for they to make a statement as require by section 20(4 of the environment act admit that they can no long say that the levelling up and regeneration bill would not reduce environmental protection in law will the minister explain how the government will meet their objective for water quality and protect site condition when they be at the same time weaken environmental law what advice do ministers receive from natural england before the amendment be table will she explain why there have there be a complete lack of consultation with environment group will she also explain what consultation there be with house builder whom member will have notice be cock a hoop about the announcement and the subsequent boost to their share price 
 will the minister admit that it be a false choice to pit house building against environmental protection when there be successful project under way to address nutrient pollution will the government provide evidence for their unsubstantiated claim that home be be delay as a consequence of these rule will she recognise that money which can easily be take away at a later stage be not the same as a legal requirement to stop pollution get into our river 
 i thank the hon lady for her long list of question i be happy to respond to all of they in detail on our approach i stand by what i and the government have say we stand by our pledge to the   environment and we do not accept that as she state we will weaken our commitment to the environment at all it be important to consider what we be talk about here which be unblock home that add very little in term of pollution to be clear our approach mean that there will be no overall loss in environmental outcome not only do the measure that we be take address the very small amount of nutrient run off from new housing but at the same time we be invest in the improvement of environmental outcome we do not agree that this be regression on environmental standard we be take direct action to continue to protect the environment and ensure that housing can be bring forward in area where people need it 
 the hon lady ask about engagement minister across government the secretary of state and i have have numerous meeting with all party involve and we have have meeting with environment group as part of government business it be worth the house note the significant enforcement step take on the water company by colleague at the department for environment food and rural affairs since the environment agency have conclude prosecution against water and sewerage company secure £ in fine the regulator have recently launch the large criminal and civil investigation into water company sewage we be take action against water company to protect our river leave the environment in a well state than we find it and build the affordable house that the country so desperately need include in her constituency 
 the minister will recognise that i and many other colleague on the government side of the house share the admirable objective of   the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas   in ensure that the water quality of our river improve year by year under the government and their successor the minister ’s proposal to amend the levelling up and regeneration bill be not about damage the status of our river as i understand it they be about deal with a particular and specific interpretation of the eu habitat directive by the european court of justice in connection with a case in holland prior to the time we leave the eu if that be the case she have refer to the litigation and measure she have undertake do she agree that in special area of conservation such as the river clun catchment in my constituency where no planning consent have be grant for year these measure will help to unlock that while preserve the quality of the river in the catchment 
 you have take long than the person who ask the question 
 i thank my right hon friend very much he be right in his observation that this have be a judgment impose on the united kingdom after we leave the european union this be not a long stand convention in any shape or form he be also right to highlight the measure we be put in place to protect our river and the environment more broadly we be also put in place a substantial package to help farmer to farm more sustainability manage their slurry infrastructure more effectively and be able to drive the circular economy in farming that we all want he mention specific   catchment in his area we have commit to bring forward a wye catchment plan shortly which i hope will address the issue he be refer to 
 i call clive betts interruption 
 i be happy to go but the shadow minister 
 oh sorry it have take so long i think we must have move on to back benchers i call the shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker as a result of the government ’s failure over many year to make decisive progress in tackle the main source of problem nutrient namely farming and waste water treatment work the requirement for nutrient neutrality in sensitive river catchment present a challenge to secure planning permission for new housing development it be therefore right in labour ’s view that the operation of the rule around nutrient neutrality be review with a view to address problematic delay and increase the pace at which home can be deliver in these area 
 however we have serious concern about the approach that the government have decide on not only do it involve disapplye the conservation of habitats and species regulations but it do not legally secure the additional funding pledge to deliver nutrient management programme and do not provide for a legal mechanism to ensure that housing developer contribute towards mitigation 
 i put the following question to the minister what advice do the government receive from natural england about potential reform of the law around nutrient neutrality do it offer a view on the government ’s propose approach give the amount of mitigation currently available in the pipeline which be estimate at allow for approximately home do the government consider an approach base on the habitat regulation assessment derogation and a revise credit mitigation system to front load permission and provide for future compensatory scheme if so why do they dismiss that option what assessment have the government make of the impact of their propose approach on the nascent market in mitigation credit and investor confidence in nature market more generally why on earth do minister believe developer will voluntarily contribute to mitigation under the propose approach 
 finally the government claim their approach will see planning permission expedite between now and give that house building activity be fall sharply and the pipeline for future development be be squeeze not least as a result of housing and planning policy decision make by this conservative government what assessment have the department make of the number of permission that its disruptive approach will unlock within the month of its operation 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and remark i take they to mean that he will support the measure when they come before the house i be delighted to hear his support for our sensible practical and pragmatic approach to unblock much need housing across the country he ask about our engagement with natural england we have have detailed discussion he ask about the current legal framework   we have look at and discuss a number of option to make the change and we be take what we believe be the right approach to unblock planning permission more quickly than the current situation allow 
 the hon gentleman refer to nature market he be right to highlight the groundbreaking work we be do across that piece we be continue with our commitment to those nature market which be a very important part of the government ’s plan to keep our environment protect it and leave it in a well state than we find it that be what the conservative government have always be commit to and continue to be 
 the hon gentleman be right to say that we have speak to developer who of course support our objective we have very constructive dialogue with the developer who be happy to contribute we will have those discussion with industry as i be sure he have hear from developer because i know he have speak to they all we be on the side of those builder it be important to say that the developer most affect by the disproportionate ruling from the european court of justice be not the big developer but the small and medium sized enterprise the small builder some of which have go bust it be right that we stand behind they 
 i warmly congratulate the government on take action on this very serious issue i welcome sincerely the remark from the opposition spokesperson offer qualified support for what be be do we have an issue whereby home span council area be be block those home have planning permission already grant but can not be build because of the perverse legacy ruling more to the point could my hon friend confirm that there be no environmental impact because we be double investment in the nutrient mitigation scheme that be as well as develop protect site strategy for those catchment area affect most severely by the nutrients issue which overwhelmingly be not cause by new housing do she agree that the real challenge should be lay down to   the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas   on what she would say to all the hundred of thousand of young family out there who can not buy a home in the place they need and want at a price they can afford 
 my right hon friend have considerable expertise in this matter he be right to focus on the mechanism we need to bring forward to enable the much need planning permission to take effect his region in particular be affect by this issue and i know his constituent and people across the region will be desperate to see those home build to allow people a step on the property ladder we be about build   a property own democracy 
 my right hon friend be also right to say that we can do that at the same time as protect the environment which be why we have double the funding for natural england ’s nutrient mitigation scheme we be invest £ in slurry management infrastructure and we be help farmer with a £ sustainable package to help they invest in innovative farming technique to manage their nutrient more sustainably   which can be of benefit to their farm and agricultural process we be go much far on those protect site so that we deal with the problem at source that be what we need to focus on 
 i call the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee 
 this be hardly a new problem be it the court decision be in yet last year we have the levelling up bill which be really a planning bill with a bit of level up add on no mention of the issue there in december we have major consultation on change to the national planning policy framework no mention of the issue there the committee write to the minister and ask how many more consultation on planning issue there would be this year we be give of they no mention of the issue there if it be such a serious issue why have it take the government so long to act it look like the government be make it up as they go along this be a panicked response from the government to the collapse number of housing start which the minister simply want to do something anything about 
 i very much value the hon gentleman ’s scrutiny of the government ’s record and i very much enjoy come before his committee we have discuss this issue and many other with his committee in the past it be right that we be take this action it be a serious and complex issue and we need time to consider all the legal aspect of it however what i come back to time and time again be that we need to unblock planning permission we need housing all over the country we be do that at the same time as protect the environment and i very much hope to have further dialogue with he about this in the future 
 it be always baffle to hear those who believe in environmental improvement say that only the eu way work do the minister agree with i that outside the eu we have be able to adapt our law to what work for this country and also make improvement such as marine protect area and provide support to agriculture outside the common agricultural policy to say that leave the eu have mean a degradation in our approach to the environment be simply nonsense 
 my right hon friend speak from vast experience on this issue i can do no more than agree strongly with every word leave the eu allow we to make the law that be right for our country most specifically in the area of build the home we need across his area and across the whole country the point here be also that the eu legacy judgment have not improve the quality of the water that be why we be take further step to mitigate the problem at source everybody who care about the quality of water should welcome that 
 the uk be of the most nature deplete country in the world the government have just set up the office for environmental protection i be on the environment bill committee when we do that which say that this planning change be a regression in environmental protection we should   not just throw out the rule when they be a bit difficult what advice do the government receive from natural england the minister say she speak with it on its approach to problem nutrient do natural england green light the proposal or be it be ignore along with the office for environmental protection 
 natural england be a government partner we work very closely with it as well as with local planning authority we rely on natural england to carry out some of the mitigation scheme the nutrient credit scheme and many other in response to the office for environmental protection we have a different view the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   set out very clearly her response to the office for environmental protection we do not agree with it fundamentally we do not agree that this be a regression in environmental outcome overall 
 it be perfectly possible to make housing development nitrate neutral in the place bearwood development in my constituency contain over new house and be nitrate neutral through sustainable drainage and building technique so we can have new home without compromise our environment and without take good quality farm land out for mitigation will my hon friend ensure that planning law match that ambition 
 i thank my hon friend very much she be right to focus on some of the very good work that be already take place through some individual project i be aware be be bring forward she be also right to highlight the role that sustainable drainage can take and we have commit to look at that more broadly to see what more can be do with that particular policy planning law be very clear it have to leave the environment in a well state than it find it not only in her area but across the country 
 of course we need more housing but in my constituency the sewer be over capacity victorian and clap out i invite the minister to meet some of the household where in time of heavy rain raw sewage not only pollute the environment but float around the street the garden and even the kitchen it be simply not acceptable to imagine we can somehow wave a wand to solve the housing problem finally may i draw the attention of the house to an excellent website call top of the poops which state that in my constituency there be hour of sewage last year alone that be completely unacceptable 
 defra minister have be at this dispatch box multiple time to update colleague on the work that the government be proud to do as part of the plan for water this be the most ambitious and stringent package that have be bring forward to tackle this abhorrent issue we agree with the hon gentleman that storm overflow and sewage overflow be wrong that be why the £ of new accelerated investment will be direct into vital infrastructure we be clear that the volume of sewage discharge into our water be unacceptable and that be why we have take action in term of strong regulation more fine and   tough enforcement across the board to tackle every source of river and sea pollution 
 as the minister know the level of somerset be some of the most environmentally enhance area in the uk natural england have destroy chance for development we be about to start build the tata factory the large factory that this country have see for a long time that need to be sort and i would like the minister ’s thought conversely the reality also slip south west water which be an abomination have just announce it will stop pollutant from hectare by can we please have a grip on the reality of both side of this issue if we do not nothing will be develop in part that be environmentally sensitive 
 i be aware that my hon friend represent an area with acute environmental sensitivity and he be right to raise those concern on the floor of the house we work across government not only to tackle the storm overflow issue to which he refer but to find a way to allow house building and other type of building that be much need to drive job and investment and to support business in his constituency without that have a weakening effect on our environment 
 i wonder if i could pick up on something the minister say a moment ago natural england be not a government partner it be a government agency so far as this issue be concern it be literally the government this rule have exist since and the government ’s guidance on it have indeed get in the way of genuinely affordable environmentally sustainable housing scheme in the lake district and i be sure elsewhere the answer be not to scrap it but to change the guidance to make it more intelligent so that we protect our waterway and our landscape from pollution without prevent vital development why do the government spend year dither before panic overreact and then act in line with their own nature by damage british nature 
 the hon gentleman make his point in his usual way but without confront the reality of the situation that affect his constituent of course natural england be a government partner and a government body we work in partnership with natural england we work constructively with it to tackle these complex legal issue i be sure he would be the to jump up and complain if we take action too quickly without consider the consequence as it be what we be do be a sensible proportionate measure to allow much need development in the lake district home for his constituent that have the planning permission to be build finally 
 labour run kirklees council be sit on million of pound of unspent section developer contribution for local infrastructure much of that unspent cash be for environmental project what confidence should we in my area have that our shambolic labour run kirklees council will be able to deliver these mitigation environmental project when it be actually not deliver for our local environment as it be 
 my hon friend be completely right to raise the record in his word the shambolic record of his local labour run council what i can say to reassure he and other colleague be that i have engage with local authority leader to explain to they exactly what this change mean for they what we expect they to do and what they should be do on behalf of their resident to make sure the money be spend properly to protect the river sea and lake and get house build 
 be it not the case that the only one block the development of the house that we need include genuinely affordable social housing a pitiful number be build last year i think it be just over be those on the government bench it be the tory government who be the blocker of housing development to meet housing need that be the case be it not minister 
 it might sound very nice on the hon gentleman ’s facebook clip but if he actually look at the fact he will find it be conservative run council that have on the whole deliver more house over the last few year in respond to the need of their constituent and labour run council that be experience significant failure in deliver the house that their resident need 
 the minister have lift a blight from my constituency but as a result of these measure we be all go to be swim in clean water as well be n’t we 
 we be and i look forward to join my right hon friend in swim in some clean water very soon 
 the minister rightly say that too many house building company be go bust but may i gently suggest that that be a consequence of the government ’s crash the economy last year inflation push up the cost of material and a skill shortage the government claim that their approach will see permission expedite between now and but give this context what be that assessment actually base on and have the minister consult local authority 
 yes we have consult local authority and i make no apology for stand up and take action when it be need to help small builder in particular the diversity of the sector in this country unlike that in other country be disproportionately skew towards large developer and it be therefore right for we as a conservative government to back small business we understand what people go through to start a business which be why we be take action to help they 
 i welcome the government ’s balanced approach which will improve the long term quality of the river stour in my constituency while allow much need planning permission for new home to start again thousand of people very sensibly want to live in ashford and they want to see new home build not least in accordance with the local plan rather than be build opportunistically around the place which be what the delay in permission have   lead to can the minister give we some indication of a timescale and when council such as ashford can start grant planning permission again 
 my right hon friend be entirely correct and i thank he for his support we need to wait for the levelling up and regeneration bill to achieve royal assent it must of course undergo parliamentary scrutiny in both houses but we be work apace we have already start that engagement with local authority and partner natural england and other to ensure that they have all the operational detail that they need what we need to see be spade in the ground as soon as possible 
 it be clear from the minister ’s reply that her statutory adviser natural england oppose this move so will she please publish its advice instead of let developer and water company off the hook and pour even more sewage into our waterway why do she not take the advice of her right hon friend   the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke   and reverse the prime minister ’s disastrous decision to scrap local housing target which have give nimby council carte blanche to do nothing 
 what i take issue with in the right hon gentleman ’s question plural be his comment that we scrap housing target we have do no such thing we be commit to build home during this parliament and we have the target of build home every year that be a very important target that we stand by what we be do unlike the labour party be take account of local community what labour would do be build all over the green belt and i can tell the house that its own mp be not in favour of that they be block development in their constituency what we have be a sensible proportionate approach to build the right house in the right place 
 what the negative social medium debate about all this have mask be the fact that a significant amount of work be be do to create conserve and improve wetland around the country the all party parliamentary group for wetland which i chair be support the drive by the wildfowl wetlands trust to create additional hectare of wetland in this country and we would also like to see a dedicated domestic wetland team in defra to repeat its success in peat productivity will my hon friend give we more information about how expert organisation such as the wwt in slimbridge in my patch can apply for the £ to continue positive progress on environmental matter and will she assist my effort to get the wetland team up and run 
 i know that my hon friend do extremely good work on behalf of slimbridge and other wetland in her area i should be delighted to meet she and to read any of the report produce by her appg i think it important to stress again that the package to be deliver through the work of natural england and the credit scheme must continue and we will be boost they because we know of the benefit that they have for my hon friend ’s area and many other 
 do the minister accept that the propose investment in the natural england nutrient mitigation scheme cover only of the total mitigation requirement to where will the additional fund require to address the shortfall come from 
 i do not accept that figure and i do not know where the hon lady get it those scheme be very much in progress at the moment on an ongoing basis we be work through some of the detail i should also mention that as well as the natural england scheme we have the government ’s own scheme administer by my department which we will be able to deliver throughout the country 
 do the minister agree that there be a flaw in the way in which the office for environmental protection have reach its determination in this matter it can take into account only what be in the bill it can not take into account the other measure that the minister have mention the natural england nutrient neutrality programme and the investment in slurry management surely to form a more coherent view of the environmental impact of these measure it be necessary to look at all measure in the round not just legislative measure 
 my hon friend be of course extremely perceptive and he be absolutely correct we present an ambitious package overall and that mean we can meet head on the challenge of deliver the much need planning permission that my hon friend will no doubt welcome in his area which i know need more housing and also protect and enhance our environment in its recent comment the office for environmental protection have interpret this in a very narrow fashion and we do not necessarily agree with its assessment 
 i know that the minister have struggle previously with what constitute retain eu legislation but what we be talk about today be an amendment to the conservation of habitats and species regulations the challenge before the minister be that this government pledge on the record not once but time during the debate on the bill that become the retained eu law revocation and reform act that they would not reduce those explicit environmental protection will she say now whether that pledge to match those environmental protection directly remain or do she want to take this opportunity to correct the record and admit that the government ’s word on the environment be not worth the paper it be write on 
 i think that what i be struggle with be the fact that the hon lady clearly do not listen to my previous comment on this matter i have say a great many time that we do not agree that this be a regression in environmental outcome and we stand by that we be the conservative government and we be commit to leave the environment in a well state than the in which we find it that be back up by a strong package of action across numerous area 
 my constituency be of the worst affect place in the entire country with planning application hold up and thousand   of people at risk of lose their job we be talk not about large construction company but about everyday job builder people with family to feed this be a great step towards get the country move again and solve an intractable problem 
 may i ask the minister a very simple question if i build a small house or put a little extension on the side of my current house be i really damage the watercourse to the same degree as pig farming and chicken farming be these well intend law completely miss the mark of what they be intend to do in the place 
 the simple answer to my hon friend ’s question be that he be right the exist legal framework that have be hinder we have have a disproportionate effect on plan permission and house building when the main source of the pollution lie elsewhere overall this package will be able to deliver house building and extension in my hon friend ’s constituency help the small builder and of course protect our river 
 in an industrial area such as teesside environmental standard be critical include around water quality and our riverside will the new policy framework lead to increase fund for the canal river trust which have see its budget decimate in recent year lead to huge cut in its activity and the removal of every single litter bin on its land around the river tees 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise the concern of the canal river trust i be sure that his comment will have be hear by defra ministers but i will be happy to take those concern back to they and ask they to provide an answer 
 follow the question from   the hon member for stroud siobhan baillie   on mitigation the government ’s focus seem to be on wetland but if we be honest it will take a long time to fully mitigate the possible additional pollution what will be do in the interim to deal with this pollution before the wetland become fully operational 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the fact that there be a focus on wetland but other project be in scope of the credit scheme however she have hit the nail on the head the key point be that some of these thing take a very long time to come on stream but we need to start unblock those house now which be why we have take this proportionate approach with the amendment 
 over the summer i meet member of the bedfordshire great ouse valley environment trust they be concerned that our river be the most polluted in england with forever toxin the level be a shocking time that consider safe not to mention raw sewage and nitrate and phosphate contamination can the minister explain to my constituent why the government be decrease protection for our beautiful river when what be need be an urgent plan to clean up our dirty waterway
