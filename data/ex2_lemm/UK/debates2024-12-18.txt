 proper paternity and maternity pay be essential for break the link between current income and further life opportunity for family currently in father do not take the paternity leave available to they because it be financially inadequate inadequate paternity leave drive family inequality increase the gender pay gap as woman pick up great caring responsibility and lower household income do the minister agree that while the conservative party might think that pay parental leave be too high we on the labour benches recognise its crucial role in give child the good start in life what action be minister consider to well support parent and family 
 i strongly agree with my hon friend that while the conservatives have say that they think parental leave be excessive we want to give family more choice through the employment rights bill we will make paternity leave available from day in a new job and enable it to be take after share parental leave we be also commit to review the parental leave system to ensure that it well support work family 
 independent research from the social mobility foundation highlight a stark class pay gap with professional from working class background earn on average less than their more privileged counterpart in the same role and in people from low socioeconomic background find it difficult to get high skilled managerial and professional occupation despite the fact that socioeconomic background remain of the big determinant in chance for life for young people in this country few large organisation monitor it will the minister consider mandate large organisation to monitor socioeconomic background so that we can properly highlight social mobility and give it the attention that it deserve 
 i share my hon friend ’s concern in this area which be why we be commit to enact the socioeconomic duty of the equality act and we shall give more information on this in due course i also encourage business and organisation to collect datum where they can so that we can take action to tackle some of those deep root inequality that my hon friend describe 
 merry christmas to you and your mr speaker

 i agree with my hon friend that it be absolutely crucial that we take action on regional inequality he champion that cause very strongly on his constituent behalf he will know that we have set out an ambitious plan for the future of the minimum wage and we be take action to make sure that all worker receive more money in their pocket to spend he also draw our attention to the importance of child have a great start in life which be why we as a   government be commit to make sure that more child than ever arrive at school and get the support they need so that by the end of reception they be ready to move on to the next stage in their journey 
 in the city of london of the big remain challenge be to ensure that the maximum number of people from the wide socioeconomic background can get into that industry recently i meet people from progress together vincent keaveny a recent lord mayor of the city of london have make massive progress to understand that the data collection process do not need to be expensive will the secretary of state get in touch with her ministerial colleague and the financial conduct authority to alert they to the opportunity to collect datum at little expense which would really raise the profile of the remain challenge 
 i be more than happy to do that i congratulate the right hon gentleman on his work in this area and the attention that he have draw to it because it be a cause that we can all get behind there be more that employer can be ask to do as he describe and more that we can do as a government that be why it be important that all young people have access to good work experience and career guidance so that they understand the full range of opportunity out there in the world 
 woman carer be far more likely to reduce their work hour or give up work entirely to look after their love one put they at a significant financial disadvantage do the secretary of state agree that the lib dem policy to reform social care and introduce free personal care would keep more woman in work for long 
 i understand the hon lady ’s important point she will know that in the budget we increase the threshold for the carer ’s allowance and deliver a big boost to the payment that people can receive but i understand the wide challenge that she set out around social care that be why the health secretary be take action to ensure that we transform social care across our country i be sure that ministers would be happy to discuss that with she far 
 the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill introduce to the house yesterday set out to unpick every aspect of the school reform that have lead english school child to rocket up the international league table in english math and science how can the government possibly say that they want to break down barrier to opportunity when they be reverse reform that have transform the life of the most disadvantaged student 
 i do not know which bill the hon lady have be read but it be not the bill that we present to the house yesterday i be determined to drive high and rise standard right across our school system she might be satisfied that in disadvantaged child leave primary school without reach a good standard in english and math but i be not happy about that nor be i happy about the fact that in child be persistently absent from school and   that we inherit a special educational need and disability system in crisis we will turn that around and deliver well life chance for all our child 
 low earn woman be far less likely to have sufficient private pension than their male counterpart be that why the secretary of state decide that governmental responsibility end when work age end 
 the hon lady raise an important point about some of the difference in pension i be more than happy to pick that up with the relevant minister to ensure that she receive a full response

 for year the prime minister and his cabinet play politic with the waspi woman the women against state pension inequality campaign the deputy prime minister say the conservatives be steal their pension she promise to compensate they in full another broken promise now they admit that we be right all along but let we ask about another group of pensioner whose trust be break since the chancellor cut winter fuel payment how many extra people have apply for pension credit 
 the no job of this government be to put the finance back in order after the last government lose control they leave a £ black hole and we have to take tough choice we make sure that the most vulnerable pensioner do get the winter fuel payment and we have be encourage they drive up eligibility for pension credit and people sign up to their entitlement the leader of the opposition should join that campaign here be the difference because we have stabilise the economy we can commit to the triple lock that mean that next april pensioner will get another £ here be the difference week ago the shadow chancellor say that the triple lock be unsustainable their position be that pensioner would lose out under the tories yet again 
 the prime minister do not answer the question because he do not know the answer there be eligible pensioner not claim pension credit if they sign up that will cost the treasury £ wipe out the saving that the chancellor claim she would make before the election the prime minister ’s chief secretary to the treasury tell the   public that labour have no plan to cut winter fuel payment but they do have plan do n’t they age uk say 
 cut the winter fuel payment with very little notice will potentially jeopardise the health as well as the finance of million of old people 
 do the prime minister agree with age uk that this be the last thing that pensioner and the nhs need 
 we have be drive take up with the campaign for pension credit it be important that everyone who be entitle to it claim that pension credit the leader of the opposition should not claim as some great victory that the record of her government be that people have not sign up we be the one with the campaign and the tories should be support it because of the triple lock pension will be go up by £ next april she have not answer the question her shadow chancellor say that the triple lock be unsustainable so she need to explain how pensioner would be bad off under a tory government 
 order it be prime minister ’s question 
 we protect the triple lock during all our time in government meanwhile energy bill be increase despite the prime minister ’s promise to cut they by £ in scotland his party leader want to restore the winter fuel payment across england council be scrabble together fund for struggle pensioner the tragic reality this christmas be that pensioner will suffer and may even die as a result of this cruel policy do the chancellor consider the impact on council and on the nhs or do she just not know what she be do 
 the household support fund be set out in the budget as the leader of the opposition know we be push up pension credit she now say that the conservatives be commit to the triple lock her shadow chancellor say that they be not and that it be unsustainable perhaps over a sandwich or a steak they could sort it out and come back and tell we what their policy actually be 
 the prime minister need to misrepresent i in order to make his point i do not need to misrepresent he in order to make mine the truth be that he do not think this through cut winter fuel payment be not just callous it may not make saving and it could actually cost we all more it be not the only policy that be make thing bad the chancellor ’s budget be a body blow to family business and charity marie curie have warn that labour ’s budget will cost it nearly £ a year that be a cancer charity say that it have no option but to reduce service do the chancellor tell the prime minister that her job tax be go to hit charity 
 the leader of the opposition have ask question about winter fuel—[interruption i will come to that she have change her mind she use to say that the payment be a dead weight she say that she have constituent who do not need they they all stand in on a tory manifesto that commit to get rid of the universal winter fuel payment for pensioner we can see what their real commitment is—[interruption as for the budget we be drive up productivity across—[interruption 
 order i do not want to have to ring the hon gentleman ’s mother 
 we be drive up productivity prosperity and living standard that be a pay rise for the lowest pay the tories should welcome that a pay rise for those work in the nhs and well than expect wage growth just before christmas what unite all be that they be deliver by labour but oppose by the tories 
 i do not know what world the prime minister be live in the economy be shrink and the government do not think this job tax through or who it would impact 
 another area affect be the hospice sector hospice believe that the budget will cost they an extra £ yesterday conservative vote to exempt social care nursery charity and hospice from labour ’s job tax labour vote that down can the prime minister at least agree to fund hospice so that they can continue their invaluable work help people at the end of their life 
 we have put a record amount into the nhs in the budget to deal with the problem that the conservatives leave we will set out the funding arrangement for hospice in the new year but it be the same old same old they want all the benefit from the budget as she have say herself but she do not want to pay for any of they that be what get we into the problem in the place 
 i do not hear a commitment to help hospice which be a shame the truth be that this winter people will be suffer because of the prime minister ’s choice the economy be shrink inflation be go up and job be be lose because of his budget pensioners will be unable to heat their home because of his government ’s decision they raise people ’s hope but then smash they with broken promise and now we learn that he be about to give away our hard win brexit freedoms—[interruption yes the truth be that labour be punch the british people in the face literally in the case of of his mp he will pretend this be about the past but we all know that these be his choice bad choice if he be look for a new year ’s resolution why do he not start with tell the truth 
 i will do it now a £ black hole leave by the conservatives record number on the wait lists—[interruption 
 order it be not a good time to leave the chamber be it 
 a £ black hole record waiting list in our nhs conservative members should hang their head in shame and immigration completely out of control with nearly a net migration the leader of the opposition be the cheerleader for all of that she want the truth that be the truth that be why the conservatives be sit on the opposition benches 
 while conservative members carp from the sideline talk the country down this government be get on with the job record funding for the nhs money for   our train bus and yes pothole pay rise for of the lowest pay wage grow fast than inflation plan law reform and great british energy set up we be only get start next year we will continue to rebuild no matter what the blocker opposite say

 i wish the prime minister a happy christmas i thank he for allow the young carer choir to sing outside no and i hope that he and the staff enjoy it our song be call love be enough but the hard truth be that for many young carer and young adult carer love be not enough these amazing young people need real action to help they with the challenge that they face in addition to the measure that the prime minister just talk about will he support the carers trust ’s young carer covenant to ensure that across local authority we give these young people all the support that they deserve

 this be a serious issue between and there be a month delay in letter to woman bear in 1950 about change to pension age that be unacceptable and it be right that the government apologise in the former chancellor george osborne then accelerate those change with very little notice that equally be unacceptable and labour oppose it at the time interruption it be a serious issue and a complex as the hon gentleman know the research show that of those impact   know about the change that be take place i be afraid to say that the taxpayer simply can not afford the ten of billion of pound in compensation when the evidence show that of those impact know about the change that be because of the state of our economy 
 recent datum show that almost scot have be wait more than year for hospital treatment since their referral the equivalent number in england be around do the prime minister agree that that show the catastrophic damage the snp government have do to the scottish nhs

 since the summer thousand of commuter use harlington and flitwick station have have to put up with nearly of train be cancel in the evening peak while nearly a of train that do arrive be more than minute late be it a mere coincidence that such poor performance follow this government ’s decision to pay off their union backer with no string attach

 i have just set out the factual background and the percentage who know about the change the simple fact of the matter be that in the current economic circumstance the taxpayer can not bear the burden of ten of billion of pound in compensation interruption opposition member be chuntere away but in year they accelerate the change and never once speak about compensation

 labour promise not to raise taxis on work people but farmer be some of the hard work people i know peter douglas from jedburgh have look at the detail of this policy and he say that labour ’s inheritance tax increase will prevent he pass on his family farm to his son and daughter they say labour have betray they and can not trust the prime minister to keep his word they ’ve get a point have n’t they 
 if the hon gentleman would kindly pass the detail of the individual case he have raise to my team we will look into it as he know we put a record £ into farming over the next year in the budget just week ago £ be put in to support farmer that contrast with the £ underspend of the last government on farm in a typical case the threshold be £ which mean that the vast majority of farmer will be unaffected but i will look into the individual case he have raise with i

 last week the royal borough of windsor and maidenhead announce plan to hike council tax by an unprecedented that would require the government ’s permission do the prime minister agree that this outrageous request should be reject that the borough might be a candidate for accelerated local government reorganisation and that my constituent should not be foot the bill for the persistent weak financial control and political failure locally 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that issue on behalf of his constituent we be as he know commit to fix the foundation of local government and keep taxis as low as possible for work people the budget announce a real term increase for local government with over £ of add funding we will put that support in place and he be right to raise that issue 
 we have in our nhs many brilliant émigré and refugee surgeon from the greatly troubled middle east and i have be privileged to work alongside some of they from iran iraq and from syria which we think especially now what practical measure can the uk take to help ensure that syria now have the good chance of become an open society and the functional democracy in the region 
 i thank my hon friend for draw attention to the people of syria and to the health worker of all background who do vital work in our nhs the fall of assad ’s brutal regime be to be welcome and should be welcome but we must be cautious about what come next we have provide £ of extra support to vulnerable syrians and i have speak to g7 leader to work towards a syrian government that respect international law universal human right and protect all citizen across all sector 
 before the election this prime minister say he would lower energy bill by £ since he take office they have go up by £ he say he would protect the winter fuel payment but now he be in power he have strip it off our pensioner and he line up for many photo with waspi woman say he would have their back and he have just betray they in the most scandalous way possible this be now the define characteristic of this trick phony prime minister who say thing and do another in scotland the snp be point ahead in the poll do he understand why the people of these island especially those of we in scotland treat he with such contempt 
 scottish national party member use to ask those question from an area that contain a great many mp not so long ago but all that change   in july now the hon gentleman be carp right up there at the back and we can hardly hear he 
 let i wish you mr speaker all member on both side of the house and especially the house staff a very merry christmas let i also associate myself with those who have thank our emergency service and armed force for their service 
 christmas be a time for peace and good will give that there be more conflict now than at any time since world war and that all war end with a peace what be the prime minister ’s resolution to work with other for a more peaceful world in 
 i be sure that colleague on both side of the house support the value of the international association of parliamentarians for peace with which i know my hon friend be involve and its work to support human right across the globe that i think be the sentiment that we take into this festive period 
 it be good to hear that the prime minister visit british soldier in estonia yesterday before they have to spend christmas away from their family we would all like to see a last peace emerge for ukraine in the new year but putin may take any deal broker by trump as a break in which to re equip and rearm what will the government do to deter russia from restart its imperial war of aggression follow any peace deal 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on his appointment to the intelligence and security committee and thank he for raise the question of our troop in estonia who as he say will be there over christmas without their family they be right on the frontline with a very clear sense of purpose as part of our nato contingent and we thank they the hon gentleman be right to say that we must continue to support ukraine that be the subject of our discussion in estonia yesterday and ensure that it be put in the strong possible position whether in negotiation or not we must also make it absolutely clear that this conflict could be end straight away if the aggressor russia back off 
 i call the mother of the house 
 the waspi woman fight of the most sustained and passionate campaign for justice that i can remember year in year out and we do promise they that we would give they justice i understand the issue of the cost but do the prime minister really understand how let down they feel today 
 i do understand the concern of course i do i have set out the history but the research finding make it clear that of those impact do know about the change in those circumstance the taxpayer simply can not afford the burden of ten of billion of pound of compensation but as i have say i do understand the concern 
 i know that the prime minister be aware of the case of my constituent sara sharif who be brutally torture and appallingly murder by her father and stepmother i want sara ’s legacy to be in which she be the last vulnerable child to be kill by people who should have look after she will the prime minister ensure that an independent inquest and review of sara ’s death be hold at the start of the new year so that we can learn why public authority fail and ensure that it never happen again 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise that absolutely harrowing case it be important that all the lesson be learn an independent process be take place but we must be clear about the need to overhaul child ’s social care to keep young people safe and to look again at the framework for home schooling among other thing we do need to learn those lesson and we be take step there be a process go on at the moment and i will update the house in due course 
 may i thank the prime minister for the leadership that he have show in secure the half a pound deal to secure the future of the hitachi rail factory in my constituency a factory leave in the lurch by the conservative party for year do he agree that what we also need be a long term plan for our proud high tech rail manufacturing to drag it out of the mire that it be leave in by the tories 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the conservatives really should not groan i go up to the hitachi factory early this year before the election the workforce be extremely anxious about the situation because they fear that there would be a gap between contracts—[interruption that gap would have mean that people be go to get lay off and   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart   be chuntere from a sit position unable to understand the impact on work people 
 the workforce be extremely anxious about the situation when i see they because they know that if their colleague be lay off it would be bad for their colleague and their community and it would mean that they might go and get other job and not be able to come back if there be a new contract i say then that i would do everything i could to ensure that we fill that gap and i be very pleased that just the other week we be able to say that we have and that there be a contract i go back up there to speak to the same workforce and they be very pleased that they now do not have those anxiety the conservatives should be ashamed of their chuntering 
 as it be christmas will the prime minister join i in congratulate chris middleton who write a charity song to support age uk that have already raise £ what be even well be that it be likely to beat the leader of the lib dems single to no this year prove yet again that the lib dems can not win something that i hope we can both agree on 
 i be not go to adjudicate between the contend single for the top of the chart but i end this question time by wish a happy christmas and a peaceful new year to everyone across the house 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will provide an update on the negotiation between his majesty ’s government and the government of mauritius over the future sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question we welcome yesterday ’s reiteration by prime minister ramgoolam of his willingness to conclude a deal with the uk we be confident that the agreement be in both side shared interest and we will continue work with the new mauritian government to finalise the deal prime minister ramgoolam ’s comment follow his commitment to complete the negotiation follow his election in an exchange of letter with the prime minister 
 as part of the usual government to government engagement the prime minister ’s biot envoy jonathan powell meet pm ramgoolam in late november to start the process and that be follow last week by a visit to mauritius by the uk ’s chief negotiator harriet mathews and other official for the talk those talk be productive and it be completely understandable that the new mauritian government will want time to study the detail 
 it would not be appropriate or usual for i to give a running commentary on what be discuss during routine and private engagement nor on any potential future engagement i be confident however that we have agree a good and fair deal that be in both side interest it protect the base at proportionate cost it have be support across the national security architecture in the united states and by india for those very reason as i have say a number of time in this house the treaty will contain clear commitment on robust security arrangement include prevent the presence of foreign security force on the outer island and ensure the base can continue to operate securely and effectively 
 the agreement be subject to finalise a treaty follow signature the government will bring forward a bill to enable implementation of that treaty both houses of parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise that treaty before ratification 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker once again minister have be reluctantly drag to the house in fact i have just see the foreign secretary leg it in a world of increase danger change and uncertainty why be they so keen to surrender this strategic asset we have be repeatedly tell by ministers that this be a good deal and that it have the support of the national security apparatus we keep hear that but where be the evidence to justify those hollow claim 
 if the deal be so good why have the government be so secretive about the detail can the minister explain i be sorry that the foreign secretary have abandon the house and not even come to this statement because yet again we be respond to medium report can the minister confirm that we will be able to extend the lease on the military base after year as report will we   and the us still have full autonomy of operation what safeguard will be in place to stop other country include china try to establish themselves on the base or near the military base on diego garcia how much be the british taxpayer go to be liable for each year and in total over year now that we know we will be pay for the privilege of give away these island what exactly be our money go to be pay for 
 the government claim that they can not disclose information about the lease but surely the minister can at least say explain and be honest where on earth the budget be come from if it be account for in the budget forecast present in the autumn we all hear about those budget forecast recently will the minister tell we what the funding will be for the economic partnership and the trust fund for chagossian people can the minister also tell we what aspect of the deal the new mauritian government want reconsider in the response what consideration be be give to provide more funding or to weaken any protection that may be in this lease importantly can he explain why the view of the chagossian community have be so ignore 
 when the whole world can see that this propose deal be fall apart the foreign secretary and this government have try to flog it constantly not only be this a monumental failure of statecraft from this labour government but it be also a significant humiliation for the foreign secretary and his credibility and for the prime minister why be labour put our security at risk ignore chagossian and let our standing go into freefall in this world 
 i remind member that these contribution should take no long than minute 
 we be absolutely not damage our security we be protect it through this deal and that be why this deal have be agree to protect the operation of that base to protect it against the legal uncertainty and to ensure it be on a safe footing well into the next century 
 the right hon lady constantly refer to our somehow give up the base on diego garcia but the deal do exactly the opposite—[interruption it protect the base on diego garcia interruption it protect the base to continue operating—[interruption 
 order mr gemmell we have enough all the way through prime minister ’s question if i hear any more you be out i seriously mean that i be not put up with it 
 the right hon lady constantly talk as if somehow we be give up the base on diego garcia that be the exact opposite of what this deal do unlike the failure to secure the deal under the last administration which i might remind the house go through round of negotiation yet fail to secure a deal to protect our base this deal protect the base 
 the right hon lady ask a series of other question she ask whether we would be able to extend the lease and the answer be yes would we continue to have autonomy for our operation and those of our ally absolutely yes be there safeguard in place to prevent foreign force or other on the outer island absolutely yes 
 i have answer the question on cost a number of time in the house we be very clear that it be not normal practice for the united kingdom to confirm the value of its payment for military basis anywhere across the globe we have not do that in the case of any other base such as the in oman and the united states itself have not confirm the value of its direct payment for basis include in djibouti and the marshall islands 
 the right hon lady speak about the chagossians and have engage with chagossian community over many year i be confident that this deal have clear benefit for chagossian community and will allow the resettlement of the outer island and the restarting of visit she also mention the trust fund 
 the right hon lady refer to medium report and there be a huge amount of speculation let we get back to the actual fact the mauritian prime minister himself have confirm to his assembly that he be willing to conclude this deal with the united kingdom those be the fact and we will protect our national security and our interest 
 under the mauritian criminal code anyone who question the integrity of mauritian territory include the chagos archipelago be potentially subject to year imprisonment most british chagossians have at time or another effectively give that level of disconsideration to the mauritian government what conversation have the minister have with the mauritian government to ensure that this part of the code be remove so that it be possible for british chagossians to visit chagos in the event that the deal go through 
 as i say we take the interest of chagossian community incredibly seriously the deal provide for chagossian to return to the outer island and to resettle they if mauritius decide to pursue a programme of resettlement most importantly we will get on with get those visit go so that they can go back and visit the island include diego garcia with the appropriate protection in place 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the foreign secretary tell this house on   october   that his deal be in the uk ’s security interest the chaos we have see since then do nothing to assure our ally or to repel our enemy in retrospect do the minister think it be wise to announce an agreement just week before election in mauritius and the us do he agree it would be wise for any future agreement to come before this house for scrutiny and a vote before signature 
 it be important that any agreement comply with the opinion of the international court of justice but self determination remain an important principle too now that negotiation have reopen can the minister say how the chagossian people will be represent in those talk 
 a court rule this week that tamil asylum seeker be illegally detain in terrible condition on diego garcia will the minister apologise for their treatment   and assure the house that the camp in which they be hold be now close for good 
 as i have repeatedly say in this house the interest of the chagossians have be absolutely at the heart of this deal and i be sure they will be confident that there be a number of provision that will satisfy the concern that member be raise in good faith and that chagossians have raise with i directly this be a treaty negotiation between the united kingdom and mauritius the hon gentleman be aware of the icj judgment and i will let he read that in his own time 
 the hon gentleman specifically ask about the situation of the migrant and we recognise and be carefully consider this week ’s judgment but i make it clear that this government inherit a deeply troubling situation that remain unresolved under the last administration year after the migrant arrival on diego garcia i believe that the shadow foreign secretary be home secretary when the migrant arrive and the situation go unresolved we be absolutely clear that the situation be unsustainable and we work at pace to resolve it we will carefully consider the judgment of that court 
 those of we who have speak to the american military know the importance of this base will the minister confirm that he say that since the agreement be announce the american military and security service have raise no concern with this government 
 yes indeed as far as i be aware that be the case in fact the opposite be true there have be a warm welcome for this agreement from across the united states security apparatus because it put this base and our share operation on a secure footing into the future i remind the house again that that be the very reason why this government act and indeed why the previous foreign secretary start the process in the place so we be tell 
 let ’s go over to james cleverly then 
 will the minister answer this with a simple yes or no do the prime minister   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer have any conversation with philippe sands kc about diego garcia without the presence of foreign office or other government civil servant yes or no 
 i do not have detail of all the prime minister ’s meeting i be sure the right hon gentleman can ask the prime minister that question himself 
 for those of we who have serve for the us military who retain genuine and close link with the us military and who know that this issue do not bring about the concern that other be try to conflate with it will the minister say what his view be on how it be see by our us military friend 
 i praise my hon friend for his service and work i be very clear our ally in the united states and indeed our other ally who rely on    the important guarantee that the base provide be supportive of the deal it have be support across the security apparatus at every level and that be absolutely crucial we would not have sign up to a deal if it do not protect our interest and those of our close ally 
 i call the father of the house 
 can the minister enlighten we as to the attitude on the deal of the incoming trump administration do he know or shall i ask   the hon member for clacton nigel farage 
 we very much welcome as i have say before the election of president elect trump and vice president elect vance during the transition period there be restriction on what conversation can go on as i have say repeatedly in the house we be confident that when the full detail of the deal be provide by the us national security apparatus any concern will be allay 
 i know that the minister be a strong supporter of the overseas territory as be the foreign secretary and the prime minister despite this be document already in the house and in gibraltar to avoid any doubt or further scaremongering and for member on the opposition benches will the minister once again confirm that this government be completely committed to support the right of self determination for the people of gibraltar and the falklands 
 i thank my hon friend for her important work on gibraltar as i thank you for your mr speaker i have say this before and i will confirm again that we be absolutely and resolutely commit to the sovereignty and self determination of gibraltar and the falkland islands indeed i enjoy meet our overseas territory family at the joint ministerial council just a few week ago 
 it be truly baffle that such decent ministers have allow themselves to be bamboozle by the blob will the minister confirm that this be not be rush through in advance of the takeover of the white house by an incoming president in month ’s time if in month ’s time that new president say that this be a terrible deal will it be too late to change it 
 the right hon gentleman know that i have immense respect for he and his work in this house i take issue with his choice of word we have incredible official in this government who have loyally serve government from party on both side of this house they work incredibly hard to defend the national security and interest of this country if anything this be not rush at all there be round of negotiation under the government of the right hon gentleman ’s party we get in and we get a deal do that protect our national security and our interest 
 what assurance can the minister provide parliament about the scrutiny that the agreement which will be strike in due course will receive 
 as i have say a number of time in the house the treaty once sign will go through the normal procedure in the house i confirm that in my answer to   the right hon member for witham priti patel there will be the opportunity for ample scrutiny by both houses and legislation will be lay in due course 
 the minister get ahead of himself he say the government have move at pace to resolve the situation the situation be not resolve he criticise the last government for not secure a deal his deal be not secure either the last time we talk about this we talk about the president elect not be keen on the deal and the chagossians not be properly consult on it when will he come back to the house on this situation and tell we something positive about this cack handed deal 
 i have repeatedly state a number of positive thing include the support for chagossians that will be inherent in the deal the positive fact be that after round of fail negotiation under the previous government we achieve and have do a deal we be confident that that deal will be support by our partner and we will continue to present detail of it in due course 
 do the minister agree that confirm the legal status of the base which be leave outstanding by the previous government will cement our role in the indo pacific and provide an important pillar in our strategy to counter chinese influence in the area 
 my hon friend be absolutely right despite the attempt to constantly whip up the idea about chinese influence the deal contain specific precaution to prevent foreign force i remind the house again that mauritius be of the only country that do not join the belt and road initiative its ally be india not china 
 the government clearly want to dismantle legacy of empire why then do we think it be so important to attach the chagos island to mauritius when in fact that link be only establish when both territory be acquire by the french empire and later by the british empire why do we not listen to the chagossians instead of impose the legacy of empire on they 
 i have engage with many chagossian group the hon member will know as i have say multiple time that there be a range of view across the chagossian community he be perfectly able to look at the legal judgment himself the fact be that the government want to secure the long term operation of the base our national security and our interest we have engage with our partner and secure a deal which his government fail to do 
 the current situation be clearly unsustainable most of the negotiation take place under the previous administration it be now become a political football have the minister hear any other serious recommendation for the future of the island 
 no i have not and i certainly have not hear they from the opposition benches 
 i will repeat the question ask by my hon friend   the member for bicester and woodstock calum miller which the minister studiously avoid clearly the deal be not ready to be sign so why be it announce week before the election 
 when we be look to protect the national security of this country we will operate at the fast and most appropriate pace that we can this matter have be leave languish under the previous administration with the future of the base unsecure we have secure it 
 may i wish you a merry christmas mr speaker 
 do the minister recognise that the issue be be raise by the opposition again and again despite the cognitive dissonance that it be they who open the negotiation in the place i have to endorse the comment of my hon friend   the member for portsmouth north amanda martin   about the scaremongering and the irresponsible way in which the opposition have conduct the debate with regard to other overseas territory and self determination 
 order i be a little bit concerned as i grant the urgent question i have take a judgment call i hope we be not question that 
 it be absolutely right that the house scrutinise these matter and it will continue to have the opportunity to do so in a range of forum indeed i will meet parliamentarian later today to discuss they there appear to be collective amnesia among conservative members i have raise this a number of time many of they serve as ministers in the previous government and they know exactly what the risk be to our national security 
 i have just return hotfoot from a very full mar a lago i speak to several member senior administrator especially of the incoming administration which will be in the white house in day time let i assure you that there be very deep disquiet among they all as to what this deal may mean for the long term future of diego garcia and whether such a deal will hold give the precedent of the deal break over hong kong they also can not understand why we would surrender the sovereignty of the island on an advisory judgment from a pretty obscure court this be about sovereignty and you keep say yourself that the sovereignty 
 order we can not both stand when you say you you mean i i have no ownership of this decision 
 that be fair enough mr speaker if we respect the sovereignty of gibraltar and the falkland islands on the basis that it be what the people want can we have a referendum of all the eligible chagossian and let they decide the future sovereignty of the chagos island that surely be the only fair solution 
 we have be very clear that these negotiation be between the united kingdom and mauritius and i have set out in the past the reason for that the interest of the chagossians be absolutely at the heart of this agreement and as i have say i have repeatedly engage with they the hon gentleman continue to speculate but with the great of respect he do not know the detail of what have be agree he do not know the detail of what have be share and he do not know the detail that the national security apparatus of the united states have consider i be confident that his concern will be allay once he see the detail of this deal 
 merry christmas mr speaker the minister say that view across the chagossian community be mixed in my experience mr speaker when politician say that they be simply choose the view that they want to hear will the minister take the opportunity that have be give by the incoming mauritian government to take a breathing space in which he can consult formally and in a structured way with the chagossians to find out what they want 
 i have engage with the chagossian community twice in recent month as i have make clear in answer to a number of parliamentary question table by the right hon gentleman ’s colleague the interest of the chagossians will continue to be at the heart of this agreement and i take their concern very seriously i be be quite honest mr speaker that there be a range of view some oppose the deal and some be in favour of it that be completely natural in a democratic process 
 let we go to a long term campaigner jeremy corbyn 
 thank you mr speaker have be a member of the chagos islands british indian ocean territory all party parliamentary group ever since it be found and have a lot of interaction with chagossians over the past year i can assure the minister that i have meet many chagossian in this country and in mauritius they be abominably treat and short change by the deal of and then later remove from the island their unifying cause be the right of return and settlement and i hope the minister will confirm that that right will be uphold i understand all the negotiation surround the base but there be no reason why they should not include the right of at least visit if not reside on diego garcia itself 
 the international court of justice be very clear that the decolonisation process be not properly carry out by britain in the 1960 when mauritius achieve its independence and that have to be make right that have be vote on by the icj vote on by the un general assembly and endorse by the security council be any more evidence necessary to indicate that it be clearly part of mauritius and that chagossians have right within mauritius as well as on the chagos islands where hopefully they will be able to return 
 i agree with the right hon member ’s characterisation of what happen to the chagossians in the past it be a matter of deep regret for this government   and indeed i think that regret be share across the house as i have say we will have the interest of the chagossians at the heart of this agreement he be right to characterise the range of view across the chagossian community in response to the question that have just be put to i i can confirm that the programme of visit will include the ability to visit all the island include diego garcia with the appropriate safeguard in place i hope too for a resettlement of the outer island a provision certainly exist for that to happen and i think that that be of the most likely scenario in which chagossians can finally return to those outer island 
 the minister be try to say that nothing have change on this deal yet medium report suggest that the new prime minister of mauritius believe that the deal be not good enough and the minister be now say that it be the same deal clearly there be something that we be not be tell in this house either the amount of money that we be pay for the rental of the space will have to increase or some term and condition have change thank you mr speaker for ensure that this house can scrutinise the position the minister should have give a statement to that effect rather than have to have an urgent question can we therefore pause this process to allow the chagossians to have their say and to look at what the incoming american government have to say and then before we proceed with this giveaway make sure that everyone be in agreement 
 the prime minister of mauritius have make it very clear in his exchange of letter with the prime minister of this country and also in his statement yesterday that they be willing to conclude an agreement with we that be very clear therefore on the fundamental nothing have change we be engage in conversation it be only natural that after an election they would want to do that and to be able to scrutinise the agreement that be entirely proper that be why official have be have these conversation but i will not give a running commentary on private discussion 
 i know the minister will want to give the house the great possible clarity on what have bring we to this point the foreign secretary have be clear that of the central consideration for the government be the likelihood if not the inevitability of a bind legal judgment against the uk in this matter the minister will know that the judgment of the international court of justice be not bind on the united kingdom when dispute be between the uk and another state which be or be a member of the commonwealth that would include mauritius i do not expect the minister to disclose the legal advice that the government have receive but will he please give the house some more clarity about the nature of the legal jeopardy that the government perceive here 
 i will not for that very reason go into that type of advice the right hon and learn member know that from his extensive and distinguished experience on these matter i have to ask this fundamental question if there be not a problem why do his government start negotiation on this 
 i think we can forgive our overseas territory for be a little concerned about this government ’s commitment to their right to self determination those of we who like i be a bit old and have long memory will remember when the previous labour government open negotiation with the spanish government over the future of gibraltar but what i be more interested in today be have reassurance from the minister that any decision will be well inform so can he say which of his ministers have visit the british indian ocean territory 
 i like the right hon lady but i have to say that i find it extremely unhelpful the way that the falklands gibraltar and other overseas territory which be not comparable with this situation be constantly bring up i have just be with the leader at the joint ministerial council mr speaker you graciously host a reception as well and we be absolutely resolute in our commitment to the falklands and gibraltar i have be there and say it myself directly on the rock the minister of state for the armed forces have just be in the falklands say exactly the same thing to the falkland islanders i can tell you mr speaker they be get feed up with the nonsense that we be hear about this it be hugely problematic for their interest go forward 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests surely the minister must accept though that the timing of this announcement be of the big diplomatic gaffe of modern time it come literally hour before a general election be call there be a widespread perception in mauritius that this government be try to give a leg up to a very unpopular sit government who subsequently score out of directly elect seat in the mauritian parliament do he not agree that it be wholly appropriate that the new labour mauritian government would be wary of the intention of his government 
 i simply do not recognise the right hon member ’s characterisation 
 can the minister update the house on the measure be take to safeguard against the emergence of chinese military and surveillance capability in the british indian ocean territory 
 i have be very clear that within the agreement there be provision to ensure the security of the outer island this deal would not have be agree by the united states security apparatus or indeed by we be it to give that kind of benefit to another country i have be very clear about the position of mauritius in relation to china and there be provision and safeguard in place that should allay any fear on that matter 
 the minister do not seem to answer the question raise by the shadow foreign secretary so may i ask this just more time from which budget do the government plan to make the annual payment that he be propose to the mauritian government 
 i have be very very clear—[laughter conservative members can guffaw all they like but i will give the answer that relate to the fact here and that relate to the national security interest of this country the previous government be involve in round of negotiation and they fail to achieve a deal we achieve that deal we will provide further detail in due course 
 yet again this new labour government rush into an ill judge and regrettable policy decision to cede the british indian ocean territory to mauritius against expert advice and with no regard to the wish of chagossians in this country and elsewhere it be like the government ’s awful policy on scrap the winter fuel payment for pensioner the heartless family farm tax and their job tax will the government show some leadership admit that they have get this wrong scrap the deal and keep this vital territory under british control to protect uk interest the marine environment and ultimately global security in an increasingly unstable and dangerous world 
 i gently suggest that the hon gentleman spend a bit more time reflect on the failure of his administration on this and a series of other issue from the public finance to our national security this government be clear up the mess that his party leave behind on not only this issue but so many other 
 i thank the minister for his answer however i be a sponsor of the british indian ocean territory citizenship bill which call for descendant bear to individual within the british indian ocean territory to be able to register as biot there be now an even great imperative because of the chagos decision which be make with no input from local people what discussion will take place with those who consider themselves british the chagossians seem not to be assure so what will be do to ensure that they receive all the necessary information in a timely manner and will not get answer to their question through news medium outlet 
 i have a deep respect for the hon gentleman as i have say a number of time the government deeply regret the way that chagossians be remove from the island and treat thereafter we have always be clear on respect the interest of chagossian community i have engage and will continue to engage with chagossian community their interest be at the heart of the deal from the trust fund to the ability to resettle on and visit the island and a series of other measure that we have take here in the united kingdom i be confident that their interest be be respect 
 the government be elect on a mandate of change to deliver a new era of economic growth and national renewal and reverse the year of failure and decline that we inherit through the tough decision that we take in the budget we prevent a return to austerity while protect work people ’s payslip the plan for change that the prime minister unveil early this month be the next stage on the journey of reform a plan to kick start growth and get britain build again put more money in people ’s pocket and deliver new home good job and opportunity for all 
 just this week we announce our plan to rebuild and reform local government and to empower local leader to deliver that change so that the benefit be feel in every community we can not do this alone we need strong empower local government to work with we as equal partner in a new relationship public service be our collective duty but after a decade of cut fiscal mismanagement and the failure of the previous government to fix the foundation it be a fact that council of all political stripe be in crisis the broken local audit system in england and the scandal of the unacceptable backlog that lead to the recent whole of government account disclaimer far illustrate the dire strait of the system and the legacy that we must reconcile 
 the prime minister get this as a former director of a critical public service he know that reform be vital and so do the deputy prime minister have work on the frontline as a home care worker see the human impact every single day i be proud to have public service and local government in my blood too that be why i take the responsibility to lead the government ’s work to rebuild the sector with the seriousness that be due and the urgency that be require the work have already begin and today mark a major milestone in our mission to rebuild local government and put council on a firm financial footing as we publish the provisional local government finance settlement for and launch our consultation on these proposal alongside our consultation on wide funding reform 
 in the autumn budget the government announce £ of additional funding for local government service of which £ would come in the settlement present today but we know that we need to rally that be why i be announce over £ of additional grant that include over £ of extra funding for social care since the policy statement i also confirm that the new funding include £ that will be make available in the final settlement to support council with the increase in employer national insurance contribution the package in the provisional settlement will enable local government to invest in the vital service that people rely on make £ available equivalent to a real term increase in council core spending power when compare with i confirm that this will increase even far in the final settlement 
 today be the start not the end take together the additional funding make available in this settlement and the budget will deliver over £ of new   funding for local service over and above local council tax alongside that every authority in england will receive a off share of £ currently hold in the business rate levy account
