the secretary of state be ask 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on food supply chain in scotland 
 this government want to ensure that farmer and food producer get a fair price for their product by tackle unfairness that exist in food supply chain we be currently pursue contractual reform in the dairy and pork sector and we have a new review of the egg sector this will ensure resilience and fair supply chain across the country 
 my constituent in edinburgh west like so many other across the country be find it increasingly difficult to source affordable nutritious food the situation have be make bad by flood in scotland and by international pressure such as the war in ukraine energy price and brexit there be enterprise such as lauriston farm in my community that can provide good local food what be the government do to support project such as those and to offset the impact on our food producer of the recent flooding 
 i recognise the point that the hon lady make about the pressure on the food supply chain the uk government be closely monitor the impact on the agricultural sector of the flooding cause by storm and we be work with the environment agency to resolve that the department for environment food and rural affairs can provide financial assistance to the farming sector to cover uninsurable loss incur as a result of exceptional flooding by activate the farming recovery fund i would encourage the hon lady to contact the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore the excellent new water minister at defra for more information 
 i now come to the shadow minister and welcome he to his position 
 thank you mr speaker it be a pleasure to be here although i have to say that there be not particularly stiff competition for the role from scotland 
 inflation might be slowly come down but food inflation in scotland still stand at more than force family to choose between be able to eat or heat their home or give the increase level of destitution neither thousand of people in scotland be turn to food bank not as a off last resort but as a means of get by week after week it be clear that both our government should be work together much well to tackle this so what specific step will the minister take to work with the scottish government and the food industry to ensure that food price do not continue to rise at unaffordable rate do he really believe that the autumn statement will give family any confidence that the government understand how difficult it be for people in scotland right now 
 i welcome the hon member to his new position i recognise the point he make about stiff competition but nonetheless i very much welcome he 
 this government be absolutely committed to tackle the rise price that household be face which be why the prime minister have an absolute focus on reduce the level of inflation but the hon member be right to say that both government should be work together to alleviate pressure on household budget this government have demonstrate that through the huge support that have be put in place to support household with energy price and through other measure to ensure that financial help be in place to support hard press household 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of post office branch closure on the delivery of government service in scotland 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of post office branch closure on the delivery of government service in scotland 
 the united kingdom government continue to provide significant support to the national post office network add up to more than £ over the last year this funding enable of individual in rural area to live within mile of their near post office in with the overall network as large today as it have be for year 
 our rural branch of the post office be at the very core the very heart of our rural community at present his majesty ’s government provide certain service to the public via the post office network do the minister agree that it would be a good notion to encourage the scottish government to go down the same route and provide as many service as possible in that way thus ensure the future of those branch 
 i agree with the hon member i recognise the vital importance of post office for constituent in rural community such as his own and also in my own constituency in the scottish borders it be of course for the scottish government to assess how to make their service available to people across scotland consider   accessibility as well as value for money for the taxpayer however i would be happy to facilitate a meeting with my colleague in the department for business and trade to see what further encouragement we could give the scottish government to use the post office network for the delivery of their service 
 scotland have see the closure of post office in the past year yet as   the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone   point out the community that still have post office be lose access to government service particularly in rural area driver and vehicle licensing agency service be due to cease be available at post office from the end of next march what conversation have the minister have with the department for business and trade about keep dvla service available from post office 
 i should start by correct the hon gentleman in that the post office network be not in decline more post office have be open than close over the past year we do see fluctuation in different part of the country with many postmaster run a franchise business in their own right many face the same challenge as other high street business the dvla and the post office extend their contract until   march the post office network operate commercially at arm ’s length from the government and be responsible for take decision on commercial matter such as the dvla contract 
 what assessment he have make of the state of devolution in scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the state of devolution in scotland 
 with devolved power the scottish government can tailor policy in area such as health education and justice as well as in tax and welfare through additional power in the scotland act the uk government be work with local government and local partner to deliver on their need and wish that be real devolution in action 
 climate change talk at cop28 begin tomorrow and of the most important issue to be agree be the climate loss and damage fund the secretary of state will know that scotland have lead the way on that become the country in the global north to pledge financial support to address loss and damage but he and his conservative colleague be intent on limit the scottish government ’s international engagement can he tell i why he want to silence scotland ’s voice and prevent we from provide that global leadership 
 it be very straightforward we understand that there will be environmental engagement overseas by the scottish government and that be a devolved matter what we have try get a grip on be the scottish government travel overseas meet ministers   discuss reserved area such as constitutional affair and foreign affair and stray away from the portfolio of matter that be devolve to they that be our position 
 it be obvious that in order to cement a sense of economic resilience scotland require a population growth strategy but the devolution settlement unfit as it be will not come anywhere near that and the government continue to set their face against it can the secretary of state explain why 
 if the scottish government want more people to settle in scotland and immigration be at a record high they need to build more housing have low taxis and well public service and make scotland more attractive to people 
 do my right hon friend share my disappointment that the snp green scottish government continue to use the devolution settlement as a platform to pursue constitutional grievance in reality would not achieve the good outcome for the people of scotland and our constituent mean the government work together on a project for example the a75 if the government work together that will actually be deliver 
 i absolutely agree with my right hon friend the a75 along with the a77 come up as a vital route in the union connectivity review by lord hendy of richmond hill sir peter hendy as he be at the time we be finally work with the scottish government and the uk government be fund a feasibility study for the upgrade of the a75 i be delighted that progress be be make 
 be it not the case that the scottish government have consistently stray outside the limit of the devolution settlement so it be very difficult to take the snp seriously as a defender of devolution when it have so little respect for the current settlement 
 my hon friend be right everyone forget that the scottish government get up every day and go to work to destroy devolution and the united kingdom the defender of devolution and the strengthener of the united kingdom be this government 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 let i take this opportunity to congratulate my hon friend   the member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks   not only on his vast and fast promotion to the shadow front bench but on the swing from the snp that bring he the by election victory 
 the announcement of the closure of the refinery at grangemouth be a hammer blow too many community be still live with the devastation of be leave behind after coalmine closure in the 1980s that must not be allow to happen again grangemouth ’s owner be buy football club and invest in plant elsewhere while the worker lose out the prime minister have decide that a culture war on the environment trump get the uk into the global green energy race by back   labour ’s green energy superpower plan the devolution settlement demand that both government work together but they certainly do not what discussion be the secretary of state have with the scottish government to protect job at grangemouth what impact will the closure have on the acorn carbon capture and storage project 
 of all it be a very worrying time for those whose job be at risk at the grangemouth refinery this morning the under secretary of state for scotland my hon friend   the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont and a minister from the department for energy security and net meet neil gray from the scottish government and yesterday my hon friend have a meeting with the local authority work be go on it be ironic that the scottish government want to shut down oil and gas because when that happen people suddenly realise the need to manage a transition and take we gradually to net while protect people ’s livelihood 
 on acorn and the scottish cluster i have speak to the chief executive of storegga which be pull the project together he tell i that the refinery closing have little impact on its project because grangemouth be supply the blue hydrogen to the refinery and other and the emission from that be be put into the north sea 
 it be the anniversary of the scottish parliament next year of the labour party ’s proud achievement however recently it have be rive by failure and scandal from in on nhs waiting list to ferry ipad and camper van much have be make about the dual role of the government appoint lord advocate who sit in the scottish cabinet while preside over prosecution in scotland what discussion have the secretary of state have with the scottish government about anas sarwar ’s idea to split the dual role of scotland ’s top law officer to maintain the separation of power between the government and the judiciary 
 as the hon gentleman will know the director of public prosecutions in england be appoint by a panel which remove the risk of perceive interference by government many learn friend have express their concern to i about the structure in scotland and the closeness between the judiciary and the government and i find their concern understandable it be vital that the public perception be that the prosecution service be very independent from government 
 i call the chair of the scottish affairs committee 
 i be sure the secretary of state will agree that his mission to constrain and bypass the scottish parliament have be an absolute disaster for devolution relationship across the uk have never be as such a low level will he acknowledge that his version of aggressive unionism have utterly fail as he be leave his office will he pledge to abandon it entirely 
 i be not entirely sure what i have do that have be a failure to be honest this government protect devolution and the settlement if he be refer to the section order that i use that be in the   scotland act and be vote for at the time by snp mps it be there to protect devolution when a devolve administration legislate on great britain or uk matter 
 if he will have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of devolve employment law to the scottish government 
 the uk government have no intention of devolve legislative competence for employment right to the scottish parliament employer and employee benefit hugely from a single simple system where employment right be the same across great britain whether in derby or dundee we do not see any benefit from change that arrangement 
 devolution of employment law be support by the scottish trades union congress the trades union congress worker right group a majority in the scottish parliament and the public it would benefit worker by have their government compete to give they well right and prevent a race to the bottom what be not to like why will the secretary of state ’s government not consider it 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my original answer we believe it be right to have a simple system that work across the united kingdom whether be in derby or dundee 
 do the secretary of state agree that to have different employment law either side of the border of the nation would be a mistake because it would increase the regulatory burden on company and deprive british company of our excellent tribunal system 
 i completely agree with my right hon and learn friend who absolutely make the right argument 
 if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce a scottish work visa scheme to the scottish government 
 if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce a scottish work visa scheme to the scottish government 
 if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce a scottish work visa scheme to the scottish government 
 the united kingdom government have introduce a single flexible immigration system that work in the interest of the whole united kingdom a separate visa system would create an economic migration border   between scotland and the rest of the uk which would be harmful for employer and far less attractive for worker 
 last week the cbi conference raise the serious issue of a lack of people to do vital job that we need filling especially in hospitality and food production both the fraser of allander institute and the highlands msp kate forbes have suggest localise worker visa solution to boost the economy why be the secretary of state not listen to those smart voice and why be he not act in the good interest of the scottish economy 
 because we have a specific scottish occupation list for shortage which give we flexibility the salary rate be set at £ we believe that the good way be for stakeholder body to make representation to the home office to add to the shortage occupation list 
 year ago the migration advisory committee say that the current system be fail remote community recently publish figure show that my argyll and bute constituency be suffer further depopulation with the town of rothesay on the isle of bute particularly badly affected despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary the government still insist that the current system deliver for all part of the uk will the secretary of state explain how a size fit all policy simultaneous catering for the vastly different need of densely populate urban area and argyll and bute can deliver equally for both 
 argyll and bute be a beautiful part of the united kingdom but what it lack be infrastructure public service and affordable housing because the scottish government have fail in all those area what it also have with the rest of scotland be the problem of be the highest tax part of the united kingdom that be the problem the scottish government have to address 
 the uk government say that post brexit domestic employment would fill labour gap but the executive director of ukhospitality scotland have say that the gap leave by exclude eu worker have not be fill leave huge number of specialist vacancy such as for chef and manager when will this government accept reality and stop destroy scotland ’s economy in the name of a purist brexit ideology 
 i think the hon lady live in a parallel universe we have the high net migration to the uk since record begin far high than when we be in the eu as i say if we want to attract people to scotland we must stop make it the highest tax part of the united kingdom 
 the secretary of state have correctly identify that there be some who want to use immigration policy to enforce a hard border between england and scotland as part of their aim to break up the union do he agree and in his assessment do he identify that we need to ensure that immigration policy be not use as an alternative to offer the rewarding package that key worker deserve 
 absolutely we be united kingdom we have no physical border it be important that we treat immigration equally across the whole united kingdom and give everyone equal opportunity 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 let i be clear we be talk about the administration of work permit for people from overseas who wish to work in scotland on a temporary basis just about everyone think it would be well administer in scotland but the secretary of state insist that it should be centralise by his government in westminster his argument would be plausible if the uk demonstrate that it be manage the migration service well but give the catastrophe that be the uk immigration system when will he wake up and realise this would be well do in scotland by the people who live there 
 i point the hon gentleman to the seasonal agricultural worker scheme that be people with the ability to flex it up to those people come to work in a flexible system across the united kingdom and it have prove to be a huge success 
 the secretary of state be stand against everyone he be stand against expert against academic against representative of industry and even against the people of scotland only of whom think immigration be too high more than in think more immigration would benefit the country when be he go to stop be the secretary of state against scotland and be the secretary of state for scotland 
 it be good that the hon gentleman ’s line be write by mike russell that be an old and not a very good 
 the reality be that scotland be the most tax part of the united kingdom which be not attractive for people to work there we have the high ever net migration if the scottish government focus more on good public service good infrastructure and low taxation hopefully those high net migration figure will see more people settle in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on develop carbon capture utilisation and storage in scotland 
 carbon capture utilisation and storage be a vital component of our journey to net the acorn project represent a huge opportunity for the north east of scotland as would be expect for any multi pound project due diligence must now be follow 
 under westminster rule bathgate linwood methil and irvine be all no more grangemouth now risk be add to that sorry list and with it the hope of its develop carbon technology the minister be quick to attack a scottish government with limited power but responsibility for the robbery and ruination   of scotland ’s energy sector and the continued denial of substantial funding for carbon capture rest squarely with the uk government what be his office do to protect energy sector job and livelihood in scotland and what be his department ’s excuse for utterly fail the people of scotland 
 i have the pleasure of meet the cabinet secretary from the scottish government this morning together with the leader of falkirk council to discuss the situation at grangemouth the scottish government and the uk government be work together hand in hand to protect as many job as possible the scottish cluster be expect to include at least project locate in grangemouth which be welcome news 
 whether his department have have recent discussion with the scottish government on support productive forestry planting in scotland 
 i very much welcome this question which be timely in national tree week reforestation be a crucial way for we all to reduce carbon emission and improve biodiversity across the country although this policy be devolve the uk government continue to work with the devolved administrations to deliver uk wide change in tree planting and establishment 
 conifer which be the main specie plant for productive forestry account for just under half the area of uk woodland do my hon friend agree that there should now be a uk wide target for of new planting to be productive forestry allow scotland to lead the way in deliver a secure supply of raw material to support british manufacturing and construction 
 i thank my hon friend for her excellent question there be high ambition across the united kingdom to increase forestry planting i agree that we must secure a steady supply of the raw material need to support britain ’s construction and manufacturing industry 
 last week—[interruption i do not normally get such a cheer 
 last week the government announce that there will be a new national park and a new national forest in england do the scottish government or the minister have any intention of do something similar for scotland 
 there be great ambition for an additional national park in scotland and my scottish conservative colleague be push very hard for that if the hon gentleman need more information he should please write to i i will respond with the require detail 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on promote scotland ’s interest abroad 
 the uk government work tirelessly to promote scottish interest around the world through our extensive diplomatic network forge business link and generate trade and investment our response to the scottish affairs committee ’s recent inquiry on scotland ’s international promotion highlight the extensive effort we undertake to achieve this 
 as of the prime minister ’s trade envoy it be always my pleasure to be champion british business overseas from whisky to satellite scotland be home to some of the uk ’s most important export will my right hon friend update the house on what work the scotland office be do to support these important sector in the international market 
 i thank my hon friend for his service as a trade envoy and tell he that last month i have the pleasure of travel to vietnam to boost scotland ’s trade interest and celebrate diplomatic link vietnam already offer huge opportunity for scottish business and in the light of the uk ’s recent joining of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership that be easy for you to say mr speaker i be keen to highlight further trading opportunity for scottish business in the indo pacific region 
 for the final question i call patrick grady 
 will the secretary of state clarify what he be say early and whether he think it be legitimate for scottish government ministers to be able to travel overseas to promote the work of the scottish government 
 i have always be very clear that scottish government ministers can go overseas to promote area that be devolve but the reserved area such as the constitution and foreign affair be a matter for the uk government and those ministers should not be use our embassy and consulate to promote their plan for separation or their different view on the middle east or anything else 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question let i remind member of an important courtesy that we should all observe give notice to colleague if we be visit their constituency on official business colleague in lancashire ought to think about that when they be go to other constituency and let people know when they be do so i believe that do not happen on this occasion i have hear of a number of example in other area of this discourteous way of behave towards colleague which be not acceptable i would rather we do not have to deal with such matter by point of order so please try to give notice before visit each other ’s constituency 
 i also say to everybody that temperate and moderate language be what i want in this chamber let we now move on to pmq 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday november 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have other such meeting later today 
 last year scotland export wh of electricity worth £ to the uk grid yet not only do scottish generator pay the high grid connection charge in europe but scot pay among the high standing charge while london ’s be by far the low our heating and lighting be switch on a lot early and off a lot later than the south of england ’s should scottish household be force to shiver in the dark this winter to subsidise the rich part of the uk 
 as the hon gentleman will know stand charge be a matter for ofgem the independent regulator last week it launch a consultation ask for view about standing charge he will know that because of geographic factor the uk government already provide an annual cross subsidy worth £ to a typical household in scotland but on top of that we be provide considerable support to everyone across the uk with their energy bill this year 
 abigail mor edan be year old release from hamas captivity last weekend abigail be an orphan after her parent be brutally execute in front of she during hamas ’s rampage on october to secure the freedom of abigail and some other hostage israel be take a huge risk release convict terrorist include would be suicide bomber israa jaabis imprison for detonate a gas cylinder in her car in hamas also seem to have break the ceasefire by activate explosive device what step be my right hon friend the prime minister take to continue his welcome steadfast support for israel in its fight against not only hamas but other iran back terror group 
 i thank my hon friend for raise such an important issue my thought and the thought of the whole house will be with abigail 
 as i have say before we support israel ’s right to defend itself to go after hamas and to free hostage to deter further incursion and to strengthen its security for the long term we welcome the extension to the agreement to pause fighting increase humanitarian aid and release further hostage negotiation be ongoing and highly sensitive but this have be a welcome positive step we will continue to hold iran to account for any further escalation from these group as well as continue to work with partner to disrupt and deter iran ’s destabilising activity in the middle east 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 in an effort to hide from his failure the prime minister spend this week argue about an ancient relic that only a tiny minority of the british public have any interest in but that ’s enough about the tory party in they all promise the country that they would control immigration say number will come down and 
 the british people will be in control 
 how be it go 
 let i be crystal clear the level of migration be far too high and i be determined to bring they back down to sustainable level that be why we have ask the migration advisory committee to review certain element of the system we be review those finding and will bring forward next step early this year we announce the tough action ever take to reduce legal migration the effect of that action be yet to be feel but will impact student dependant forecast show that migration be likely to drop as a result up until this moment all we have hear from the right hon and learn gentleman on this topic be a secret backroom deal with the eu that would see an additional migrant here every year 
 never mind the british museum it be the prime minister who have obviously lose his marble the greek prime minister come to london to meet he a fellow nato member an economic ally and of our most important partner in tackle illegal immigration instead of use that meeting to discuss those serious issue the prime minister try to humiliate he and cancel at the last minute why such small politic prime minister 
 of course we be always happy to discuss important topic of substance with our ally like tackle illegal migration or strengthen our security but when it be clear that the purpose of the meeting be not to discuss substantive issue for the future but to grandstand and relitigate issue of the past it be not appropriate furthermore specific commitment and assurance on that topic be make to this country and then break it may seem alien to the right hon and learn gentleman but in my view when people make commitment they should keep they 
 i discuss the economy security and immigration with the greek prime minister i also tell he we would not change the law regard the marble it be not that difficult the reality be simple the prime minister have no plan on boat crossing and migration be at a record high his policy be that company can pay worker from abroad less than british worker and that have contribute to those record high immigration level have it not 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about the boat crossing but have fail to notice that illegal boat crossing be down by a this year thank to all the action we have take which he oppose every single time they be raise no will be surprised that he be back an eu country over britain just last week he be ask which song good sum up the labour party what do he come up with he show his true colour and choose ode to joy”—literally the anthem of the european union he will back brussels over britain every single time 
 let i get this straight the prime minister be now say that meet the prime minister of greece be somehow support the eu instead of discuss serious issue he have just dig far into that hole that he have make for himself rather than deal with the fact he be prosecute his man war on reality and that reality be stick under this government a bricklayer from overseas can be pay   £ less than somebody who be already here a plasterer £ less and an engineer £ less the list go on it be absurd labour would scrap his perverse wage cut policy why will he not do so 
 as i have say we have take significant measure and will bring forward more indeed as the office for national statistics itself say more recent estimate indicate a slowing of immigration as a result of the thing that we be do but i be surprised to hear the right hon and learn gentleman now take this new position i have a quote here from a pushy young shadow immigration minister who say to this house i directly quote this person that limit on skilled migrant be 
 a form of economic vandalism”.—[official report   march vol c. 19wh 
 who could possibly have take such a bizarre position only to u turn it will come as no surprise to anybody that it be he 
 there be only party that have lose control of the border and its member be sit right there this be a government who be not just in turmoil but in open revolt the immigration minister think that the prime minister be fail because apparently nobody will listen to his secret plan the former home secretary think that he be fail because of his magical thinking the current home secretary think that he be fail he even take time out of his busy schedule of insult people in the north east to admit that he agree with labour the prime minister seem to be the only person on the tory benches without his own personal immigration plan clearly his own side do not have any faith in he why should the public 
 it be really a bit rich to hear about this from someone who describe all immigration law as racist and who literally say that it be a mistake to control immigration we have take step and we will take further step which be why recent estimate show that immigration be slow it be why next year the immigration health surcharge will increase by more than third it be why immigration fee be go up by up to of his own front bench team say that have a target be not sensible it be no surprise to have people like that because while we be take all these measure that he oppose this be the person who stand on a platform and promise to defend free movement 
 on this government ’s watch migration have just treble and the prime minister be give the house a lecture about target he be lose in la la land there can be few experience more haunting for conservative members than hear this prime minister claim that he be go to sort out a problem he say that he would get nhs waiting list down they go up unabashe by that he say that he would get control of immigration it have go up follow that experience he turn his hand to bring taxis down and would you believe it the tax burden be now go to be high than ever it be ironic that he have suddenly take such a keen interest in greek culture when he have clearly become the man with the reverse midas touch everything he touch turn to perhaps the home secretary can help i out rubbish interruption we might have to check the tape again mr speaker 
 will the prime minister do the country a favour and warn we what he be plan next so that we can prepare ourselves for the disaster that will inevitably follow 
 more 
 at the beginning of the year we say 
 more 
 order 
 at the beginning of the year we say that we would halve inflation and this government have deliver ease the burden of the cost of live for family everywhere we know about the right hon and learn gentleman ’s plan all the way through that what do he do he back inflationary pay rise and talk about welfare no control for welfare and about borrow £ a year that would just make the situation bad he mention tax just this past week we have deliver the big tax cut since the 1980s for million of people and business and increase pension and benefit and this week we secure £ of new investment for this country so he can keep try to talk 
 order can i just say to the shadow foreign secretary—[interruption order just a little bit quieter please i want to hear 
 the government have rightly respond to the shocking and unacceptable rise in antisemitism and we see extra funding in the autumn statement i note that of religiously aggravate offence last year be against the muslim community yet in the autumn statement there be no funding to deal with islamophobia the government ’s independent adviser on islamophobia role have be leave vacant for over year as the prime minister know we discuss these matter over a year ago yet no action have take place prime minister enough be enough with regard to tackle anti muslim hatred will the government now finally take action 
 we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and expect it to be deal with wherever it occur i actually recently meet tell mama a service that provide support to victim of anti muslim hatred which we have in fact support with over £ of funding since its inception we be in regular dialogue with it we have also double the funding for protective security measure through the protective security for mosque scheme and we will continue to do everything we can to keep our muslim community safe 
 i call the snp leader 
 in good news for kid in aberdeen this morning it be snow when they look out of the kitchen window they would have be fill with delight but many of their parent who look out of the kitchen window this morning would have be fill with dread dread from know that they simply can not afford to pay their energy bill in that context do the prime minister regret offer no financial mechanism whatever for family this winter 
 it be simply not right to say that there be not support for family this winter there have be considerable support this year for energy bill this winter pensioner household for example will receive up to £ alongside their winter fuel payment they be some of the most vulnerable household and it be right that they get that support at a difficult time 
 i appreciate that it be difficult for the prime minister to empathise when he quite clearly can not understand but to be clear to he and indeed the whole house this be not a matter of energy production scotland produce time more gas than we consume and around third of our electricity already come from renewable resource this be a consequence of decade of fail energy policy here in westminster those of we on the scottish national party benches believe that scotland ’s energy wealth and energy resource should benefit the people of scotland why do n’t he 
 the entire energy grid infrastructure in this country be integrate which bring benefit to people in every part of our united kingdom when it come to support people with energy bill early this year we increase benefit to the high rate on record it be why we provide cost of living payment worth £ on top of regular support it be right not to wait until the last moment to give people that support we give it to they early this year so that they would have the security they need go into winter as i say on top of the money for pensioner when there be cold snap we have cold weather payment that kick in and the warm home discount which provide an extra £ to the most vulnerable household all that be the most considerable action take by any government to help people with their energy bill 
 the £ redevelopment of kettering general hospital be the no.1 investment priority for local resident the part be a £ new energy plant to power the expand and improved hospital will my right hon friend the prime minister please do all he can to ensure that the department of health get spade in the ground on time next spring so that we can get the construction of our redevelop much love local hospital fully under way 
 i thank my hon friend for continue to champion the new hospital in kettering we be absolutely committed to deliver the scheme for kettering general hospital as my hon friend will be aware the new energy centre be vital to the delivery of the new hospital and we expect that work to begin in the quarter of next year the new hospital programme be work closely with the trust to ensure that the plan be deliverable 
 year ago the government make a commitment to new hospital and significant upgrade to hospital in most need but today many scheme be badly delay the royal berkshire stick at the development stage with not a single pound transfer for construction harrogate district hospital still wait on £ for urgent upgrade after reinforce autoclave aerate concrete be discover there be more such scheme will   the prime minister explain why his government be happy to let patient doctor and nurse suffer for year in such unfit and unsafe condition 
 we be deliver hospital by good progress be already be make and that programme be be back by over £ of investment scheme be already open be open this year and be in construction or work have begin to prepare the site it be absolutely right though that within that we prioritise raac hospital that require a reprioritisation but that be the appropriate thing to do to ensure safety patient and staff be already benefit from some of the improvement that we have make which come on top of the large capital programme for the nhs in its history roll out community diagnostic centre urgent treatment centre and surgical hub right across the country 
 as disturb as i be to learn that british politician be be debanke by the national westminster bank the prime minister can imagine my horror to find that an entire town bakewell in the derbyshire dale be be debanke by the national westminster bank in the whole of the derbyshire dale and the peak district there be not a bank leave do my right hon friend share my concern as we be the major shareholder that the national westminster bank be ignore my vulnerable elderly constituent and my businessman bakewell be a big thriving market town

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if she will provide an update on the uk government ’s commitment in relation to cop28 
 i be glad to come to the house to discuss this important subject today the upcoming cop host by the united arab emirates be an important moment in the climate crisis amid record temperature and emission the comprehensive stocktake of progress against the paris agreement at cop28 will show that the world be badly off track we have make significant progress through the paris agreement with temperature projection shift from ° c before paris to between ° c and ° c after glasgow through nationally determined contribution commitment but we know that that be not enough 
 in glasgow we cement the goal of limit global temperature increase to ° c as our north star that have be carry forward by the uae presidency the late science and the impact we be see even at ° c show we why a top priority for the united kingdom be to leave cop28 with a clear road map towards keep ° c in reach from the global stocktake the uk head to cop28 with a record at home and internationally that we can be proud of the prime minister recently affirm our commitment to net and set out our new approach to get there at home we have decarbonise fast than any other major economy by since look forward our target require the large reduction in emission of any major economy 
 year on from glasgow the need to accelerate action be more urgent than ever the world need to decarbonise more than time fast than we have do in the last decade at cop28 we want to see progress against area ambitious new commitment and action include a pathway to keep ° c within reach from the global stocktake scale up clean energy through commitment to triple renewable double energy efficiency and move beyond fossil fuel progress on finance reform deliver $ for develop economy build resilience to climate impact include by double adaptation finance and establish a loss and damage fund and finally progress on restore nature action to deliver net be not just a matter of do the right thing by avoid harm it be crucial to our security and prosperity here in the uk now and in the future 
 the global net transition could be worth £ to uk business between and uk business be in the vanguard in recognise the opportunity more than third of ftse company and thousand of small business have pledge to reduce their emission in line with the ° c goal under the race to campaign more than half the signatory to that campaign be from the united kingdom net be already an engine for growth and revitalisation of formerly deindustrialise area in the united kingdom at cop28 we need to show progress in deliver the historic agreement that we land in glasgow and we must use our uk expertise to scale green finance 
 i thank the minister for her response cop28 will be the most consequential climate summit since cop21 in paris yet we be way off track the un ’s recent emission gap report warn that current pledge under the paris agreement would see temperature rise of between ° c and ° c this century minister be fond of say that the uk have the most ambitious nationally determine contribution for of any major economy yet the minister will also be aware of the climate change committee ’s recent assessment that 
 the uk be unlikely to meet its ndc 
 that be not least because the committee calculate that just of the require emission reduction for be cover by credible government plan she will know that target without plan be cheap what concrete plan do the government have to urgently close that gap do she agree that we must see an ambitious outcome from the global stocktake with significantly strengthen ndc and new economy wide target by that see the rich country go far and fast 
 do the minister share my outrage over report that the uae plan to use its role as cop28 president to secure oil and gas deal what assessment have she make of the impact of that on trust in the negotiation will she explain why the uk be push for the phase out of unabated fossil fuel rather than of fossil fuel in their entirety do she recognise the view of the high ambition coalition which say that we can not use abatement technology to green light fossil fuel expansion how will she ensure that any agreement that include language on abatement have real tooth deliver real cut in fossil fuel production and do not simply allow for the continuation of business as usual 
 the minister will know that a properly resource and operational loss and damage finance fund must be a litmus test for success at cop28 but there be report that the government will be contribute to that fund from their exist climate finance pot do she agree that we can not tackle ever increase challenge from an ever deplete pot of money what plan do the government have for new and additional finance what innovative source of finance be they look at what assessment have they make of the impact of the uk ’s reclassification of climate finance on climate vulnerable country if the government be serious about lead by example will they finally reverse the greenlighting of the obscene rosebank oilfield 
 i reiterate that the government take this issue incredibly seriously and there be way of demonstrate that the minister for energy security and net my right hon friend   the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart who usually deal with such issue be at cop28 and ready for the conference and we now have a distinct department for this issue the department for energy security and net we know that we be leader in the field i take this issue seriously not just for the people of the united kingdom but for the planet as a whole think about my granddaughter we really do have a commitment to ensure that we be do everything that we can 
 i call dr thérèse coffey interruption order ms lucas i have give you an urgent question if you have a problem 
 there be no answer 
 please the minister will answer as she see fit i be sure that at the end you will want to raise a point of order that be the time you can not have a bite of the cherry i go out of my way to ensure that this issue be cover so please i be sure other member will ask question and it be up to the minister how she answer they i be not responsible for that 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this opportunity for the house to discuss cop28 at the debate on   november when the government grant a full day ’s debate only back benchers speak i and the hon member for putney fleur anderson and for strangford jim shannon there be not a sign of   the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas who be now complain about the response to her question by the way the debate on   november   finish early because of how few people speak 
 do my hon friend agree that vote blue go green be the good way to deliver net do she recognise that nature base solution be vital to achieve net do this not just show again that the green party be all talk and absolutely no action 
 as i have say it be incredibly important that we head towards our commitment between and we cut uk emission by while grow the economy i agree with my right hon friend that if we trust this government to deliver we will ensure we be head on the right path the other thing to mention be that net be an engine for growth and the revitalisation of formerly industrialise area of the uk cut emission be important not just for the climate but for our economy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the un have warn that the world be on course for a catastrophic ° c of warming in part because promise make at cop26 and cop27 have not be fulfil we be run out of last chance we know what we need to do and we know how to do it but where be the sense of urgency the prime minister be sham into attend cop last year i would have think he would be ashamed to be there this year after his climate climbdown last month derail momentum at exactly the wrong time the world need climate leadership 
 do the minister think it be acceptable for the prime minister to sabotage the uk ’s history of climate leadership with his cynical backtracking on net labour will be go to cop with a message that the uk can be a climate leader again and that in do so we will cut energy bill and boost energy independence at home which this government have conspicuously fail to do labour will put the uk back in a position of leadership and establish a clean power alliance we will pledge to issue no new oil gas or coal licence and set an example with our mission for clean power by what example do it set if the current uk government ignore the science and global consensus on fossil fuel especially when the energy secretary admit that her policy will not even cut bill 
 labour will also be work for multilateral development bank reform to help develop country access capital as well as champion the uk as the future green finance capital of the world with mandatory ° c align transition plan for ftse company and financial institution can the minister tell i what the government will be do to advance that agenda 
 there be so much more that the uk can and must do to reduce emission and deliver energy security to cut energy bill and to back british industry with labour britain would lead the world at cop labour be ready to lead be the minister 
 as i have mention we do take this issue incredibly seriously if i think about some of the fact as the hon member rightly mention at the g20 the prime minister announce $ to the green climate fund that be the big single funding commitment that the uk have make to help the world tackle climate change half of that contribution will go to adaptation we be commit and that be why we have a presence at cop28 the house will see that senior member of the uk government be there as well as king charles 
 this country have of the strong record in the world on reduce emission not least give our very successful cop26 summit in glasgow what progress be be make on deliver the historic commitment to tackle deforestation make by the leader at that summit 
 i pay tribute to the work that my right hon friend have do on this subject i will need to get back to she with the exact figure on deforestation if i may of the thing that the uk government be do at cop28 be make sure that we hit the key area of progress finance global stocktake mitigation adaptation and loss and damage and within that nature 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the uk government ’s series of u turn on net target have put our ability to meet they at risk the scottish government be commit to meet our more ambitious target but europe and the united states be lead the way as this place lag behind in turn hold scotland back can the minister confirm whether the new foreign secretary who famously decide to cut the green crap will be attend cop26 that move cost uk household £ in extra energy cost 
 i reassure the hon gentleman that we be committed to ensure we hit all those target as of september more than country account for around of global emission and more than of global gdp be cover by net commitment we be committed to make sure that we hit those target and that be demonstrate by our attendance at cop28 and the measure we be take to ensure we meet the climate challenge 
 the government ’s mobilise green investment strategy publish in march set out that we need $ a year in green   finance by what be the government ’s ambition at cop28 to agree fund anywhere close to that level what more can we do to get our private sector and pension scheme to contribute to that 
 my hon friend make an important point we will have those discussion over the week of cop28 we be try to ensure that we hit all the global target too i be sure that those conversation will come up and we can have a discussion on they later 
 the minister can talk the talk but it be action that count business across every sector as well as expert in the field have react with horror to this government ’s backslide and roll back on climate action and net in fact aviva ’s chief executive amanda blanc say that the government be put our climate goal as a country under threat and therefore job growth and investment at risk do the minister recognise the damage that be do both at home and to our global standing 
 of the thing that this government be commit to be ensure that we have skill in place and that the economy be go in the right direction we be proud of our record and our commitment to make sure we get to net be demonstrate in all the thing we have be do we be international leader world leader in our commitment to ensure that we hit those target 
 i welcome that of the new landscape recovery scheme be in west cornwall and on scilly and i credit the cornwall wildlife trust farm cornwall the duchy other organisation and in particular the landowner for their incredible work to achieve that at previous climate change conference specifically the paris summit we agree to fix our leaky home will the minister meet i to discuss how we can accelerate that effort especially for low income family 
 i know what a champion my hon friend be for his constituent i will of course meet he although perhaps a meeting with the relevant minister would be more appropriate we be committed to make sure that we have that extra security that be why we be make such an investment in work towards energy security while at the same time work towards net 
 the uk be a leader in offshore wind development but be now fall seriously behind cost to offshore wind developer have increase by as much as the recent offshore wind auction failure will have cost the uk gw of new renewable energy and that be entirely predictable how will the prime minister be able to look in the eye the leader of country that be suffer most from the impact of climate change and say the uk do everything it can 
 we be world leader on offshore energy that be of our commitment but we do not just rest on our laurel and think about offshore wind we be also look at other way to   generate electricity which be much need include fusion and small modular reactor the hon lady suggest we be not take into account where we should be go on energy but we be world leader and we be ensure that we have an impact on our future 
 i be look forward to go to cop as of the member of the energy security and net committee last week the committee go to see the world ’s green hydrogen neighbourhood project in fife in scotland local people be give the choice to switch to innovative clean green hydrogen heating and nearly half of they have take that choice do the minister agree that of the big challenge to achieve next be achieve that consumer change and that this be why it be so important that we offer consumer innovation and choice rather than the top down tax and ban approach that the opposition so often promote 
 my hon friend make an important point it be about education ensure that people be educate and think about how we use our future energy however it be also incumbent on we to ensure that we offer choice which be why we be committed to offshore and to make sure that we be invest in science and technology and get all of that technology available thus make energy available in lot of different form 
 after the last cop the prime minister at the time boris johnson assure the house that there would be no funding whatsoever from british source for fossil fuel development anywhere in the world since then the uk government have announce their own fossil fuel development with oil and gas extraction so how on earth do the minister expect to be take seriously at cop when britain itself be invest more in fossil fuel and then lecture the rest of the world that they should not do so can she assure we that this cop be not just go to be an exercise in greenwash with a sideshow of oil dealing and that it be go to be a serious attempt to deal with the serious fundamental issue that this planet face 
 yes uk production be decline when we think about oil and gas it be important that we think about have a balanced approach and make sure that we keep our supply go as it should of the thing we be commit to be make sure that on balance we also have other option available it be important to remember that from an economic point of view the job that be create be really important from an oil and gas point of view and of course that will be invest in green energy as well so it be a cyclical thing to make sure that we be invest in our future 
 have spend a year in the energy department it have be an absolute pleasure to see how civil servant business the public and indeed minister be at the forefront of ensure that the uk be the major economy that have decarbonise furth and fast in the world we account for only of emission we have the big offshore wind farm in the world as well as the big and the big we have more solar panel than france we really be lead the way so when we go to cop   we need to make sure that other see that there be an advantage in do this and join we on that journey what will the minister ’s message be at cop to make sure that the world join we on this journey 
 i thank my hon friend for make those point he have work closely with the department and see at hand the work that we have be do and it be good to hear that reiterate in the house of the thing that we be look for be success at cop28 and success would be make sure that we be support those measure but also progress and make sure that we have a commitment to the world ’s future and make a green climate 
 the government be go into these global climate talk have announce new north sea oil and gas field if every country copy this government ’s approach of squeeze out every last drop of oil and gas we would risk extreme global temperature rise of ° c every respected climate body have warn of the danger of this approach so at the climate talk why should any other country listen to this government when their policy be not compatible with the uk ’s own climate commitment 
 of course we be commit to do other thing as well which be what i be reiterate we have a commitment to make sure that we learn from research and development and that we be look at offshore wind but we also need to be realistic which be why we be look at oil and gas it will have an impact on the economy and it will help towards a green economy because of the investment that will be make through the oil and gas finance 
 climate change be the single big threat to humanity and i will be look forward to attend cop28 myself i be pleased that it be take place in the middle east give the need to transition away from fossil fuel we seem to forget our own history because it be we in persia in mesopotamia and on the arab peninsula that get the middle east on to the road of oil and gas exploration do my hon friend agree that we be able to get our co2 emission down today because of the offshore wind farm in the english channel and that those be the result of a lot of investment from the united arab emirates 
 it be always a great pleasure to listen to my right hon friend who remind we of the history and of how we get to this point however we need to acknowledge all the good thing that we be do and i reiterate that we be look at ensure sure that we have a secure energy future 
 be it not just a little bit embarrassing that as ministers head to the gulf for cop the european marine energy centre in my constituency be have to consult on downsize and restructuring because the minister ’s colleague in the department of levelling up housing and communities have be unable to provide the year funding stream that they have previously undertake to provide will she speak to her colleague in dluhc to ensure that some certainty on that money   can be give and that the centre can continue its genuinely world lead work on the development of marine renewable energy 
 that be obviously not my department but i would be happy to take that away and facilitate a meeting or indeed have a meeting myself 
 new research by ulster university find that over of home in northern ireland will need to be retrofit if we be to have a chance of meet our net target and that at the current rate of retrofit we have no chance of meet our goal do the minister believe that the support available to provider such as the northern ireland housing executive and housing association across the region be adequate to allow they to tackle the climate breakdown and fuel poverty far know the impact of climate change on the poor country in the world will the government finally make real the loss and damage fund to help those most affected to adapt and mitigate and will she ensure that that fund be new money and not just a raid on exist press aid budget 
 with the hon lady ’s permission i would prefer to write to she because part of those question be slightly outside my remit however i reiterate that of the thing we be determined to do be tackle fuel poverty that be of the reason why we have a commitment to do this also there be a lot of support that people can get and i would encourage everybody to get what they be entitle to 
 i have some great green innovator in my constituency but it have be heartbreake speak to they over the last few month about the impact that the government ’s suppose reset on net be have on their business they include new fuel cell producer green aviation leader company provide key supply chain part to the car industry and renewable energy company their business may be different but the story be the same the lack of action from the government be make it hard for they to get investment hard for they to create job and hard for they to bring growth to mid bedfordshire my constituent ultimately see through the government ’s shallow positioning on this issue hearteningly for i but it be unfortunate that this issue continue to hang over their prospect how can we show leadership on this issue at cop28 at a time when the government can not even get out of the way of people look to bring growth to my constituent 
 this government have demonstrate a commitment to investment in all these area particularly from a science and technology point of view i know that uk trade and investment have immense commitment and give out support for this but there be many thing that we have be do we have not just be invest in r&d from a science point of view what we be do be invest in offshore wind in alternative fuel and in all those thing that will enable we to get to where we need to be 
 in the uk heating home account for of carbon emission and in england our home produce more emission   than car do that be not only cost the environment in the future it be also cost taxpayer now a decade ago the then prime minister cameron ’s green crap riddance result in uninsulated loft and in cavity wall be leave unfilled give that that decision be now add billion in additional cost to taxpayer and make it hard to meet the decarbonisation target can the minister ask the foreign secretary whether he regret it 
 we be invest in make sure that home be insulate and energy efficient it be worth point out that between and the uk cut emission by while grow the economy by more than i can of course pass on the hon gentleman ’s message to the foreign secretary 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i would appreciate any advice you can give i on a matter of great interest and concern to my constituent it relate to the attitude of national highways official in the north west office a freedom of information request reveal several email that in my view show a worrying lack of candour and transparency in national highways dealing with i in relation to the replacement of a footbridge on a major road in my constituency in particular i have be accuse of whip up a frenzy among my constituent in relation to that important safety matter i be do my job not whip up a frenzy any advice from you would be welcome 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give i notice of his point of order i certainly agree that he or any other member should not be criticise for pursue issue of concern to their constituent the hon gentleman have put his concern on the record and i believe the minister may wish to make a quick point 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker   the hon member for bootle peter dowd   be kind enough to notify i of his intention to make a point of order and i have already begin the process of look into it it be fair to say that he be a friend of mine although i know that many will hold that against he he be merely do his job and i will make sure that that continue 
 i be about to say that the hon gentleman might want to consider raise the issue with ministers but that have already happen i be grateful to the minister and i be sure that the issue will be consider between the of they 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i be very grateful to mr speaker for grant my urgent question but do you have any advice on what can be do when a minister simply refuse to answer a single question and essentially abuse the procedure of the house i ask question in good faith the minister be on her foot for second during which time we learn that the secretary of state be at cop that there be a department for energy security and net and that the minister ’s granddaughter care a lot about the planet that be all very fascinating but it do not answer a single of my question how can we do our job as member hold the government to account when ministers can stand at the dispatch box for second and not answer a single question on an issue deem worthy of an urgent question 
 i thank the hon lady for her point of order but i be not responsible for the answer give by ministers i believe the minister would like to say something 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker i believe   that i have answer most of the question the hon lady ask in my opening remark my understanding be that i be to give a short response if there be anything i have not respond to i be happy to respond in writing my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   make the important point that there have be previous debate on this issue and i suggest that if the hon lady have turn up to those debate she would have be able to have a fuller—[hon member hear hear 
 order i thank the minister for that response both the hon lady and the minister have put their view on the record i be sure that there will be further opportunity after the summit for the issue to be discuss 
 rise 
 i do not want to prolong this exchange but i will allow a very brief point 
 on the point make by   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   and just now by the minister they will know that there be person represent my party and i can not be in place at once i be work on it there be conservative members and just back bencher be at the debate last week i suggest that they look at get their own house in order before criticise this side 
 this be get way beyond anything resemble a point of order so we should move on swiftly

 bill read the time to be read a time tomorrow and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en 
 bill to be consider 
 mr speaker have select the recommittal motion in the name of sir chris bryant i call he to move the motion 
 i beg to move 
 that the bill be re committed to a public bill committee 
 i wish to briefly refer to the death yesterday morning of my predecessor as member of parliament for rhondda allan rogers i know that many member find he a good colleague to work with and i believe that he spend many hour on the channel tunnel act i sometimes think that the people who do such bills on behalf of all of we deserve a medal i be sure the whole house send its good regard and deep condolence to his family 
 our core job as member of parliament be the scrutiny of legislation tease out whether a proposal will do what it say whether it be necessary and proportionate and whether it have public support the government have have total control of the order paper since so we can do that job properly only if the government get their act together and play ball that be what enable the line by line consideration of the law that bind we it be what make we a function democracy we need to send the bill back to committee because we simply can not do that job properly today 
 let we recall how we get here a version of the data protection and digital information bill be introduce by the previous member for mid bedfordshire on   july it be such a mess that it never even make it to reading nadine dorries be sack in september last year and month later the bill be sack as well to be replace by a new and improved no bill which have its reading on   april   and complete its committee stage on   may that be day ago 
 i do not know what have prompt all the delay be it the general chaos in government perhaps the government do not fully understand the term with immediate effect i like the minister and i have know and work with he on many different issue for many year i have a meeting with he and his official on   thursday november he tell i then that on report the government would table only a few minor and technical amendment to the bill which he hop everyone would be able to agree fairly easily 
 on the last available day day after committee the government bring out amendment some be indeed minor and technical but many be very significant they strike to the heart of the independence of the new information commission they alter the right of the public in make subject access request and they amend our system in a way that may or may not enhance our data adequacy with the us and the european union and therefore british business ability to rely on uk legislation to trade overseas in some instance they give very extensive new power to ministers and they introduce completely new topic that have never be previously moot debate or scrutinise   by parliament in relation to this bill which already have more bauble on it than the proverbial christmas tree the end result be that we have page of amendment to consider today in a single debate 
 yes we could have table amendment to the government amendment but they would not have be selectable and we would not have be able to vote on they so the way the government have act whether knowingly recklessly or incompetently mean that the commons can not carry out line by line consideration of what will amount to more than page of new law new clause and new schedule of which be page long some measure will barely get a minute ’s consideration today that be not scrutiny it be a blank cheque 
 yesterday i make a generous offer to the minister for disabled people health and work   the hon member for corby tom pursglove who be sit on the front bench and whom i also like we recognise that some of the issue need to be address so we say recommit the bill so we can help you get this right in the commons and we will commit to have it out of committee in a fortnight it could go to the lords with all party support by christmas 
 let i repeat this be no way to scrutinise a bill particularly that give the government sweep power and limit the right of our fellow citizen the public sadly it be part of a grow trend but legislate at speed repent at leisure should not be our motto some will say something that be commonly say these day let it go through to the lords so they can amend it but i be sick of abdicate responsibility for get legislation right it be our responsibility we should not send bills through that be at good half consider we be the elect representative we can not just pass the parcel to the lords we need to do our job properly we can not do that today without recommit the bill 
 i begin by join   the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant   in express the condolence of the house to his predecessor allan rogers he serve as a member of parliament during my year in this place i remember he as an assiduous constituency member of parliament and i be sure we all share the sentiment express by the hon gentleman
