my hon friend be absolutely right about the challenge right across our send system a system that the secretary of state herself have describe as lose lose lose 
 school leader know that this be a disaster yet early this month the department update we all on the work of the workload reduction taskforce it be not the work of teacher the taskforce clarifie to investigate a pupil ’s absence teacher may do it it be vital work that need do but it also depend on our amazing support staff 
 labour ’s plan to tackle the attendance crisis start with our small child it include a childcare system modernise from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school high quality early education a focus on life chance for child not just on work choice for parent and high and rise standard right from the start with early language intervention to identify and remove barrier to learn and a determination to reform the send system to put money behind child not lawyer and to tackle issue before they hold child back with a new focus on primary numeracy so that child love math at never mind at excellence for everyone not for some of our child but for all of they there will be free breakfast club in every primary school because it be about the club not just the breakfast every day every child every life and every start 
 there will be new qualified teacher and a new national voice for our support staff ofsted will be reform and improve we will end the high stake low information culture with annual check for attendance safeguard and off rolling there will be mental health councillor in our secondary school and new community hub outside they join up the information that we have on our child so that every child can be support between school and service every issue catch share and address and the cause for which we ask for time today a law to register and count the child who be out of school 
 labour be clear on how we will fund that package and the change that we need by end the tax break for private school and the mega rich we will invest in what we most believe in our child and their future excellence for everyone high and rise standard and a britain where background be no barrier to opportunity the legislation that we will introduce next month with the house ’s permission if today ’s motion be agree to will be simple it will be part of the government ’s own schools bill from which provide for a register of child not in school that be nothing that conservative members would not have be prepare to vote for have it be table by their own minister so there can be no reason or excuse for conservative members who care   about this issue not to support the motion today and the bill next month they can choose their party or our child i commend the motion to the house 
 this government be commit to give every child in this country a class education and every opportunity to make the most of their ability although there be a small number of child who for good reason need to be educate elsewhere we want all child to be at school every day that be key for their life chance for child who be home educate a right that parent have and we do not question that most do a very good job it be vital that we know that the education they be provide with be suitable and that the child be safe 
 as my right hon friend the schools minister say the motion conflate separate thing the issue of persistent absence which be when pupil miss or more of their lesson and the topic of home education for those who be not in school to take persistent absence the year the government come to power persistent absence be at we get that down to in and it average in the year prior to the pandemic it be during the pandemic that it rise significantly again to 
 the government be take wide range action to tackle the matter we have already establish attendance hub across school reach pupil this term we be more than double the number of hub so that nearly school will be support we be roll out an attendance mentor pilot that we have in area to a further area and that programme will reach around child we have deploy expert attendance adviser to support local authority and school trust we have develop a data tool that help school to understand the local trend and target their support and we have strengthen our guidance to local authority for the time school be expect to have a member of the senior leadership team responsible for attendance 
 evidence suggest that the strategy be work there be few persistently absent pupil in the past academic year and in the last academic term overall absence be down to from in the autumn term the year before that be all back by a national communication campaign to remind parent that moment matter attendance count the campaign aim to encourage parent to realise that their child should attend school if they have a mild cough or cold and no fever or vomiting and that mild anxiety can be make bad by a prolong period of absence the campaign have be run across social medium and the radio we be grateful to sir chris whitty the chief medical officer for his letter reassure school leader that child should generally attend school if they have mild respiratory illness because it be good for their wellbeing and a host of other thing 
 of course mental health challenge underpin some of the absence something raise by   the hon member for kingston upon hull west and hessle emma hardy among other that be why we have be roll out   mental health support team which now cover of pupil in school and college and will cover of those pupil by march we be offer all state school and college a grant to train a senior mental health lead and we be pleased that school and college have already take that up cover school in for all state secondary school 
 there be then the related but separate issue of a register for those who be home educated i should declare that i serve on the education committee when my right hon friend   the member for harlow robert halfon   chair it and we produce a report that recommend a register for those not in school that remain a recommendation of the education committee that be the register that be in the schools bill refer to in the motion and for which we remain committed to legislate my hon friend   the member for meon valley mrs drummond   have be do great work to champion this issue and i look forward to the outcome of the reading of her child not in school registers support and orders bill on   march 
 various point be raise in this debate and i will try and cover as many as possible the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders for somerton and frome sarah dyke and for west lancashire ashley dalton raise issue about the send system our send and ap improvement plan be design to address the issue that they raise about child be place in suitable provision and in a timely manner we should not have child out of school for prolong period because they be unable to get their need meet 
 my right hon friend   the member for chelmsford vicky ford who i think be currently at her westminster hall debate have introduce an important bill the school attendance duty of local authorities and proprietors of schools bill and i look forward to see its progress through the house   the hon member for wirral south alison mcgovern   raise the topic of breakfast club which we be fund in school many school already have a breakfast club of course and have have for some time but we be fund 
 my hon friend   the member for st austell and newquay steve double   raise the issue of fix penalty notice our guidance be clear that there should be a support approach but penalty be there to prevent court action from take place i should say that of the fixed penalty notice issue be for unauthorised term time holiday but i be happy to pick up that discussion with he 
 my final point be this i have watch the labour party try to reinvent itself as the champion of child be in school and many labour members have raise issue about the pandemic which be where many of the problem stem from however i remember their action during that pandemic i remember how long it take they to say that school be safe i remember the then prime minister stand here every week ask the leader of the opposition to say that school be safe and he not do so 
 i remember that when of labour ’s union ally produce a statement say that teacher should not be teach a full timetable nor routinely mark work during that period labour say nothing to challenge it when that same union team up with other union to produce a point list of thing they want to see before school return the labour party say nothing   to challenge they what be labour ’s big idea during the pandemic to go against the vaccination advice of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation which be that we should vaccinate by age and instead vaccinate teacher no other profession just teacher whatever their age why because the union want that to happen 
 in addition to the motion conflate separate thing and in addition to this problem be bad in labour run wales like all problem be we will not allow the labour party to reinvent the history of their behaviour under this leader of the opposition they can not blame the last leader of the opposition for that it be under this leader of the opposition   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer it be this government who do all they could to get child back to school during the pandemic and it be this government who be do all they can to get child back to school now 
 question put 
 i will give way to the hon gentleman in a moment because he know more about this than many who have speak the reality be that tata tell we that it be look to pull out completely from the united kingdom if the loss of job be devastating it certainly be how much more devastating would be and job in the supply chain it be a simple choice for the government not a good between see people lose their job or around people lose their job and possibly even more that be why the government commit to pay £ towards an arc furnace let i make other thing clear the government will not pay a penny to tata until that arc furnace be build 
 i understand the hon gentleman ’s position and he be right to stand up for his worker this be the reality of the situation that plan have not persuade tata tata have not say that it be credible tata have say to i that it could not go along with that plan because although of the blast furnace blast furnace no have a number of year to run it would still come to the end of the life of the coke plant and the sinter plant so if tata go ahead with that proposal it would keep open blast furnace which be still lose a lot of money and then have to start import all the coke and all the sinter that it would need for it 
 there be then the technical problem in that tata say it would be very difficult indeed to build an arc furnace next to a work blast furnace contain molten steel interruption the hon gentleman can shake his head but that be what it be say to we that be what it have say to we as a government and that be why we find ourselves in the difficult unpleasant and awful situation of have to choose between people lose their job and people lose their job that be why we come to the decision we do 
 my hon friend be push against an open door he may be aware that in we make some legislative change to give the general dental council more flexibility to expand the registration option open to international dentist triple the capacity of sitting of the overseas registration exam from august and increase the number of sitting for the part exam in from to that will create an additional place overall for overseas dentist aim to work in the uk we will also be bring forward measure to enable dental therapist to work at the top of their training which will expand the capacity he be right that reform of the uda be also require and we will be bring forward our plan shortly 
 i understand the hon gentleman ’s position and he be right to stand up for his worker this be the reality of the situation that plan have not persuade tata tata have not say that it be credible tata have say to i that it could not go along with that plan because although of the blast furnace blast furnace no have a number of year to run it would still come to the end of the life of the coke plant and the sinter plant so if tata go ahead with that proposal it would keep open blast furnace which be still lose a lot of money and then have to start import all the coke and all the sinter that it would need for it

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to support the child of alcohol dependent parent 
 may i start by wish   the hon member for ilford north wes streeting   a speedy recovery 
 we be take a wide range approach to alcohol harm some £ have be invest in specialist alcohol care team in a quarter of hospital with the high need and we have publish the ever uk wide clinical guideline on harmful drinking and alcohol dependence as well as provide around £ in funding to local authority through the family hub and start for life programme family hub fund through that programme be encourage to provide full wrap around support for family which may include alcohol support service 
 to the government ’s credit they be currently put money into addiction service however at the same time there be no national strategy for child of alcohol dependent parent that have not always be the case between and there be local and national helpline service fund through a national strategy will the secretary of state meet i to discuss this matter as the child in these awful situation be some of the most vulnerable in society 
 may i thank my hon friend for her care and also for share her experience on this subject through the drug strategy we have commit an extra £ of funding over year to improve alcohol and drug treatment service with £ invest in lancashire last year we see a furth £ invest nationally in line with guidance for the extra drug strategy funding which allow local authority to fund target service for parent in need of treatment and support for their child and family i will of course be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this far 
 rise 
 barry sheerman briefly—[laughter 
 i have turn over a new leaf mr speaker 
 may i urge the secretary of state to take this issue very seriously to direct much more social medium at young people and to get into school the message about the real damage that can be do to the entire life of a child if the mother be drink alcohol during pregnancy 
 i thank the hon gentleman for bring some insight into how we can well reach family of course it be not just mum but father or carer who can have a huge impact on our child that be why the under secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend   the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom be invest so much energy and commitment in our family hub we believe that they can be the centre for family to make the very good start to a child ’s life 
 what recent progress her department have make on support the timely discharge of patient from hospital into social care 
 discharge people on time be well for they and free up hospital bed we be change how our health system work to do that join up health and social care and care transfer hub help people to recover at home with more than new virtual ward bed and invest in social care and it be work last month delay discharge be down compare with the end of december despite almost extra urgent admission to hospital every day in december 
 nearly in bed in my local healthcare trust in buckinghamshire continue to be occupy by patient fit for discharge a recent king ’s fund report find that the government ’s current practice of provide off funding to reduce delay while welcome come with insufficient advance notice to allow for effective planning what step be the minister ’s department take to ensure the good use of this funding 
 reason we distribute discharge funding back in april last year be to give more advance notice to organisation so that they could put in place what be need to speed up discharge i say to the hon lady that our plan be work that be why in her own trust discharge at the end of december be down by a compare with the previous year 
 i note the progress that my hon friend reference but delay discharge be still a major issue patient flow through a hospital be a critical factor especially at the front door through emergency department we know the role that electronic bed management system can play in help that flow what step be my hon friend take to ensure that more hospital roll out that technology 
 my hon friend be right i know how much work he do when he have oversight of urgent and emergency care service which include his contribution to our urgent and emergency care recovery plan that be publish almost a year ago that plan include a host of step to improve the flow through hospital include investment in bed management system as he describe the plan be work which be why we be improve the flow through hospital and see reduction in delay discharge 
 what step she be take to increase the recruitment of qualified nurse from overseas 
 nhs datum show that we have deliver early on our manifesto commitment to have an extra nhs nurse with the number of nurse work in our nhs increase from around in to today that have be achieve through boost training and education route ethically recruit internationally and take action to improve retention measure such as the health and care visa introduce in support international recruitment 
 i thank the minister for his answer as he know the national health service would completely collapse without the input and expertise of clinical staff from around the world barrier to those people come to help we be the high fee for apply for permanent residency some nurse from country such as india and the philippines be have to take out expensive loan just to feel like they be welcome and able to stay in our country i have present a private member ’s bill to exempt nhs clinical staff from pay those high fee to become resident will the minister support the bill and work with his home office colleague to find a way to make that a reality for those people who work so hard in our health service 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute to the enormous contribution make by internationally recruit staff to our nhs as he will know immigration policy and fee be a matter for my right hon friend the home secretary however our long term workforce plan support international recruitment in addition to the new visa route we be exempt health and care staff from the immigration health surcharge 
 the minister will know that without our fantastic workforce the nhs would not work i pay tribute to all those hard work nurse in all our hospital and care centre include at st thomas hospital in my constituency do the minister recognise that in addition to recruiting staff we have to look at retain staff who talk about the workload their mental wellbeing and the fact that the cost of living be have a big impact on they do the minister agree that the government need to come forward with a wide range plan on address workforce planning pay training staff wellbee and retention 
 i completely agree with the hon lady which be why this government become the government ever to introduce a long term workforce plan retention be of the key pillar of the long term workforce plan and we be already see that deliver the result of keep more staff in our nhs 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the level of accessibility to dental appointment on urgent dental and oral surgery service 
 what recent step she have take to increase capacity in nhs dental care 
 what progress she have make on introduce a dentistry recovery plan 
 i be determined to ensure that everybody who need nhs dental care can receive it we have already implement a package of reform to improve access and provide fairer remuneration for dentist that have have an effect with more adult be see more child be see and a increase in nhs activity in the past year we know we need to do much more and our dentistry recovery plan will be publish shortly set out a big package of change 
 i listen carefully to what the minister say that change have not come to oxfordshire for sure it be in a dire state an oxford resident write to i say that when his nhs practice close he ring a dozen other across the county each say they be offer nhs service but in fact they be not they be only offer private care in this cost of living crisis people simply can not afford that as a result they be wait in a&e rather than get treatment and that end up in their have oral surgery what be the minister do now to improve the situation in oxfordshire and across the country 
 i be incredibly sympathetic to what the hon lady say in fact in buckinghamshire oxfordshire and berkshire west integrate care board the number of adult see by an nhs dentist rise in the month to june from to with a similar increase in the percentage of child see the situation be improve but i completely agree with she that we need to do more and we will be come forward shortly with a big package of dental recovery plan reform 
 i thank my right hon friend for her answer follow my very productive meeting with she only a few day ago will she confirm that nhs england locally have finally be unblocked and that my constituent in clacton will soon benefit from more dentist practise on nhs patient 
 as my hon friend will know this be a local matter and it be for his icb to determine whether it wish to support the excellent pilot proposal    for overseas dental student in clacton at the same time it need to ensure that its action be compliant with current legislation and within the delegation agreement with nhs england i have just write to my hon friend about that and my letter should address his concern but of course i would be happy to see he again if he have any further question 
 we be promise before the summer we be promise after the summer we be promise before christmas we be promise soon and now we have be promise shortly the reality be that labour have a plan and the government have not in york we can not get an nhs dentist either blossom family dental care be just hand back its contract my constituent have nowhere to go what be the minister go to do to ensure that my constituent can access nhs dentistry 
 as i say to   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran i absolutely understand the challenge for some people the situation have improve over the last year since the covid pandemic where almost every dentist have to stop work altogether we have not see the recovery we want we be put in plan not a paper ambition like the labour have put forward but significant reform that will enable many more people to be see by nhs dentist i say gently to   the hon member for york central rachael maskell   that a recent health service journal article state that humber and north yorkshire icb 
 have indicate in board paper that dentistry funding will be squeeze to help they balance their book 
 i encourage she to talk to her icb about that too 
 for new patient access an nhs dentist in peterborough be almost impossible should a new medical centre wish to establish a new nhs dental practice do so would require flexibility in unit of dental activity rate and the ability to recruit dentist from overseas would the minister give that effort her enthusiastic support and encourage nhs boss to do the same 
 my hon friend be push against an open door he may be aware that in we make some legislative change to give the general dental council more flexibility to expand the registration option open to international dentist triple the capacity of sitting of the overseas registration exam from august and increase the number of sitting for the part exam in from to four.[official report   february vol c. 14mc correction that will create an additional place overall for overseas dentist aim to work in the uk we will also be bring forward measure to enable dental therapist to work at the top of their training which will expand the capacity he be right that reform of the uda be also require and we will be bring forward our plan shortly 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i want to share with ministers the experience of emma from grimsby who say 
 nhs dentistry be a joke in the town at the moment thankfully i manage to get an emergency appointment in scunthorpe after be offer in doncaster originally and i ’ve now be    refer to hospital to have wisdom tooth remove my dentist close at the onset of the pandemic and i ’ve not be able to register with an nhs dentist since 
 what do the minister have to say to emma and the million like she who can not get an appointment when they need 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to point that out emma have my absolute sympathy and apology for the fact that since the covid pandemic we have not see the recovery of dentistry that we would have like i can tell she that in july we bring in significant reform to encourage dentist to take on more nhs patient but we recognise the need to do more the long term workforce plan will increase training place and the overseas registration will improve capacity as will the change to dental therapist programme all those thing will improve the situation but in the meantime we will be bring forward our recovery plan very soon which will immediately expand the incentive to nhs dentist 
 what step her department be take to help reduce pressure on nhs service in winter 
 our plan include open more bed increase ambulance capacity expand innovative service such as virtual ward and bring forward covid and flu vaccination for the most vulnerable thank to the hard work of staff nhs performance this winter have improve on last year despite the impact of industrial action 
 i be sure the caveat to that be the word shortly i have have constituent contact i in desperation regard delay at pinderfields hospital in my constituency they tell i they have wait hour in emergency care this winter for routine blood test literally all day in some case even while in extremely poor health the tories patchwork reform and sticking plaster politic be not fool anyone do the secretary of state not think that those dangerously long waiting time be a damn indictment of year of conservative mismanagement what do she say to my constituent who be suffer right now 
 i be sure that the hon gentleman be a fair man and that be so he will point out to his constituent when they call he with their issue that ambulance response time for category emergency incident in his local area have in fact be over minute fast than last year however we accept of course that this be a year plan and will take time to meet our full ambition interestingly the late figure show that we have provide £ from the community diagnostic centre fund for the development of a community diagnostic centre at wakefield presumably he welcome that conservative innovation 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 the pressure on service be acute this winter as it be every year so far we have hear very little mention in these minute of the big headache face trust integrate care board patient and of course the prime minister ’s pledge to cut the waiting list far give that the british medical association ballot on consultant action close today and that the dispute among doctor in training continue can the secretary of state update the house on her message to those voting today and on where we be in wide industrial dispute which be a drag anchor on the nhs right now 
 my hon friend be right to point out that we be in the final few hour of the consultant ballot on the pay reform programme that we have offer the british medical association i very much hope that consultant will feel able to support that programme because it be about bring together the frankly quite bureaucratic system that they have to deal with at the moment so that they be assess in a short time with less bother and paperwork while respect their need to train and keep up their education and support professional activity commitment i hope that they will agree with we on that as i have say to the junior doctor committee from this dispatch box should they return with reasonable expectation we will of course reopen negotiation 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state have say that preparation for winter start last january but of a&e department be still rat inadequate or need improvement in december exacerbate the winter crisis what will she do differently this year to ensure that we do not have another winter crisis in 
 again the plan that we lay out last year be have a real impact at local level on the service be deploy through our accident and emergency service we have see discharge rate improve for example we appreciate that there can be local difference but the importance that we put on maintain that flow through hospital be critical to ensure that the waiting list and wait time that the hon lady describe be reduce however i gently remind the labour party that it have be run the nhs in wales for some time now and it be a great shame that the good people of wales—[interruption the good people of wales be wait long for their treatment—[interruption they be almost twice as likely 
 order i be a little bother because we have a long way to go on the order paper i call the snp spokesperson 
 we can not discuss winter pressure in the nhs without acknowledge workforce shortage the secretary of state be have to contend with new immigration policy from her cabinet colleague that prevent dependant from come to the uk mean that we be ask people to come and care for our love one while they leave behind theirs i imagine that she be frustrate that   that be now another barrier to recruit staff to our health and care sector have she express those frustration to her cabinet colleague 
 i genuinely want to work with the scottish government because i be troubled to put it bluntly that scotland have some of the bad health outcome in western europe it have the bad level of drug death rate in europe the high alcohol death rate in year and there be a fall in life expectancy for year in a row we offer to allow scottish patient to receive lifesave operation in england but sadly that offer have be decline i remain genuinely willing to work with the scottish government to help they with their health service 
 what step she be take to increase access to child and adolescent mental health service 
 we be invest an extra £ a year to expand mental health service in england with the aim of enable more people to access mental health support include more child and young people 
 many constituent in tamworth be come to i in desperate need of support for their child those constituent include kate whose daughter be at crisis point and have be without a psychiatrist since november roger who have be wait month for an autism referral for his daughter and jess who have be wait for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder assessment for her son will the minister explain what action she be take so that child parent and family in my constituency can get the support they need 
 through the investment we be put in particularly in the hon lady ’s local area there be a number of initiative to help support child and young people with their mental health the sandbox scheme which be a fund nhs service support those in the south staffordshire area malachi provide family support across tamworth and east staffordshire and combined wellbeing which be an online resource cover north staffordshire there be also the family wellbeing service action for child for those age to with mild to moderate mental health need and the staffordshire emotional health and wellbeing service for those age to i would recommend that the hon lady ’s constituent look up those service because we be fund they to improve mental health care for child in her local area 
 the agony and damage of undiagnosed and untreated mental health condition be nowhere more acute than in rural area where we see an epidemic of silent suffering the norfolk and suffolk nhs foundation trust have long struggle with a series of management problem i be sure the minister have see the recent report highlight that between and we see over avoidable death that be nearly a week will she agree to meet   i other norfolk and suffolk mps and those affect to look at what be really go on here and make sure that we turn that trust into a beacon of the good mental health service rather than the bad 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue we be hold regular meeting with norfolk and suffolk mps the trust the care quality commission and nhs england and with the new management team that trust do appear to finally be turn thing around however i be concerned to hear the point that my hon friend have raise i be very happy to restart those meeting and will ask my office to arrange they as quickly as possible 
 what step she be take to increase staff recruitment and retention in the adult social care sector 
 care be a skilled profession and i want care worker to get the support and recognition they deserve this month we take the next step in our ambitious care workforce reform publish the ever national career structure for the care workforce alongside our new nationally recognise care qualification 
 ambitious care workforce reform it be all blah be n’t it we have have year of conservative government and we have a crisis in every area of the nhs job insecurity poor working condition and low pay in care worker be live in poverty be all reason why we have a recruitment and retention crisis in social care be not the truth that that be a damn indictment of year of conservative government and the only thing that be go to sort out social care and the crisis in recruitment and retention be a general election 
 i be actually really shock by the way the hon member refer to the care workforce with term like it be all blah”—very shocking i be determined that care worker should get the recognition they deserve we have a year plan for social care and it be work the care workforce grow by over last year vacancy in social care be down and retention be up we be reform social care so that it work as a career that be why as i say a moment ago i wish the hon member have be listen we have introduce the ever career pathway for social care worker and a new national care qualification 
 i call the shadow minister 
 but accord to care england and hft of social care provider have increase their reliance on agency staff have turn down new admission and have have to close service altogether labour ’s fair pay agreement will ensure that staff in the sector be treat with the dignity and respect that will make they want to stay but after year why do ministers not have a proper plan to address the workforce crisis face adult social care be it because it be a crisis of their making 
 we have a plan for the social care workforce and it be work the social care workforce increase by over last year and it be still go up but i will take no lecture from the hon member in fact his hon friend   the member for bristol south karin smyth early this morning on television make it clear that labour do not have a plan for social care or if it do it be clear that it will cost a lot of money and be yet another unfunded labour plan 
 what step she be take to help improve man ’s health 
 i assure my right hon friend that this government be commit to improve man ’s health that be why in november we announce a suite of measure include a £ fund for a new prostate cancer screening trial and the recruitment of a man ’s health ambassador we have also launch our man ’s health taskforce to tackle the big health issue face man 
 i thank the minister for that answer and i would urge she to continue to make man ’s health a top priority in particular can she look at how we can detect prostate cancer well and soon it be the most common cause of male cancer in the united kingdom and anything that can be do to reduce that number will be most welcome 
 i thank my right hon friend and male colleague on the government benches include my hon friend   the member for don valley nick fletcher who be fight so hard to improve man ’s health he be absolutely right man a year die from prostate cancer that be why we be invest in the £ prostate cancer trial call transform use method such as mri to detect prostate cancer rather than psa which can be inaccurate thousand of man will be recruit we be hop that the trial will start in the spring with recruitment in the autumn include the recruitment of black man who be disproportionately affect by prostate cancer 
 do the minister agree however that the information she have just give about why screen for prostate cancer do not happen for man be base on a study that be year old there be death a year it be the big killer among man and the big killer among all people yet here be this evil cancer for which there be no screening programme whatsoever will she take step to update current nhs guidance to ensure that all those at high risk of prostate cancer receive a targeted early detection service i think she have hint that she may be do that but will she finally introduce mass screening for prostate cancer it be the only cancer without specifically commission early diagnosis work and man be die unnecessarily because of the failure to bring this in 
 we have more than hint we have just announce a £ pilot study of prostate cancer screening we have a plan to tackle those death a year and it will work because until now   we have not have a diagnostic test psa be not a sensitive test in all prostate cancer there be many man with prostate cancer who do not express psa that be why the transform study use detection tool such as mri will be trialle and if they be effective such tool will be roll out across the country 
 what step she be take to increase the recruitment and retention of nhs midwifery and maternity staff 
 we be invest an additional £ a year to improve maternity and neonatal care rise to £ a year from april this will increase the number of midwifery post and improve the quality of care that mother and baby receive   as of october last year there be full time equivalent midwive work in nhs trust and other core organisation in england which be more than more than a year ago and more than in 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response the royal college of midwives estimate that there be a shortage of around full time midwife work in the nhs i know that at hand from cossham hospital in my constituency which have a wonderful birth centre but it have be close for most of the last few year because it simply can not get the midwife to staff it they have to go elsewhere where more serious case need to be deal with what be she do specifically about the retention of midwife i know that student number be thankfully come up but a lot of midwife be choose to leave the profession because there be not enough flexibility in their work 
 i think we all agree that a career as a midwife be just of the most rewarding and fulfilling career that can hope for that be why we have place such priority on retention in the long term workforce plan that we launch last year the national retention programme for midwifery and nursing have prioritise action to support staff retention include menopause guidance because we know that that can be an issue for midwife and value they and their contribution be also a key objective of nhs england ’s year plan for maternity service 
 as well as recruitment and retention training matter anglia ruskin university have a campus in chelmsford and be the provider of the large number of health and social care degree in the country training midwife nurse and since the medical school open doctor will the secretary of state back the campaign to expand the medical school in chelmsford so that we can train even more local people to work in our local nhs

 cancer research uk have publish an ambitious plan long well life which remind we that for some cancer patient just a few week of delay can make the difference between whether they can be offer curative treatment or just palliative care will the new diagnostic centre be open by the government include at finchley memorial hospital bring wait time down and secure that early diagnosis that be so important to survive cancer

 i congratulate nhs england on the launch of the new blood match genetic test for sickle cell patient but it have be more than year since the no ’s listening report which make the key recommendation that sickle cell patient receive pain relief within minute of attend accident and emergency why be that still not happen for sickle cell patient and would the minister like to meet i and the sickle cell society to discuss how to achieve that 
 i of course would be happy to meet the hon lady and the sickle cell society to look at how we can improve patient experience and ensure that all patient benefit from timely access to the medication they need i be delighted that she welcome yesterday ’s announcement it be an example of how the nhs can bring forward world first and be lead the way to transform patient care and improve patient outcome 
 what step her department be take to increase access to urgent and emergency care 
 almost a year ago we publish our urgent and emergency care recovery plan the nhs have already halve the waiting time for category ambulance and bring down wait in a&e. we be determined to cut nhs wait and our plan be work 
 rugby be of the fast grow place in the uk while we have have additional service introduce at our local hospital of st cross my constituent have insufficient accident and emergency provision thousand of local resident have sign my petition for doctor lead accident and emergency care at the hospital of st cross i know it be a matter for the integrate care board but will the minister give her support as a previous minister my hon friend   the member for colchester will quince   and the previous secretary of state have visit in the past few month and i invite this minister to do likewise 
 i thank my hon friend for his invitation he have be a tireless campaigner on this issue on behalf of his constituent the future of healthcare be about get people the care that they need where they need it and when they need it and rugby be no different new local nhs service be bring care close to home in his area such as the new imaging unit at the hospital of st cross that open in september 
 access to urgent and emergency care can be greater facilitated when great protection be offer to staff particularly the many who suffer attack in emergency department at hospital across the united kingdom often by people who be intoxicate 
 the hon member make an important point the safety of our staff in the national health service be important include those in urgent and emergency care department as well as the ambulance service he be absolutely right to point that out and it be never acceptable for anyone include patient to be violent towards staff 
 what step she be take to increase access to mental health service 
 we be invest a record amount in nhs mental health service commit £ extra a year for the expansion and transformation of service in england which will enable more people to access mental health support 
 if only the reality be that rosy the entire sector be call out for reform of the mental health act with our mental health service in crisis why do the government scrap the long await   and overdue mental health bill which could have start to alleviate pressure on trust by reduce the number of people detain inappropriately and make service more fit for purpose be it not true that we need a labour government to take action on this issue 
 it be go to be a long year 
 i have news for the hon gentleman because we have a plan and it be work our investment of £ into crisis support be show early evidence of reduce admission admission be low with the crisis telephone service which be available we have admission down more importantly detention under the mental health act be low we have a plan and it be work 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce the number of people with a learn disability in in patient unit 
 we have make progress against our target to reduce learn disability and autism in patient number in england by since for people with a learn disability without an autism diagnosis there have be a net reduction for people with a learn disability who be autistic the net reduction be 
 i thank the secretary of state for that comprehensive answer as chair of the all party parliamentary group for disability i have be hear from organisation such as mencap that remain concerned that people with learn difficulty be disproportionately detain for to year and for over year will she reassure those organisation that the build the right support action plan will continue to progress the great work that be be do

 should be for the minimum time possible for assessment and/or treatment which can only be provide in hospital 
 in oversee implementation of the action plan go forwards the build the right support delivery board will maintain focus on quality of care and on reduce long stay 
 it be vital for the government to do more to move autistic people and people with learn disability out of in patient unit and back to their community recently in the trial of staff at whorlton hall we see staff who be cruel and uncaring deliver sentence the judge say that whorlton hall be an 
 unpredictable and frightening place to live 
 be it not time for the government to close down those unit and move the majority of people into the community 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that point we be all dismay and upset to see the experience of resident in those unit and we see the correct criminal outcome if i be allow to say that for those involve in those assault a review be go on as to how those issue be affect the estate as a whole but we be clear that in patient stay should happen only when they be strictly necessary we must be mindful that clinician will be take many situation into account include not just the safety of the patient but the safety of the wide community 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 woman ’s health need be often overlook and under research through our woman ’s health strategy the government be change that last year we make menopause a priority help almost half a woman get hormone replacement therapy for less than £ a year this year we be build on that work and will have a woman ’s health hub in every integrate care board area in england we will promote research into condition that only affect woman such as endometriosis and lobular breast cancer and those that affect woman differently from man such as heart attack symptom

 i recently meet constituent with experience of invasive lobular breast cancer invasive lobular carcinoma be the most common form of breast cancer but it be not generally pick up by mammogram and it behave differently from other breast cancer however lobular breast cancer have be understudied and underfunde and it urgently need research funding will the secretary of state tell the house what specific action her government be take to address those gap will she also reply to the lobular moon shot project to which she 
 order this be topical question 
 i gently remind the hon lady about the statement that i just give last week we hold the woman ’s health summit at which i announce that we be encourage research into condition such as lobular breast cancer i make that announcement because of amazing woman i meet recently who be live with the condition they be introduce to i by my right hon friend   the member for horsham sir jeremy quin   and my right hon friend

 i be very sorry to hear of the experience of that specific constituent because of challenge that the nhs face particularly our urgent and emergency care service almost a year ago we set out our urgent and emergency care recovery plan to speed up care for people in a&e and reduce wait that plan be work we be see ambulance get to people quick and people treat quick in a&e. 
 that be not a off why will the minister not take a shred of responsivity for the chaos that her party have cause our nhs the last labour government achieve the short wait and the high patient satisfaction in nhs history the conservatives have deliver the long wait and the low patient satisfaction in history let we have that general election so that she can defend her abysmal record to the public 
 the hon gentleman obviously be not listen to my answer in fact he be read aloud our urgent and emergency care plan be work it be reduce rate in a&e and ambulance be get to people fast meanwhile i be sorry to say that in the labour run nhs in wales more than half of patient be wait more than hour in a&e.

 the hon lady be aware of my knowledge not only of that hospital but of her local area i will look into this matter for she because i want to ensure that the good people of lancashire mr speaker be look after as we would all hope and expect 
 i look forward to see that in chorley 
 i warmly welcome what my right hon friend say last week about encourage research on lobular breast cancer and i look forward to meet the under secretary of state for health and social care   the hon member for lewes maria caulfield shortly to work out how we can operationalise what be her clear ambition 
 i thank my right hon friend and my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison   for bring amazing woman to talk to i about the impact of lobular cancer for the benefit of members on both side of the house last week we send out a dear colleague letter and graphic about the woman ’s health strategy so that we can all help our constituent to understand what this conservative government be do to ensure that the healthcare of woman be fast simple and fairer 
 overnight at my order the royal air force engage in a wave of strike against houthi military target in yemen we do so because we continue to see for instance in intelligence an ongoing and imminent threat from the houthis to uk commercial and military vessel and to those of our partner in the red sea and the wide region 
 i tell the house last week that we would not hesitate to respond if the act continue in order to protect innocent life and preserve the freedom of navigation and that be what we have do we act alongside the united states with support from australia bahrain canada and the netherlands we act on the same basis as on   january fully in line with international law in self defence and in response to a persistent threat and and as with the wave the strike be limit to carefully select target with maximum care take to protect civilian life 
 attempt to counter every houthi attack after it have be launch be simply not sustainable we have already shoot down dozen of missile and drone target at civilian vessel and at the royal navy and the houthis have conduct at least further attack on shipping since   january include just last night shortly before our strike be conduct so we act to far degrade their ability to mount such attack 
 last week i give the house our initial assessment of the wave of strike since then we have see further evidence that they be successful in degrade the houthis military capability last night we hit military site just north of sana’a each contain multiple specific target which the houthis use to support their attack on shipping 
 i want to be very clear we be not seek a confrontation we urge the houthis and those who enable they to stop these illegal and unacceptable attack but if necessary the united kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self defence we can not stand by and allow these attack to go unchallenged inaction be also a choice with that in mind and give the persistent nature of the threat it be important to update the house again today i listen carefully to right hon and hon member last week and we will give the house a chance for a full debate on our broad approach in the red sea tomorrow 
 we take extensive step to address this threat to international security before take military action we launch operation prosperity guardian in december with over other country the international community issue repeat statement on   december   december   january   and   january   condemn the attack and urge the houthis to desist on   january the united nations security council pass a resolution demand that they stop the attack i think it be important to note that the internationally recognise government of yemen have also condemn the houthis for their action accuse they of 
 create a conflict for propaganda 
 serve only their own selfish end 
 as we see in the house last week member be rightly keen to hear how this situation can be bring to an end the answer must include the vital right to self defence when we be attack but that be only part of our wide response which i want to say more about today we be increase our diplomatic engagement because we recognise the deep concern about and the complexity of the current situation i speak to president biden about these issue last night the foreign secretary will be in the region in the come day and he meet his iranian counterpart last week he make it clear that they must cease supply the houthis with weapon and intelligence and use their influence to stop houthi attack 
 secondly we must end the illegal flow of arm to the houthi militia we have intercept weapon shipment in the region before include component of the very missile use by the houthis today this bring home the importance of maritime security in the region and it include work closely with our ally and partner to disrupt and deter the supply of weapon and component 
 thirdly we will use the most effective mean at our disposal to cut off the houthis financial resource where they be use to fund these attack we be work closely with the us on this and plan to announce new sanction measure in the come day 
 fourthly we need to keep help the people of yemen who have suffer so terribly as a result of the country ’s civil war we will continue to deliver humanitarian aid and to support a negotiate peace in that conflict not just because it be the right thing to do but because we need to show the people of yemen that we have no quarrel with they as the yemeni government understand this be our strategy and we will keep all other tool under close review as well 
 i repeat that there be no link between our action of self defence in the red sea and the situation in israel and gaza those who make that link do the houthis work for they and i want to be clear that those here at home who glorify the houthis attack be glorify terrorism plain and simple they will be meet with a tolerance approach all of that say i would like to address the situation in israel and gaza directly because it remain at the forefront of member mind president biden and i discuss this again yesterday and he share my deep concern about the situation and the terrible suffering and loss of civilian life so together we be work to establish a new aid route through the port of ashdod 
 the uk want to see an end to the fighting in gaza as soon as possible we be call for an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostage out as a vital step towards build a sustainable permanent ceasefire without a return to destruction fighting and loss of life to achieve that hamas must agree to the release of all hostage they can no long be in charge of gaza the threat from hamas terror and rocket attack must end and an agreement must be in place for the palestinian authority to return to gaza to provide governance service and security that pathway to peace should unite the whole house i believe we be also unite in support of a state solution 
 through all the complexity of the current situation our principle hold firm resolute in the face of threat compassionate in support of those in need and determine in maintain stability security and the rule of law   that be what our ally and partner have come to expect from the united kingdom and that be what we stand for 
 i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for the advance copy of his statement 
 labour say that we will judge further action against the houthis on a case by case basis so let i be clear that we back this targeted action to reinforce maritime security in the red sea the houthi attack must stop they be design to destabilise we so we must stand united and strong they bring danger to ordinary civilian work hard at sea so we must protect those civilian and they aim to disrupt the flow of good food and medicine so we must not let they go unaddresse 
 the professionalism and bravery of those serve on hms diamond and fly raf typhoons be both totally accept and completely remarkable without they britain can not be a force for good in the world 
 this be of course the set of strike in which the uk have participate the stated aim of the set be to deter and degrade houthi capability but we now know that their attack have continue while we do not question the justification for action it be right that the house hear more about its effectiveness labour of course recognise that strike can reduce threat without eliminate it and we recognise that military action be just component of a wide diplomatic strategy none the less i ask the prime minister to set out his confidence that these strike will be effective in reduce houthi capability as the situation have evolve although we of course understand the clear legal basis for these action will the prime minister commit to restate and republish the government ’s legal position 
 alongside the uk and the us other country have provide non operational support for these strike and maritime protection in the red sea many more support the united nations security council resolution that utterly condemn the houthi attack what work be be do to hold together that coalition and if possible to enlarge it the action that the uk take must draw on the support of all those who care about international law give the special role that the uk play in yemen will the prime minister set out the concrete step in addition to those in his statement that we be take to help the people of yemen who have suffer terribly as a result of that country ’s civil war 
 the international community can not allow itself to be divide which be exactly what the houthi backer in tehran would love to see on that note can the prime minister update the house on whether his government have give further consideration to the proscription of the islamic revolutionary guard corps we need every tool at our disposal to disrupt irgc activity and we must show iran that it can not pursue its end by destabilise the entire region 
 like the prime minister i totally reject the houthi claim that attack ship from around the world be somehow link to the conflict in gaza these attack do absolutely nothing for the palestinian people what be need in gaza be a humanitarian truce now a    sustainable ceasefire to stop the killing of innocent civilian space for the return of all hostage urgent humanitarian relief and a decisive step towards a state solution palestinian statehood be the inalienable right of the palestinian people it be not in the gift of a neighbour do the prime minister agree that a secure israel alongside a viable palestinian state be the only path to a just and last peace we must stop those who sow division we must do what we can to disrupt and deter the houthis and we must stay united and steadfast in defence of our value our security and our right to self defence labour will always act in the national interest and we provide our full support for these necessary and proportionate strike 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for his statement and his support i be grateful to he for that he raise all the right question about the action today which i be happy to answer 
 the right hon and learn gentleman ask about the effectiveness of strike in deter and precisely degrading capability i be pleased to tell he that further evidence after the initial statement i make last week have demonstrate to we that the strike last week be effective in degrading capability and all the intended target be destroy i be also pleased to say that our initial evidence from last night ’s strike be also that all intend target be destroy which demonstrate to we that work with our ally who have the same view the strike be work to degrade capability even though as the right hon and learn gentleman say there may be a difference between reduce and eliminate we be confident that what we be do be work to degrade capability the target be specifically select on the basis of intelligence they be military site that impact the security and safety of seafarer and shipping to that end i be confident that as i say the strike be be carry out in a way that be effective in achieve their aim 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman for acknowledge that the strike sit within a wide strategy in the region to bring about an end to what we be see the foreign secretary will be in the region this week engage extensively with our partner and ally on all the topic that the right hon and learn gentleman raise and particularly ensure that we can continue to make progress on a sustainable peace in yemen no doubt the foreign secretary will talk to our saudi partner about that and crucially broaden the coalition of support for the action we have take 
 as i point to in my statement multiple statement have be make by a wide coalition of country from around the world in support of action the right hon and learn gentleman can rest assure that we be continue to expand that coalition of support because the security of navigation and shipping impact all country wherever they might be not just in the red sea all of we have see the consequence of the war in ukraine on energy bill across the european continent and beyond so i think people be very alive to the interconnectedness of the global economy and the importance of protect freedom of navigation everywhere 
 on the legal advice my understanding be that we have publish or be imminently about to publish a summary of the legal advice i can happily give the right hon and learn gentleman that confirmation   i can also confirm to he that the basis for action remain the same as it be last time but an update to that effect have be publish or will shortly be publish by the attorney general 
 lastly i will touch on the right hon and learn gentleman ’s broad point he be right to highlight the malign influence of iran in the region obviously we do not comment on ongoing decision or process relate to the proscription of organisation but he can rest assure that we be alive to the risk and work closely with our ally particularly the united states and our european ally to jointly work out the most effective way of counter that influence as i have say the foreign secretary speak to his counterpart last week and we will continue to use all measure at our disposal to protect ourselves we pass the national security act here in the uk and have already sanction the irgc in its entirety 
 more generally on the specific action we have take i again thank the right hon and learn gentleman for his support we have take limited proportionate and i believe necessary action in self defence we will always reserve the right to do that to protect innocent life and freedom of navigation our desire outcome of course be for the houthis to desist and to de escalate the situation what they be do be unacceptable and illegal and the onus should be on they to stop it but we will use all lever at our disposal include diplomacy and sanction to achieve that objective 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i welcome what my right hon friend say about diplomatic and humanitarian effort and indeed cut off the supply of arm i particularly welcome what he say about the effectiveness of the strike that have already take place however do he agree that in order to protect civilian shipping this may need to be a prolonged and persistent target campaign alongside our ally 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question i want to be absolutely clear that no decision have be take to embark on a sustained campaign of the nature that he mention these be limited strike specifically in response to threat that we perceive but we do reserve the right to take action in self defence as i have say crucially the military action be just part of a broad strategy include diplomacy sanction and other thing we will use all lever to bring about an end to the disruption and the illegality that the houthis be cause 
 i call the leader of the scottish national party 
 freedom of navigation be not a choice it be a necessity not least because of the impact there could be on all the people we be very fortunate to represent as such as a point of principle it be fair for the government to use proportionate and robust action to defend that right to freedom of navigation however all of we in this chamber need   to be mindful of the opponent that we face in this   regard the houthis have be under almost constant bombardment from saudi arabia for the good part of   year they do not get that message so why be we so confident that they will get our message this time around 
 that of course lead to the wide question what be the ultimate strategy go forward in relation not just to the houthis but to the wide region over the past week we have see missile strike in iran iraq lebanon pakistan syria and of course yemen in the meantime we continue to see the complete destruction of gaza and of course hamas continue to obtain hostage we need to understand the government ’s strategy to calm water not just in the red sea but right across the region surely that must begin with a ceasefire in gaza 
 as difficult as the situation be to do nothing would also be a choice i believe that would be the wrong choice because it would be tantamount to ceding control of a global economically vital shipping route to a dangerous militant group that be back by iran and it would put innocent life at risk the hon gentleman be right that the military action should sit within a broad strategy which hopefully he can tell from my statement we be engage in on all front 
 on the hon gentleman ’s point about israel and gaza as i have make clear no want to see this conflict go on for a moment long than necessary an immediate pause be necessary to get aid in and hostage out that be what we have be call for the good outcome will be move from that pause to a sustainable ceasefire but as i be clear about in my statement a number of thing need to happen for that to be possible include the release of all the hostage by hamas hamas no long be in charge in gaza and an agreement for the palestinian authority to return to gaza to provide governance that be a conversation we have be have and we will continue to push for that because i believe that will be the good outcome and it be that be widely support by i would imagine everyone in this house 
 just to help the house some people be late and we be only go to run this for an hour so please try to help each other by be as quick as you can i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 i welcome the airstrike which be conduct solely to re establish freedom of maritime movement however there be a number of iranian proxy and ally group operate across the middle east and the hand of iran be clear in their activity iran be the fundamental threat to uk security and to stability in the region what be the strategic approach and intent to comprehensively reduce the threat that we face from all the proxy and ally so that we do not end up play whack a mole have we see any opportunism from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or daesh who be also on the ground in iran finally as the prime minister touch on gaza israel please may i reiterate my request for the uk to launch a contact group for palestine so that we can launch track negotiation to get some progress towards stability and a state solution 
 the behaviour of the iranian regime include the action of the irgc pose a significant threat to the safety and security of the   united kingdom and our ally particularly give iran ’s direct threat against people here in the uk as well as its destabilising influence in the region we be alive to the threat which be why we have already sanction more than iranian individual include the irgc in its entirety the national security act provide new measure for our police and security service to counter the hostile influence that we see 
 the foreign secretary speak to his iranian counterpart last week and we will continue that diplomacy this week as i point out in my statement we have previously interdict the supply of iranian missile be smuggle to the houthis last year and the year before we need to ensure that we work with our ally to do that because the flow of those weapon to the houthis be critical to their ability to carry out these attack work with our ally we should try to do everything we can to stop that 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrat party 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement as i make clear last week the liberal democrats accept the case for limited strike against the houthis as long as they remain limited as the prime minister update the house for the time on this matter there be remarkably little clarity about what the next step be and when the uk ’s objective will be judge to have be fulfil nor have the prime minister sufficiently address how he plan to avoid regional escalation in this most fragile of region i thank he for agree that the house can debate this matter tomorrow but will he not give the house the opportunity to vote on this matter not least give the huge cross party support for limited strike that would surely strengthen the signal he intend to give 
 what be escalatory be the houthis ramp up attack on commercial shipping launch missile and drone against us and uk warship and threaten ally basis in the region i have be very clear that military action be a last resort we provide warning after warning include with ally and at the un security council the houthis have and continue to have the ability to prevent this by stop their illegal attack as i point out early there be also risk to inaction because it would damage international security and the global economy and send a message that british vessel life and interest be fair game none of which i think be acceptable 
 i be pleased that the house will have an opportunity to debate the matter tomorrow but as i say we reserve the right to take action in a limited proportionate and legal way in self defence that be the right thing and the country would expect nothing less from the government 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement and action on the issue of iran can he say what contingency planning have be do in the eventuality that houthi attack in the red sea be follow up by irgc attack in the persian gulf 
 my right hon friend be right to point out the link between iran and the houthis we be alive to that and i discuss it with president biden last   night my right hon friend will know that we have asset in the region and we be work closely with our ally to ensure maritime security whether that be by interdict arm or more generally ensure the freedom of navigation diplomacy will also have to play a part which be why the foreign secretary ’s conversation with his iranian counterpart be so important but we remain alive to the risk and will do everything we can to reduce they 
 the prime minister be right that to do nothing be not an option but to do something there need to be a strategy if the attack continue and there be continued disruption to maritime trade do he have a plan b 
 that be why we be work extensively with our ally broaden the international coalition of support condemn the houthis behaviour and put pressure on they in all different way it be important that military action be not see in isolation it sit alongside wide diplomatic and economic strategy as i say we will bring forward new sanction measure together with our ally in the come day 
 i express my full support for the action that my right hon friend the prime minister have approve will he extend his strategic objective because it seem that this threat will remain so long as the houthis have a safe haven to operate from it be a question of how we deal with that part of yemen which be effectively an ungoverned space 
 it be clear that the houthis behaviour be damage the people of yemen we have talk previously about the importance of the supply of food into yemen but the destruction of oil infrastructure also deprive the yemeni people of key revenue these be all topic with which we be engage with our saudi partner we very much support the negotiation as my hon friend know a deal be announce in december we would like to see a last peace and security for the yemeni people for an inclusive political settlement and i can assure he that diplomatically we be work very hard to achieve that aim
