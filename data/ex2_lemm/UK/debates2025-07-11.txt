 consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee 
 before we come to our proceeding i remind member of the difference between report and reading the scope of debate on report be the   amendment i have select the scope of the reading debate to follow will be the whole bill as it stand after report member may wish to consider those point before decide at which stage or stage they want to try to catch my eye

 at the end of the period of month begin with the day on which it be pass 
 many people watch and observe proceeding in parliament will wonder whether we have our priority right the bill be about unauthorised entry to football match in particular circumstance but i think most people be much more concerned about the proliferation of unauthorised entry into our very country and the failure of the home office and its official to do anything effective about it in my submission the bill be a trivialisation of legislation by home office official who should be do other thing but i will not dwell on that now mr speaker 
 the long title of the bill state that its purpose be to 
 create an offence of unauthorised entry at football match for which a football ban order can be impose follow conviction 
 however it be about not just unauthorised entry but any attempt at unauthorised entry my amendment be design to exclude from the bill provision relate to attempt to enter such attempt be less important than actual unlawful entry and to include they in the same category be disproportionate and unreasonable when we come on to debate other part of the bill on reading point can be make about the bill more generally but it seem to i that someone attempt to enter a football match without authorisation should not be subject to the same penalty as set out in the bill as people who actually succeed in get into a football match 
 actually   july   be quite an interesting date on this very day year ago the euros final at wembley stadium result in the unauthorised entry of thousand of fan which cause a lot of disorder baroness casey who be an expert on produce report be commission by the football association to look into that issue and come forward with recommendation in her report   which span more than page she emphasise the fact that much of the disorder be nothing to do with people come in without ticket and tailgating in fact a lot of it be attribute to other failure to enforce the law in particular the taking of drug and alcohol on public transport in london which be verboten and the taking of drug in the vicinity of a football match which should also be forbid but be allow to proceed with impunity she also make the point that unlike at many football match what happen at wembley be largely exacerbate by the inadequacy of the stewarding arrangement 
 as a result of baroness casey ’s report the home office decide to bring forward this bill however nowhere could i find in the report any reference to the fact that baroness casey want to treat attempt to enter in exactly the same way as enter which be why i have put forward these amendment there be no need to expand on that except to say that it be in common law normally an attempt to commit a criminal offence be an inchoate action which can itself be the subject of criminal proceeding in those circumstance there would be no need to have this provision write into the bill 
 it seem to i that the provision would create a penalty that be quite severe it could affect people ’s ability to go and watch football match for many year into the future the presumption under the bill as you will know mr speaker be that if someone be guilty of an offence they will be unable to go to football match again as a spectator my assessment be that that be disproportionate and unnecessary for those reason i strongly oppose this aspect of the bill and seek through these amendment to remove reference to attempt 
 amendment be another example of where we need to try to tighten up private member bills when they be bring before this house so that the government do not have everything their own way member will know that there be other bills to be debate on report this morning all those other bills have a commencement date but clause 2(2 of this bill say 
 this act come into force on such day as the secretary of state may by regulation make by statutory instrument appoint 
 the question i ask be why why be that necessary why can we not in this very simple bill say that these provision will come into effect either on the day of royal assent or within month of that date that would be the norm 
 what sometimes happen of course be that the government give themselves power and do all the talk about support bills such as this and then never bring forward the regulation the consequence of not have a specific timetable be that the ball be very much to use that expression in the government ’s court because they can decide whether they will implement the provision of this bill which have be put forward by the home office i hope that when the minister respond to this debate he will explain why the bill have to be introduce by regulation on a date yet to be specify of course the making of regulation be in itself a far unnecessary administrative burden i would be interested to hear from the minister as to why the bill be be treat differently from the other bills the government be hop will get through today 
 i rise to thank   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for his careful consideration of my bill although i be somewhat sadden by his suggestion that this be a trivial matter as he himself go on to say we see scene at the carabao cup final that be very troubling and warrant a full report from baroness casey she make an excellent report with some very good observation and recommendation indeed she say that there should be a deterrent effect to any recommendation that be bring in i submit that the bill provide just that 
 i also rise to oppose amendment to on amendment to and the issue of attempt entry attempt entry place a particular pressure on stadium security and often require police involvement it be often extremely crowded outside stadium with scuffle struggle and chase through the crowd when people try to enter without a ticket include attempt entry allow law enforcement to act before the breach of a stadium occur and that provide an additional level of security 
 i be at the carabao cup final this year my right hon friend the minister for policing and crime prevention and i be take down to the turnstile with the police we witness tailgate almost immediately we also see an attempt tailgating incident which involve a man in his 70 or early 80 stand at the turnstile shout to the steward for help and assistance because somebody behind he be try to push their way into the ground it be frightening for he he stand his ground i pay tribute to he for do so but it could have be dangerous indeed it be dangerous with the amount of people who be around 
 i submit that it fly in the face of common sense to release people who have a clear intention to get into a stadium the police tell i that those sort of attempt be make repeatedly time and time again at the moment the police do not have the power to arrest they they detain they but then have to release they people just go back and try to get in again it be a constant cat and mouse as it be and throughout that period people be put in danger from that action to omit the offence of attempt entry would take we no far from the current position that the police find themselves in include attempt in the bill give the good chance of equip the police to deal with this issue and keep everybody as safe as they possibly can 
 on amendment regard a timescale my understanding be that the bill be design to come into force via regulation so that that can be align with the start of the football calendar that will ensure that all relevant organisation have time to prepare co ordinate and train accordingly as a crown prosecutor for year before i come to this place i understand at hand the importance of allow sufficient time for change in legislation to be implement for staff to be train and for proper resource to be put in place by the police the crown prosecution service and most importantly by the stadium themselves 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for give way and for the diligence with which she have approach this subject include have discuss it on several occasion with i she say that instead of a date be specify in the bill regulation will be pass to bring in the provision at the beginning of the football season when be that be there a particular date 
 i perhaps misspoke my understanding be that it be to align with the football calendar rather than the start of the season perhaps the minister can clarify that in due course we be now on a countdown to the start of the football season my husband be a season ticket holder for coventry city fc be very disappointed that we will be on holiday at the start of the football season in august obviously it be unlikely that we will get the provision in place by then but the important thing be to get the legislation in place in time for when we co host the next european final which be in i think we should be in good time for that a fix date of month after royal assent would be sufficient time to get everything in place 
 as i mention early the bill have a deterrent element to it baroness casey ’s recommendation be to make sure that it be a proper deterrent we need to be ready and we need to make sure that as soon as the legislation kick off we send a clear message that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerate any long and people will not be able to get away with it i hope i have provide a thorough and detailed response that satisfy the hon member for christchurch and i respectfully urge he to withdraw his amendment 
 i rise to support my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope it seem to i that the way that he introduce his very modest amendment to remove the word attempt be entirely proper i support the bill but i think it be quite dangerous to introduce an offence into criminal law of just attempt to enter a football ground because it be quite difficult to gather evidence of or police that 
 i assure   the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth   that i do not want to delay matter much i will keep my remark short because i support the general principle of the bill i support make it a criminal offence to actually enter a designate football match that be in the bill ’s long title and be something we can all agree on widen the scope of the bill to include attempt to enter a ground be quite dangerous 
 i assume that the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch will be reject but i wonder whether it would unduly weaken the bill if they be pass after all the bill be about have a legal deterrent to crowd of people seek to force their way into a football ground but there may be many other way in which people attempt to get into a football ground that be not riotous disorder and may be quite honest in intention 
 when create criminal law it be dangerous to get into aspect of intention men rea as lawyer call it rather than in this case the actual legal fact of enter a football ground if the law be not change someone engage in this bad behaviour could be punish only by ejection from the stadium but there be criminal law of trespass and many other way in which this very bad behaviour can be identify when baroness casey identify in her review the absence of specific offence as a weakness in stadium enforcement i be not sure whether she be refer to such minor infringement as attempt to enter a football ground i will say more about that in a moment 
 i know that the key motivation for the bill be the euro final and the chaos at wembley when hundred of ticketless individual storm the venue overwhelmed steward and endanger legitimate fan that mass unauthorised entry pose real risk but that be really a riot that be quite a different situation from somebody on their own or perhaps a father with his child attempt to get into a football ground when they may not have a ticket they may have be mi sell a ticket they may believe that they have a genuine ticket they may have be sell at vast cost a ticket by a ticket tout but apparently now they will face the full force of the criminal law 
 under the bill police and court will be able to ban repeat offender as it make offender eligible for football ban order those be quite serious consequence for people who may not be rioter at all they may just be genuine football fan we be talk about a fine of up to £ and a trial in a magistrate court i know that such case will not go to a crown court but that be still a very serious matter for somebody who might just be attempt to enter a place 
 we will be tell by the bill ’s supporter that its enforcement be practical i understand how entry into a football ground could be enforce but i be unsure about enforce an attempt to get into a football ground surely police and steward need clarity there be no point in we introduce more and more law when we have a whole slate of traditional law against riotous behaviour law that may be difficult to enforce just bring the whole system into disrepute 
 i know that football club police force and fan organisation largely support the bill but i be not sure whether they be aware just how widely it be frame i be sure that if they could talk these matter through with my hon friend they would think his amendment be a wise and moderate compromise because people already assume that it be an offence to enter a football ground without a ticket i agree that the bill remove the gap between assumption and reality 
 the other thing that slightly worry i be that while i can quite understand how such attempt could be deal with by a premier league club which have steward and the whole panoply of a large football club we should consider small club such as gainsborough trinity fc in my constituency these small club have face huge challenge and we be just introduce more burden on they during covid gainsborough suspend season ticket and capped attendance at just 
 small club already have to deal with many regulation and with public health their finance be very marginal and covid worsen already fragile financial situation i hope that when we consider these undoubtedly worthy bills as we look at the euros wembley and all the rest of it that impose more obligation on football club we remember small club 
 the football association be not always as helpful as it can be with small club big club get attention and support so it may well be possible for they to police attempt to enter but it may be more difficult for a tiny club a very worthy important and wonderful club such as gainsborough trinity fc to deal with the intricacy of the law and understand it 
 we be talk about enforcement and police resource and therefore the measure in the bill should be very moderate there would be £ fine or long ban   order be we go to drag people before the court i have already talk about the father attempt an entry could child or young people who sneak in without harmful intent face have a criminal record be we really go to do that be that the sort of country we want to create 
 we do not have a lot of datum on how many attempt there be or how much unauthorised entry there be we should acknowledge that the euro final be exceptional it be unclear whether make this kind of permanent legislative change and reject the amendment will solve the problem 
 on the datum the fa report that approximately people regularly attempt to tailgate at match at wembley and other competitive game at ground across the country it be not the odd person every now and again people be regularly try over and over again to get into football ground that be why it be important that attempt be include do the right hon gentleman recognise that 
 the hon lady make a fair point but i be make a point about small club we be here because of a political reaction to the embarrassment create by major failure but we can not base good law on major failure that be on all our television screen we have to look at all club and consider all the difficulty that they would have in implement this change 
 there be a big issue with attempt tailgating to avoid pay fare on the london underground what do my right hon friend think about the bill in comparison with what be happen on the underground 
 we know that there be an epidemic of lawlessness on the underground and elsewhere no doubt somebody will try to bring in a bill on that as well and good luck to they but we be talk about a very narrow amendment and a narrowly focused bill 
 i be worried about enforcement which may vary between club or region fan may lose trust if they see the law be apply unevenly and i do not know how club will police these attempt it be unclear whether ban order will lead to frequent appeal people would be try just for an attempt i know that that would only be in the magistrate court but if they face long ban order could there be appeal we have to apply the law fairly and reasonably otherwise it risk be a blunt instrument surely we should try to make this sort of bill tightly focus 
 the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch be sensible they would well tool the legislation towards its rightful end they focus on the actual harm by remove attempt entry from the offence the amendment would criminalise only complete unauthorised entry clear fact that can be understand and prove we should target behaviour that truly compromise safety and public order 
 secondly the amendment would ensure that the bill avoid over criminalisation criminalise failed or minor   attempt could lead to disproportionate outcome especially for young people or time offender my hon friend ’s amendment promote a more measured legal response 
 thirdly the amendment would reduce ambiguity and the great danger in law be ambiguity attempted entry be a vague standard and may vary in interpretation by steward and police if hon member try to imagine the policing of a crowded football match with people pour in i wonder whether they would start to agree that attempt entry be a vague standard and may vary in interpretation we be talk about the criminal law we be talk not just about somebody be tick off or tell they can not enter the stadium but possibly end up in court the amendment would give a clear legal threshold for enforcement and prosecution on the basis of which somebody can be try and sentence in the court 
 fourthly my hon friend ’s amendment would protect civil liberty i have spend many long year and friday in this place defend civil liberty i do not believe   in over regulation and ever more law restrict civil liberty the amendment would guard against penalise individual where intent or context be unclear we be criminalise only intent we be not criminalise an actual fact and that be a dangerous legal proposition if we start do it now on this bill where will it stop will we criminalise an attempt to enter a cinema or theatre 
 order the right hon gentleman be stray a little wide into different area as he rightly say the bill be quite narrow i be sure that he will want to get back on track this be about football not cinema 
 i be so grateful to you mr speaker you will be grateful to hear that have make those remark i be draw to a conclusion 
 we have a duty to ensure that punishment be base on actual misconduct in enter a football ground not suspicion or misjudged behaviour fifthly my hon friend ’s amendment would allow for practical enforcement focus on complete unauthorised entry would help police and club concentrate their resource on the most serious breach rather than chase marginal case the amendment would provide necessary implementation time the month delay before commencement give football club police and steward time to prepare for the new legal framework reduce confusion and aid smooth enforcement 
 finally the amendment would encourage propor tionality they keep the law from become an unnecessarily blunt instrument and instead preserve a proportionate target response to genuine request 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank   the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth   for bring the bill forward and my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for his amendment at this stage be it correct that you wish we to speak only to the amendment mr speaker   interruption yes we the opposition have nothing furth to add to the debate that we have have this morning 
 i call the minister 
 i thank   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for table these amendment which propose change amendment to would remove attempt unauthorised entry from the scope of the offence secondly amendment would bring the act into force month after it receive royal assent rather than by commencement regulation make by statutory instrument 
 it be absolutely essential that the bill explicitly cover both attempt and successful unauthorised entry we have see widespread issue involve ticketless fan at football match attempt to force entry and tailgate at high profile match include the champion league final premier league fixture and at the euro tournament these form of attempt entry place significant demand   on stadium safety and security personnel and at time require police intervention maintain provision for attempt unauthorised entry ensure that law enforcement can act before a breach occur and thus maintain safety and security at football match across the country it also enable the imposition of preventive football ban order against person involve in attempt entry ban order be an effective deterrent against those who may seek to compromise public safety 
 i turn to amendment the bill be design to allow the measure to come into force by regulation on a date shortly before the start of the domestic football season this approach will ensure that all organisation involve in safety and security operation be prepare to implement the new offence a fix date month after royal assent may not coincide with the football calendar or allow sufficient time for training communication and co ordination i therefore respectfully ask the hon member for christchurch to withdraw his amendment 
 the minister say that the bill will come into force before the start of the football season we hear from   the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth   that the season will start pretty soon within or week i assume that mean the bill will not be implement until summer that be the clear implication of what the minister say if i be wrong in that interpretation i hope he will intervene because it be important to get it on the record that the bill will not be in force until a year ’s time 
 on the issue of attempt listen to my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh i think that i have under egg the pudding a bit because he adduce a whole lot of extra argument that reinforce the case for remove attempt from the bill apart from anything else i fear that if we allow attempt to remain in the bill the people who be still outside the stadium and never get in will be the easy picking they will be the one who get arrest and penalise while the mass of offender who get in without authority will get away with it because in order for any of this to work there have to be an arrest and a subsequent prosecution i wish to test the will of the house in relation to amendment 
 question put that the amendment be make 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 it be an honour to stand in the chamber today and present this bill for its reading particularly as a lifelong football fan i put on record that i be a proud everton supporter my staff have all too gleefully remind i that this may be the near thing to football relate success that i experience for a long time our man ’s team last win a major trophy in and the woman ’s in so i be sure member can imagine my delight when i see the amber valley codnor sapphire girl under-10s team win the plate in a tournament in heanor last sunday i be tell that other team from my constituency sleetmoor under-13s lady and heanor junior hawks also win trophy that day i live in hope that everton can follow suit and get their hand on some silverware at our new ground next season 
 football have a rich and impressive history it bridge community and bring people together cut across generational gender base geographical cultural and class divide it be a sport of opportunity and hope that see girl and boy who begin by play on the street of their home town become superstar and role model with platform from which they can enact real change as we see during covid with marcus rashford ’s free school meal campaign the rule of modern football be think to have be draw up in not far from   this place at the freemason tavern in london there among other thing the somewhat important rule that carry the ball with hand be not allow be agree on sadly the referee seem to forget that in the infamous world cup quarter final between argentina and england in which maradona produce his hand of god moment the introduction of the video assistant referee mean that today such a goal would rightly be rule out not that we england fan be bitter 
 as these example show football be in a constant state of change and evolution it be not only right that as the sport evolve and progress the regulation around it adapt to reflect and facilitate those change it be paramount that bring i to my bill which consider the issue of unauthorised entry to football match from a fan safety perspective it aim to ensure that proper legislation be in place to protect fan and prevent overcrowding in stadium as we have hear unauthorised entry often take the form of tailgating also call jib that be where a ticketless person push through the turnstile behind an unsuspecting ticket hold fan currently if catch tailgater will likely be eject without face any other consequence therefore ticketless individual can and do repeatedly attempt to gain entry to a match until they give up or be successful 
 this be not a trivial matter it have significant consequence for the fan in the stadium and for the steward and security staff work there accord to the football association unauthorised entry to football match result in operational safety and security problem at major event there be regularly tailgate attempt at major game at wembley and at ground across the country occasionally there be also instance of mass entry where large crowd of people try to push their way into the stadium the potential consequence of this kind of mass entry be both dangerous and tragic 
 in july during the euros final around ticketless individual enter wembley stadium it be estimate that around to of those individual get into the inner area of the ground of my friend ross and siobhan be at the match that day they be both extremely experienced supporter of many sport and travel to attend game at many ground around the world they be excited that day to watch the game to experience at hand the charge atmosphere of such a significant match and to get behind their team unfortunately they do not have the usual experience that they rightly hop for siobhan tell i 
 we arrive wembley around an hour before kick off it be obvious that thing be not as they should be i feel very uneasy about the atmosphere we go to the turnstile which be still very busy and there be people there without a ticket who have manage to get through the ticket check and be ask people to let they push through with they i’ve be to many event at wembley that be sell out and have never see it in such a mess we go straight to our seat which we be able to reclaim from the people occupy they at the time and the row be overfill and the stairway be full of people the place be clearly fill way past capacity overall i find it to be unpleasant and a potentially dangerous environment it have put i off attend england game and i have not be to since 
 my friend be not alone in feel like that baroness louise casey be commission to conduct an independent review into the event of the euros final which she describe as turn 
 a day of national pride into a day of shame 
 the report find 
 the drunkenness drug taking irresponsibility criminality and abuse of innocent people include staff family and disabled ticket holder be shocking and intolerable 
 baroness casey also write 
 there be a series of crowd near miss which could have lead to significant injury or even death 
 she conclude 
 the exist enforcement mechanism available to the police and other enforcement officer do not offer enough deterrent against those determined to use the cover of football match to commit criminal offence tailgate for example should become a criminal offence sanction for those break into football stadium and/or recklessly endanger life be weak 
 my bill aim to rectify that by insert a new specific offence into the football offences act namely enter or attempt to enter a designate football match in england and wales without a ticket that the person be eligible to use the offence as we have hear be summary only and carry a maximum sentence of a £ fine it can be try only in a magistrate court which will help with the big core backlog in the crown court a conviction be likely to lead to a court impose football ban order prevent the person in question attend match for between and year there be a potential prison sentence if the ban order be breach 
 the offence and the ban order in particular be intend to act as the long term deterrent that baroness casey identify a need for in her report if pass the bill would apply to match set out in order make under section of the act as it stand those be match in the premier league championship league and national league woman ’s super league woman ’s super league previously call the championship and cymru premier league and international fixture hold in england and wales 
 after i do an interview with radio derby about the bill i be touch to hear from my friend and amber valley borough council ’s long serve councillor john mccabe incidentally he be also probably of the long suffer nottingham forest football club fan he have sadly pass away since he leave i a voicemail message that morning which i still have he open with his characteristic greeting ey up linsey before talk about unauthorised entry in his youth he say 
 well do it ’ be happen for year it use to happen when i be about they use to say lift he over he ’ll be alright but it ’ be happen for year that linsey 
 that well do stick with i and his word and reflection on witness unauthorised entry age far demonstrate the long stand need for the kind of reform that the bill propose 
 i will now turn to some query that be put to i during the bill ’s various stage the bill use the word premise instead of stadium to allow for arrest to be make and prosecution to be bring against people go through the cordon where a ticket would need to be display prevent danger to the stadium itself in committee   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman   raise a concern regard the challenge of electronic ticketing and ticket duplication as a means to illegally provide entry to match i thank he for his concern and assure he that that would be   capture by section of the criminal justice and public order act a provision that cover the unauthorised resale of match ticket commonly refer to as ticket touting 
 also in committee   the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler   ask about the change to the wording of propose new section 1a(3 of the act in the version of the bill promote by lord brennan of canton which fall at the general election the provision outline propose possible defence propose new section 1a(3)(b in my version of the bill have be edit so that it cover case in which a person reasonably believe that they have a ticket for the match but in fact do not that be to ensure that a person who innocently buy a counterfeit ticket be not criminalise under this offence which be specifically about fan safety and prevent overcrowding as before the defence also apply in relation to a person use a genuine ticket that they be not eligible to use for example an adult use a child ’s ticket again because there would already be a reserved seat in the stadium safety would not be an issue with respect to overcrowding the bill it should be clear be about safety and the safeguarding of football fan not villainise genuine supporter 
 the hon member for wimbledon wonder whether that alteration might have the unintended consequence of allow a defence if a person use a ticket that have already be use regardless of whether they have do so deliberately i promise that i would raise that with the home office legal adviser and the office of the parliamentary counsel which i do they confirm that a person attempt to reuse a ticket could not be say to reasonably believe that they possess valid authorisation to enter mean that the statutory defence under propose new section 1a(3)(b would not apply furthermore in practical term the court be likely to interpret the provision as mean that a person be not eligible to reuse a previously use ticket consistent with the intent to prevent unauthorised access to football stadium i thank the home office legal adviser and the office of the parliamentary counsel for their help in clarify that matter 
 finally let i address why the bill deal with football match specifically of course the danger pose by overcrowding be not limit to football and be prevalent in other highly attend sporting and entertainment event however this be a private member ’s bill and as we have hear in many instance it be good to limit they in nature if be to successfully change the law within the prescribed timeframe 
 i visit wembley to watch the carabao cup final with the minister for policing and crime prevention we witness tailgate take place and when i speak to staff in the police they suggest that football specifically be an event at which unauthorised entry regularly happen and that it pose a serious risk at the most competitive game in the light of the upcoming euro which i be glad to say be be jointly host by the uk and ireland it be necessary that legislation to protect fan be pass as soon as possible so that it can come into effect and be a proper deterrent beforehand if pass my bill guarantee that that would happen 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will make some progress thank you 
 staff at wembley also have concern about upcoming sell out music event it be clear that unauthorised entry and overcrowding could pose security and safety risk beyond football and i hope that parliament will consider legislation that expand the logic of the bill to address those other area include other big music and sport event on another occasion 
 i be pleased to support this bill a lot of the thing i want to say have be highlight by my hon friend   the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth it be clear that the number be stark and there be an issue   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   ask why this legislation be important and i will say why and why it be personal for i 
 on   january teenage boy from the village where i grow up markinch in fife travel to glasgow to watch an old firm game at ibrox they walk together to glenrothes to get on their respective supporter bus of they go on the rangers bus and of they go on the celtic bus only of they come home people lose their life that day in a tragic crush just like hillsborough year later the trauma of that event still reverberate the grief never truly lift for the family for the community or for those who be there the name of ronald paton bryan todd and mason philip who be all aged douglas morrison who be and peter easton who be only be one i grow up with their life and loss be remember by the friend who come home that day shane fenton and peter lee who have dedicate their life to this cause and to remember they 
 those tragedy teach we a painful lesson stadium crush do not start as disaster they begin as overcrowding as bottleneck and as poor control at point of entry and exit the bill will not change the past but it can prevent future risk we can make football what we all want it to be fun about whether your team do well or badly something to talk about with pal it be a part of life but we need to make sure that we keep it safe this be about fairness most fan do exactly the right thing they queue they pay they be search and they have their teeny tiny bag that mean they be not take thing in they deserve a system that do not reward those who flout the rule steward often low pay often young deserve to do their job without be overwhelmed or put at risk by hundred of people surge in unlawfully 
 this bill be not heavy handed it be proportionate and focus i thank my hon friend the member for amber valley for bring it forward and allow i to represent and to record in this chamber the name of those who my community have lose i hope that no other community have to go through that again 
 rise 
 order if member hope to contribute they need to bob throughout i can not read their mind if they only bob towards the end 
 it be a pleasure to serve with you in the chair madam deputy speaker this bill be an improvement on its predecessor and i give credit to   the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth   for that because it allow the defence to which she refer in her early remark and that be well i regret that she would not accept the amendment that would have remove the attempt issue but i must say i be alarmed when she say that she hop the provision in this bill would be replicate more widely in other bills would that be in relation to wimbledon or twickenham it seem to i that the mischief be address in this bill be peculiar to soccer supporter i be not sure about the suggestion that we need to go more widely to deal with this type of hooligan behaviour i declare an interest as a debenture holder at twickenham and i have never experience the sort of problem to which she be refer 
 when i be at university i can remember the football match i ever go to which be at dundee united i stand on the terrace and i do not feel any danger inside the ground the danger in dundee be outside the ground after the event then when i have the privilege of represent southampton itchen i be a frequent visitor to the dell again i do not see any problem there there be problem associate with the need to ensure crowd control and the football club pay dearly for the cost of police to enable that to happen that seem to i a sensible arrangement because the burden of police soccer match be not bear only by the local constabulary and its taxpayer but also by the club itself as baroness casey ’s report make clear the wembley incident that prompt the bill be essentially a off incident cause by a set of different circumstance include that we be still during the period of covid which mean a severe restriction on the number of people who could attend such match other problem be create due to the absence of experienced steward and so on 
 i remember ask the hon member for amber valley why provision in this bill would not be include in the football governance bill which be discuss early in the week she say that although these provision could have be include in that bill because of her legal experience she particularly want to have a bill in her name on the statue book i hope that in the end those dream will be fulfil as that be an important matter for she 
 i have reservation about how this bill will work in practice and i be concern about unintended consequence for the police if there be an incident similar to the that take place at wembley how will we be able to arrest all those people every time somebody be arrest by the police a policeman have to take that person away and put they in a black maria or whatever which mean that they be no long able to police the ground i fear that what will happen be that an individual will be pick on every now and again but when there be a problem of mass trespass we will not be able to do anything about it because nobody will be able to police it we will get a situation similar to the in supermarket with blatant shoplifting and a failure of the police or security people to take any action because they choose not to do so 
 as my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh   say on report there be a danger that bring the criminal law into these area will result in disappointment and as a result bring the law into disrepute we put all these law on the statute book but we can not actually do anything about they as i say early the home office have responsibility for all this but every day we find that it be unable to fulfil its exist responsibility let alone new one that will be place on it as a result of this bill most recently the home office reveal that it be unable even to record the number of people who have enter this country and then leave obviously the way to find out whether people who come in on visa be comply with those visa be to check the visa record when people leave the home office can not even deal with that we be talk about extend its role in the belief that some magic new bill will control unauthorised entry to football stadium when the home office can not even control our country ’s border 
 i be extremely sceptical about this piece of legislation it be a pity in a sense that the private member ’s bill process be give rise to this sort of legislation which be i return to the word i use early relatively trivial compare with all the other problem with which this country be face and with which this legislature should be deal 
 the hon gentleman will correct i if i be wrong but be he say that the safety of those attend football match and the likelihood of they be hurt and in some case kill be a trivial matter 
 there be already law against kill people at football match there be already law against criminal damage there be already law against violent behaviour i do not know whether the hon lady have look at baroness casey ’s report on the incident at wembley in but it say that the issue of tailgating highlight by the hon member for amber valley be not the only problem there be also lot of drunken behaviour 
 indicate dissent 
 the hon lady be shake her head but that be in baroness casey ’s report she find that there be a lot of drunken behaviour and evidence of drug taking those be criminal offence the expression on the hon lady ’s face make it seem as though either she believe that baroness casey ’s finding be incorrect or she have some other reason for disagree with that 
 i think that bring the criminal law into this narrow and specific field when there be already a host of other criminal offence cover these issue be the wrong way forward but i be obviously in the minority on that 
 we will soon find out 
 of course i will give way 
 i have no interest in intervene 
 pardon 
 order a discussion should not be take place while colleague be seat 
 if   the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor   say he have no interest in this bill then he do not have to attend i think he be seek to intervene but he be not he be want to make some sedentary remark 
 i have put on the record my opposition to and scepticism about the content of this bill and i will leave it at that 
 i thank   the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth   for bring the bill forward for many in this chamber the euro final be a rollercoaster of ecstasy and disappointment though i appreciate that certain member from other part of our united kingdom may have feel a little less devastated at the result beyond heartbreak on the pitch the euro final be a day that nearly end in catastrophe thousand of ticketless fan force their way into wembley create chaotic and dangerous scene when disaster be so narrowly avoid it be reasonable to ask whether anybody make a mistake 
 sadly this be not a off incident tailgating be report again at both the champion league final and the league cup final of the arrest make on that day be relate to fraud people try to get in without a ticket we hear from   the hon member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray   about a particularly upsetting and fatal day these incident put genuine fan at risk and erode the trust that be necessary to police event of this scale properly 
 for many people in this country a trip to the football be the highlight of their year for many family it be a hard earn outing or rare treat for their child something they scrimp and save for what must they think when they see hooligan jump the barrier and get in for free they must think that they be the mug for have pay and follow the rule in the place it be therefore right that we give police and organiser the tool they need not just to remove people in the moment but to prevent repeat offence through ban order that build on step take by the previous government that see drug relate offence in football stadium likewise result in stadium ban 
 i welcome the clear focus on intent the defence include in the bill be thorough i hope that the minister can confirm that enforcement will be direct firmly at dangerous deliberate entry and will not affect fan who responsibly pass on spare ticket target common sense enforcement be exactly the right approach to tackle this kind of disorder 
 where new power be necessary the opposition will support their introduction the fa certainly seem to support the introduction of a bespoke offence for tailgating however all too often we do not make enough use of exist power if i understand the sentiment express by my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who be no long in his place he be say that the law introduce in this place be often improperly enforce follow the arrest that i mention early not a single person have be charge   a bespoke tailgate offence will make little difference unless police and the crown prosecution service be willing and able to secure conviction we must support they in do so as well as in take other step such as co operate with stadium to advise on case in which stadium ban might be appropriate 
 more broadly many of we be concern by the rapid erosion of the social contract across our society we be witness a troubling disregard for not only law and order but standard of behaviour whether it be people push through ticket barrier on the tube as my hon friend the member for christchurch mention and my right hon friend   the member for newark robert jenrick   have highlight or migrant work illegally as delivery driver as my right hon friend   the member for croydon south chris philp   have highlight the principle be the same law apply to everyone or they apply only to those of we who be good enough stick to they which be deeply unfair 
 if we do not take action to uphold those standard particularly when safety be at stake public confidence inevitably suffer the starting point must always be the enforcement of our exist law and we must give full support to institution such as the fa as they take step to improve safety and uphold standard 
 in the light of all that i be pleased to reiterate the support express in committee and confirm our continued support for this private member ’s bill i again thank the hon member for amber valley for introduce it 
 i warmly commend my hon friend   the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth   for bring forward this private member ’s bill as a lifelong football supporter she have make a powerful case for her bill and i congratulate she on secure support for it from across the house 
 i thank all hon member who have contribute today in particular my hon friend   the member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray who speak movingly about her experience of these matter my hon friend the member for amber valley speak about the rich history of football 
 the bill address a clear and pressing issue the grow problem of unauthorised access to football match particularly at high profile fixture it do so by create a new football specific offence of unauthorised entry to designate match it capture a wide range of behaviour from tailgate and force entry to the use of forge document or the impersonation of match day staff crucially it will also enable court to impose football ban order on conviction provide a strong deterrent and a vital tool to prevent repeat offend and protect public safety the bill respond directly to the recommendation of baroness casey ’s independent review into the serious disorder at the euro final where thousand of ticketless individual gain access to wembley stadium many through mass force entry or tailgating 
 let i be clear this be a recur problem we see further evidence of it at the uefa champions league final which be again at wembley where group of ticketless fan make repeat attempt to breach security similar behaviour be see at premier league match particularly if away allocation be limited it   be a wide pattern of behaviour that need to be address such behaviour be not only selfish and dishonest but fundamentally dangerous it place enormous strain on stadium security create serious risk to public safety and undermine the experience of law abide fan the government be clear that it can not and will not be allow to continue that be why we support the bill 
 force entry tailgating and so call jibbing be not victimless act those involve be often aggressive violent or threatening and their action can lead to overcrowding block emergency exit and frightening condition for innocent fan in some case individual have even attempt to bribe steward or turnstile operator to gain access that will be capture by the new offence the offence will also apply to those who knowingly attempt to use a ticket whether physical or digital that have already be use 
 let i be clear this be not about criminalise honest mistake or punish fan who have be mislead the bill include important safeguard to ensure that individual with lawful authority such as emergency worker or stadium staff be not catch by the offence and it will not apply to those who unwittingly purchase counterfeit ticket in good faith or breach the term and condition of a legitimate ticket that be a point refer to by the father of the house   the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and by the shadow minister   the hon member for weald of kent katie lam i agree with the point she make about enforcement 
 this be a proportionate targeted and necessary measure it reflect the unique public order challenge associate with football which be not see to the same extent in other sport or event it be also consistent with the broad framework of the football offences act and the football spectators act the bill have enjoy cross party support throughout its passage and rightly so it be a fan friendly measure that protect the vast majority of decent supporter from the action of a disruptive minority and it will help to ensure that football remain a safe and welcoming environment for all i once again thank my hon friend the member for amber valley for her excellent work on this bill and i commend it to the house 
 with the leave of the house i associate myself with the tribute to the ibrox victim give so movingly by my hon friend   the member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray 
 there be many people i would like to thank for help to get the bill to this stage but i will speak about footballer vice captain and much love daughter and sister maddy cusack who live in my constituency in horsley and pass away tragically in september i dedicate this bill to she with the knowledge that she would approve of its content give her love for the game and for the safety of the fan who come to watch her light up the pitch week in week out the maddy cusack foundation have be set up in her honour with the aim of continue her legacy the foundation have do wonderful work provide opportunity and inspire young girl and woman in football include sponsor local team to ensure that the next generation of footballer be equip to face the world in the fierce determined and spirited manner that maddy face it i encourage member in their own time to look into the wonderful work that the foundation be do 
 i thank the football association and the football association of wales which have both support this bill the clerks and civil servant who help to draft it and offer support throughout the process the member who take it through committee and my hon friend the members for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales and for hartlepool mr brash who co sponsor the bill i thank baroness casey for her report and the important work she have do around fan safety and i thank my staff who provide continued guidance and support i must also extend my thank to lord brennan whose work as the original promoter of the bill have be invaluable 
 football be a game of half at the risk of create an overstretched analogy i believe it be fitting that the half of this bill and its journey should be play out under lord brennan ’s capable guidance and captaincy in the other place should it pass today if the bill pass i will happily pass the armband to he 
 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read the time and pass 
 consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee 
 i beg to move amendment page line leave out and 
 with this it will be convenient to discuss the follow 
 amendment page line at end insert 
 and 
 c set out a timetable for implement any change in the law recommend by the review 
 amendment page line leave out in particular 
 amendment page line leave out and insert 
 amendment page line leave out in the opinion of the secretary of state 
 amendment in clause page line leave out from be to end of line and insert arrangement in place to 
 amendment page line after appoint insert 
 within the period of month begin with the day on which this act be pass 
 amendment in clause page line leave out 
 in the opinion of nhs england 
 amendment page line leave out subsection 
 this be certainly not a trivial bill it be a really important piece of legislation which i congratulate   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   on introduce and pioneer it be not a government handout it be an idea that he think need to be the subject of legislation and he have pursue it we have a fantastic reading debate there be tremendous interest in the bill may i therefore make it clear at the outset that my amendment be design to try to strengthen the bill rather than anything else 
 i explain my position to the hon gentleman yesterday he say understandably that to a large extent he be constrain because he be try to negotiate with the government and with the department of health and social care and unless he show himself to be reasonably compliant he would not have get the bill to a state where it could be accept by the government 
 i note the different position on this and i fully understand and respect the hon gentleman ’s position   the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   basically say that if she have introduce such a bill she would have get so steamed up about it that she would have include a lot more strength and safeguard and as a consequence it probably would not have get anywhere near be consider on report those be different approach i be relatively speak neutral on the matter i be a sympathetic supporter of the bill but i have a lot of background   experience of how government always try to give themselves wriggle room in effect to maintain control over everything and in my view the bill could be improve by be amend with the will of the house on report 
 we could talk about take some of my amendment to the other place but the trouble be that the government machine may say that there will not be any more sit friday in this house so if the bill be to be amend in the other place it might fall completely because it would need to be bring back here that be why it be important that the house should consider these amendment now rather than leave they to the other place 
 amendment which be to be read with amendment be a prime example of the point i make early we have a commitment from the government that 
 the secretary of state must carry out a review of the law relate to marketing authorisation for orphan medicinal product that be for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer 
 great 
 and prepare and publish a report set out the conclusion of the review 
 but what be the timescale for that and what will happen after those conclusion be produce there be no obligation on the government to do anything else the review and its conclusion could be just leave on side we in the house be in a position to tighten those provision up and say this be not good enough there should be a timetable for implement the change in the law recommend by the review that be the essence of the amendment 
 to look at another gap that could be exploit by the government the bill say that the report must be 
 publish before the end of the period of year begin with the day on which the act be pass 
 i have table amendment to say that the period should be year 
 in respect of both those point i have have a helpful email from diana jupp from pancreatic cancer uk who write on behalf of more than charity represent patient affect by rare and less common cancer she comment on my amendment on amendment she say 
 we be keen to push for this change with the department once we reach implementation stage of the bill 
 with the great of respect to diana jupp we can do this now instead of leave it to she and her colleague to try to pressurise the department later we in this house have the power to change the legislation in the way that i have suggest so that there would be a timetable set out for implement the change in the law recommend by the review 
 in response to amendment diana jupp say that 
 this timeline have be agree with the department and in our opinion would tie into the timeline of other develop cancer policy implementation include the cancer plan 
 obviously the most important part of her comment be that the timeline have be agree with the department because if it have not be the department and the minister would not have take the bill forward in this way and agree to it 
 on the timeline i draw the house ’s attention to the evidence base set out in the impact assessment it say that the whole process will take year the department   reckon that it will cost £ and set out how many full time equivalent civil servant will be involve in it if it will only take year why be we say that it need to have year that be an example of why we need to tighten up the bill because if this be a review that need to and will be carry out why do we not get on with it to suggest that it will take long than a year be to go against the department ’s own evidence set out in the impact assessment 
 the impact assessment say on page under the heading mandate a government review of the orphan drug regulation 
 this will place a duty on the government to publish a review which will be a comparison of orphan drug regulations specifically part of the human medicines regulations and international regulatory approach to support the research and development of orphan medicinal product that be for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer since the review be concern with orphan drug regulation it be by default cover rare cancer the finding should be publish within year on page paragraph on financial cost say 
 it be difficult to estimate the resource cost require for the orphan drug review since the exact scope remain to be agree however we estimate the cost to the department of health and social care to produce and publish a report on orphan drug regulations to incur cost of approximately £ m in relation to staff resource this reflect the cost of x scs staff x fte grade or grade staff x grade staff and x seo staff for year 
 that be what the government say only year will be necessary 
 in that case why be my generous amendment which would restrict the period from year to year unacceptable to the government there be a history of dragging of foot at the department of health and social care i be afraid we certainly hear about that on reading i give the house that specific example of why on the government ’s own evidence they should accept the change from year to 
 amendment would leave out in particular from line which read 
 in carry out the review the secretary of state must in particular consider regulatory approach in other country 
 the amendment be intend to probe rather than anything else why do the word in particular need to be incorporate surely it would be simple to say that the secretary of state must consider regulatory approach in other countries”—full stop period but that be not how it be at the moment 
 amendment would leave out the reference to the secretary of state this be to do with the definition of a rare cancer currently clause would add this wording to the national health service act 
 the research that the secretary must facilitate or otherwise promote under subsection 1)(a include research into cancer that in the opinion of the secretary of state be rare cancer 
 why can not it not just say that be rare cancer indeed clause would also add this wording to the act 
 in this section rare cancer mean a cancer that affect not more than in people in the united kingdom 
 that be an issue of fact the secretary of state should not be able to basically have a veto over the interpretation of what be or be not a rare cancer 
 this be just another example of the control freakery within the department i be sorry that so far the minister do not seem to have stand up to official who have persuade he no doubt that we need the expression 
 in the opinion of the secretary of state 
 again the argument be quite straightforward and the people from pancreatic cancer uk be on my side but they be obviously very keen for the bill to get on to the statute book we all have to recognise that it be within the government ’s power to prevent it from make any further progress that be why it will be quite difficult i suppose to persuade the minister to accept amendment 
 amendment would leave out from be to the end of the line and insert arrangement in place to in this statement in clause 
 in discharge the duty under subsection 1)(a in relation to those cancer the secretary of state must in particular ensure that there be such arrangement in place as the secretary of state consider appropriate to 
 why can we not just say arrangement in place to enable potential participant in clinical trial and so on why do we need to give the secretary of state discretion a veto essentially over whether he consider those arrangement to be appropriate it seem to i completely redundant unnecessary and indeed oppressive it be counter to the express wish of this house on reading when there be impatience over the delay because of the need to get on with this and suspicion over the failure of the department of health and social care under not just this government but previous government which i would be the to accept to actually deal with the crisis involve people who be subject to rare cancer that be amendment i be try to beetle through these amendment quite quickly madam deputy speaker so that other people can participate in this important debate 
 amendment attempt to tie down when clinical trial will be able to be implement it relate to the research and the requirement on the secretary of state to ensure the appointment of a person to be know as the national speciality lead for rare cancer but there be no timescale for that to be do so i be propose month there be a wide issue though there be no reason why the appointment could not be make now there be no reason why it could not have be make when the bill be introduce it be quite clear from the impact assessment that the speciality lead will be appoint by a quango essentially which already have specialty lead for a whole lot of other issue why can we not just appoint this person now it be say that the cost of the appointment will be a mere £ 
 i do not understand why it be necessary to include in the bill a specific requirement that the appointment be make when we know that the national institute for health and care research have national speciality lead for research delivery within the research delivery network their role be 
 primarily to support research delivery in their discipline within health and care setting with knowledge and experience of the full scope of the nihr and the wide health and care delivery infrastructure in england 
 the lead work with patient the public health and care professional include research and development community within the nhs and wide care system academic and life science partner they 
 aim to ensure strategic oversight and a focus on continuous improvement of the research delivery portfolio 
 such specialty lead therefore already exist they do not exist courtesy of specific legislation require that they exist they already exist under the nihr why have the nihr not appoint such a specialty lead to deal with rare cancer why be it necessary for we to legislate to require that but in weak legislation that do not set out any timetable for the making of that appointment that in my view be another reason for tighten up the bill 
 the impact assessment under the policy objective state 
 this aim to ensure there be adequate oversight of research delivery for rare cancer by appoint a name person in england to provide leadership and advice for the delivery of rare cancer research it be envisage this individual would be employ by the nihr 
 it be accept that that person would be employ by the nihr so why do we have to wait for that person to be employ and it be say that the cost will be only some £ a year with my amendment i be try to emphasise the need for proportionality 
 amendment would leave out 
 in the opinion of nhs england 
 from clause as we know nhs england be not short of opinion but that be by the bye clause 3(3 state 
 after subsection insert 
 5a in subsection 5)(da relevant clinical trial mean clinical trial in connection with the research and development of orphan medicinal product for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer that in the opinion of nhs england be rare cancer 
 now i have already refer to this the bill define rare cancer as 
 a cancer that affect not more than in people in the united kingdom 
 so what be it to do with nhs england the definition of a rare cancer be already in the bill surely it be a matter of fact it should not be the subject of qualification or guessing by nhs england so why be it in the bill in my submission it give the department more wriggle room perhaps it mean that a whole lot of people in nhs england will have to work out whether a particular cancer complie with the definition of a rare cancer that 
 affect not more than in people 
 there be another problem here the bill refer to the opinion of nhs england as i understand it nhs england be to my great delight about to be demolish or rather abolish perhaps both demolish and abolish so why be we seek to include in primary legislation a reference to what in the government ’s view be already a redundant body i would have expect the government to have come forward with an amendment on that but i be at their service as always and if they accept amendment then they will leave out 
 in the opinion of nhs england 
 and remove nhs england and any reference to that organisation from the bill i hope i be tempt the minister to accept some of my amendment and tempt other member to speak in support of they 
 finally amendment again relate to clause and the 
 disclosure of information for research purpose 
 currently subsection state 
 after subsection 
 of the health and social care act 
 insert—(6a a power confer by this section to process information do not authorise the processing of information which would contravene the data protection legislation 
 that be fine we can understand that but i would be grateful if the minister expand when respond to the debate on what be then in bracket 
 but the power be to be take into account in determine whether the processing would contravene that legislation 
 if somebody could explain what that mean that would be extremely helpful we know from the note that the common law duty of maintain privacy still apply they be not remove as a result of this provision so what do those word mean this be very much a probe amendment to try to obtain more information 
 madam deputy speaker that be a succinct summary of the point i be make and why i table those amendment or people out of ignorance frankly have write to i suggest that i have something other than their good interest at heart i do have their good interest at heart which i why i be put forward these amendment i hope i will get a positive response from the government 
 i rise to oppose the amendment but i thank   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for table they for engage with the bill and for our conversation yesterday which i really appreciate i understand the state intent of the proposal although i be not minded to support they 
 over the last month i have hold dozen of meeting with family survivor sufferer charity clinician and legal expert all with the aim of deliver meaningful change in this field those meeting be not so that i could tell people about the bill but so that those people could shape the bill i fear that if we be to pass these amendment they would upset the delicate balance of hope and aspiration that underpin the bill it be not just about the minister as the hon member suggest there be a whole coalition of people who have different opinion about the bill and i do not think any person have a right to change it in that way include i that would be hugely disrespectful and a disappointment to that coalition but i understand the hon member ’s point 
 the minister will go through the amendment in turn so i will focus on key one the review of orphan drug be of the hard fight thing in the negotiation with the department and charity but we find a point that we could all agree on i appreciate that the hon member want it to go far and perhaps we could speculate about the outcome and well prepare for it but it be much await by the charity and they be grateful for it i do not want to speak on their behalf but that be what i have hear from they that cover amendment and 
 amendment be about the definition of a rare cancer which be an aspect of the bill that i have not speak about in any great detail so it be worth touch on here the bill set the definition of a rare cancer in   statute and align it with the definition of a rare disease which be a useful simplification in future let we hope that some condition fall out of that rare specification and need less emphasis and let we also hope that people in the department look at the treatment that be be develop inside and outside the uk it be right that there should be a bit of flexibility at the edge of what the department consider a rare cancer 
 the timeline of the review be year again we spend a great deal of time talk about that for some while it be go to be much long than year and all of we want it to be much short but that be the compromise we reach it be like goldilocks and the bears we reach that compromise together so i urge the hon member to respect our negotiation on that issue 
 i hear what the hon member be say but why do the impact assessment say that the cost be for staff for only year if the review will take year why be the staff fund for only 
 i thank the hon member for that question of course the review will not start on day after pass the bill it will take time to get up and run the exist workload of those staff member will have to be reallocate and i hope and expect there to be some initial engagement with the sector both charity and pharmaceutical company so a bit of flexibility be require to be honest i would love more money to be spend on that review so that we can get more depth and it can have a great impact i be sure other hon member present would agree 
 i hope the hon member for christchurch understand my position and recognise the strength of cross party and sector wide support that have bring the bill this far i regret not invite he to take part in the bill committee we would have benefit from some of these comment at that stage but some of the point that have be raise be discuss in committee it be a reasonably long discussion it do not last for hour but it be not as short as some i remain committed to work constructively with colleague as the bill progress beyond today let we hope it get beyond today but i respectfully ask in the strong possible term that these amendment be not press if they be i hope members will oppose they 
 to your delight i be sure madam deputy speaker and to the delight of the whole house especially that of the government whips i be not go to speak for very long on report although i be not promise not to speak for some time on reading i wish to briefly speak to amendment and table by my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope before that though i congratulate   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   on the bill i be generally supportive of it and think it be entirely necessary 
 turn to the amendment my hon friend the member for christchurch be right it do concern i that the word 
 the opinion of the secretary of state 
 be include propose new subsection of section 1e of the national health service act as my hon friend have point out propose new subsection of section 1e and propose new subsection 5a of section of the health and social care act set out the definition of a rare cancer and if the bill pass that definition will become law i therefore think there be a contradiction within this piece of legislation it contain an absolute definition of a rare cancer but add some ambiguity by refer to the opinion of the secretary of state i ask the minister to explain how both those thing can be true if the secretary of state decide that there be some other definition of a rare cancer how can that possibly be in line with the definition that be write into the law 
 as the hon member for edinburgh south west have say the definition that have be include in the bill that a rare cancer be 
 a cancer that affect not more than in people in the united kingdom 
 align it with the uk rare disease framework which be publish by lord bethell in the other place in it seem to i that that be an effective and suitable definition so again i ask the minister whether he expect there to be some other definition if he do not expect that why be it necessary to include the word 
 the opinion of the secretary of state 
 the bill be not even consistent propose new subsection of section 1e of the national health service act refer to the opinion of the secretary of state but propose new subsection 5a of section of the health and social care act talk about 
 the opinion of nhs england 
 as my hon friend the member for christchurch have point out nhs england be fortunately go to be abolish very soon when that happen will we have to pass either primary legislation or secondary legislation to delete those word from the bill would it not be well if we delete the word the opinion of nhs england now why will the minister not consider remove they if there be some reason why he think the secretary of state might have to change the definition why be those clause of the bill not consistent 
 i hope hon member will see that what the hon member for christchurch and i be try to achieve certainly through amendment and be to establish a clear definition of a rare cancer we be aim to ensure that there be no ambiguity in that definition and if there be to be ambiguity we want to at least ensure that the body or authority that be go to make any change be consistent in the legislation 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i rise to speak on behalf of his majesty ’s official opposition in support of the rare cancers bill and to welcome its thoughtful and necessary intervention on behalf of a group of patient who have be under research under represent and under acknowledge for too long i commend   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   on bring this bill forward and on his ongoing dedication to the issue 
 the case for the bill be clear rare cancer define in line with the uk rare disease framework as condition affect few than in people be individually uncommon but collectively account for more than of all cancer diagnosis however as we know patient with rare cancer routinely face delay diagnosis limited treatment option and far few opportunity to participate in clinical research 
 the bill do not claim to be a silver bullet but it do mark a significant step forward in how we think about and legislate for research regulation and datum access in rare cancer care it be focus proportionate and strategically align with the exist nhs and national institute for health and care research framework 
 clause place a duty on the secretary of state to carry out a review of the law relate to marketing authorisation for orphan medicinal product that be for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer it also rightly require that the review include comparison with regulatory approach in other country this be vital the explanatory note rightly observe that research into rare cancer be often commercially unattractive because of small patient population and high developmental cost if our regulatory environment create further barrier to entry patient suffer not because the science do not exist but because the system do not support it 
 the uk ’s current approach to orphan designation lack the pre authorisation incentive find in system such as the european medicines agency and the us food and drug administration the review require under the bill be the opportunity to ask whether we be do enough to attract the research and development that rare cancer patient deserve 
 i be not quite sure whether my hon friend be respond to the amendment or make a reading speech i hope he will address the amendment i have table include those that relate to clause about which he have just speak 
 if my hon friend bear with i i will turn directly to his amendment it be important to set out the context because we must understand the clause if we be to debate the amendment to they 
 clause make crucial change to the secretary of state ’s duty under the national health service act by state explicitly that it must include research into cancer that in the opinion of the secretary of state be rare although this matter the research agenda be often drive by number and funding scale by mandate that rare cancer be part of the agenda the bill begin to shift the culture towards inclusion equity and long term thinking 
 i particularly welcome the creation of the national specialty lead for rare cancer model the nihr ’s exist structure of research delivery leader this individual will be task with promote and facilitate research advise on trial design and convening collaboration the success of this role will depend on it not just be symbolically support but have a clear remit adequate funding and a strategic alignment with the wide nihr research delivery network 
 clause amend section of the health and social care act to allow nhs england to disclose information from cancer registry for the purpose of identify and contact potential clinical trial participant this be a significant and necessary step the bill distinguish between a disease registry like the national disease registration service and a contact registry such as be part of research make sure that these system can speak to each other will be of significant benefit when it come to match patient with opportunity importantly the clause reaffirm that any such datum sharing must remain compliant with the data protection act as propose new subsection 6a to the act make clear 
 a power confer by this section to process information do not authorise the processing of information which would contravene the data protection legislation 
 this be a safeguard that we must preserve not weaken if we be to maintain public trust in the system 
 at this point i turn to the amendment table by my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope he approach private member bills in the way that a jeweller examine diamond with a magnifying glass a steady hand and absolutely no tolerance for flaw we may grumble as the clock tick on but deep down we all sleep well know that he be read the footnote this bill be no different he have approach it with rigour and i thank he for his commitment to precision and improve clarity and accountability as he point out the bill be not trivial therefore it be not only right but indeed the duty of this house to scrutinise closely legislation and amendment lay before we 
 to that end several of the amendment aim to tighten the bill ’s drafting or introduce firm deadline for example amendment would reduce the timeframe for the review under clause from year to amendment would require the secretary of state to 
 set out a timetable for implement any change in the law recommend by the review 
 i understand the concern that review can drift but the year period reflect the complexity of the subject a uk wide review of the human medicines regulations include benchmarke against other jurisdiction and engage multiple agency compress the timeline might jeopardise the depth or quality of the analysis likewise a statutory timetable for implementation could constrain the government prematurely before the review ’s conclusion be even know 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for his unprompted comment he will know that the funding be sufficient to staff the review only for year if there be only fund for year why do it take 
 my hon friend know far well than i not to look at legislation in isolation the government will at some point bring forward the cancer plan which will have a direct crossover with the bill so it be right to give the government the freedom and space to implement the legislation if we rush it we could get it wrong which would be even more detrimental for those who suffer with rare cancer 
 other amendment address definition and discretion for example amendment would remove 
 in the opinion of the secretary of state 
 from the definition of rare cancer and amendment would remove similar wording in relation to nhs england ’s discretion at glance the amendment may seem like matter of tidy drafting but retain discretion be important especially as regard rare cancer prevalence datum can be uncertain or lagging and flexibility allow for expert judgment about edge case in which rigid definition may unintentionally exclude patient from trial or research that could benefit they 
 on top of that there be concern even about simple definition we be still explore the difference between for example pre cancerous and cancerous cell if someone go for a smear that be what they be tell this be a new area who know what will come up in the future simply define rare cancer on the basis of lag prevalence datum be a risk and it be therefore right that the government and the secretary at state have discretion to direct in way or another 
 however i would grateful if the government would answer the question which have be rightly pose of who or what will fill the role when nhs england be abolish it be not clear exactly what that will look like i have ask the minister this question several time in relation to the mental health bill and other area and it be a question that this house should rightly ask who will be responsible for what when and why 
 that say amendment which would ensure that the propose national specialty lead be appoint within month of royal assent deserve serious consideration patient have wait long enough if the government be confident that the post can be establish promptly and resource effectively i would welcome that ambition be state at the dispatch box today 
 finally i must express my concern about amendment which propose to remove the data protection safeguard in clause 3(4 although the provision may be declaratory in that it reaffirm exist legal obligation it none the less offer clarity and reassurance in an area as sensitive as health datum such clarity matter and the subsection ’s removal could cause unnecessary concern even if the underlying law remain unchanged 
 in conclusion this bill be not about grandstand it be modest in financial cost careful in its drafting and realistic in its scope but its impact could be significant for patient live with rare cancer and clinician and researcher strive to support they the bill offer real hope hope for fast access to innovation hope for more inclusive research and hope for a regulatory system that work for the many not just the minority every patient matter whether they be in or in as we state on reading and in committee we support the bill and i thank the house for give i the chance to explain why 
 i be grateful to my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for bring this bill before the house and i congratulate he on get it to report amendment allow amendment to be insert into the bill   amendment would require the secretary of state have carry out the review describe in clause to set out a timetable for implement change to the law recommend by the review however it would not be appropriate to presume the outcome of the review of orphan drug regulation that be outline in clause amendment presuppose that the review will recommend change the law and that there be change the secretary of state would be willing to support follow a legal consultation that be not consider appropriate at this stage 
 amendment be unnecessarily restrictive introduce wording that confine the review unnecessarily we want to ensure that a thorough review be conduct and my hon friend the minister for secondary care will be work with her official to ensure that that happen for amendment the year timeframe to prepare and publish the review and the necessary resourcing requirement have be discuss with official in my department and at the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency i remind member that the text in the bill reflect the statutory deadline but we will endeavour to publish a report ahead of the year timeframe which have be put forward to be consistent with the mhra ’s overall workplan 
 on amendment there be different definition of a rare cancer and we work with my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west to agree the definition in the bill as a cancer that affect not more than in people in the uk however a level of discretion for the secretary of state be require over what fall within that definition since the fact underlie and the datum on diagnosis be constantly change the amendment would make it difficult to implement the clause in practical and operational term 
 amendment would remove the ability of the secretary of state to exercise discretion as to how their duty would be discharge this be not consider appropriate since it make the operation of clause less workable in practice and would lack the government ’s assessment of what in all the circumstance would be the most appropriate manner of implementation amendment would introduce a specific timeframe just month to allow the appointment of the specialty lead although i agree that we will need to appoint the specialty lead promptly introduce a statutory timeframe be not consider workable for practical reason there could be unforeseen delay for example recruitment process might delay the appointment beyond month 
 on amendment as mention previously there be different definition for a rare cancer that be because the datum on cancer diagnosis be constantly change and decision on whether the criterion for a rare cancer be meet will inevitably involve an element of judgment the amendment would make it difficult to implement the clause in practical and operational term
