i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to review the criminal injuries compensation authority and for connected purpose 
 from time to time this house have ask itself the question what value do we place on support for the victim of violent crime i believe that this be the right time to ask ourselves that question again 
 victim support can take many form include non financial measure we have get well but we must get well still at recognise the lifelong impact that violent crime have on a person victim would benefit from well sharing of information about support service both public and voluntary and the process for access nhs diagnostic and therapeutic support that information sharing should start with the police the ambulance service and the crown prosecution service and i be pleased to hear recently from the cps west midland region about the enhanced victim support that be now in place nevertheless there will always be case in which financial loss have occur or financial remedy be a necessary or otherwise appropriate mean of provide some measure of justice for those who have suffer assault 
 i think that member in all part of the house would wholeheartedly endorse the principle that whenever possible the perpetrator of violent crime should pay the cost of restitution indeed it be a welcome and remarkable achievement that the amount recover to fund support service through the victim surcharge introduce in have nearly double over the last year however the criminal injury compensation scheme exist because some offender lack or can not be prove to possess the asset or revenue to pay those cost the so call straw man of the justice system and in still more case the perpetrator of violence be never identify crime statistic notoriously do not tell the full story but in the west midlands police force area nearly in violent assault be not prosecute because no suspect can be name i commend the chief constable craig guildford and the police and crime commissioner simon foster for their success in increase the number and the share of identified assailant but the point stand 
 the animate force behind the current criminal injury compensation scheme be a birmingham magistrate and the secretary of the howard league for penal reform margery fry who lead a campaign in the 1950 under the clarion call of justice for victim she argue that criminal injury could not be narrowly consider to be a private matter between the assailant and the victim just as we provide for each other in time of sickness through national insurance so too she argue a duty be owe by the state when it fail to prevent citizen from injure another in her word 
 the state can not disown all responsibility for its occasional failure to protect 
 today that same principle be set out by the criminal injuries compensation authority which say that payment be sometimes need as an 
 acknowledgement of harm and an important gesture of public sympathy 
 the criminal injury compensation scheme be now an integral part of the justice system even if it be as the chair of the justice committee my hon friend   the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter put it last week something of a cinderella service 
 nothing that i say today be intend as a criticism of the staff of the criminal injuries compensation authority they work hard in difficult circumstance give that staff number have fall by a since the current iteration of the scheme be introduce in the civil service people survey show that they take pride and find professional fulfilment in their work and as someone who once receive an award from the scheme i remain grateful to they 
 important and positive improvement have be make since year ago the victim commissioner publish an excoriating report let i say at this point how welcome it be to see the under secretary of state for justice   the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones in her place i know that she care deeply about victim support as well as have specialist knowledge of this issue and i be grateful to she for her thoughtful response and conversation about it however it be also clear that failing remain within the system as we hear last week when member across party contribute to a debate in westminster hall 
 i draw particular attention today to the delay that too many applicant still experience a lack of signposting or integration with wide support service and a general lack of public awareness of the scheme itself the trauma of dog attack on postal worker and other victim by new and ban breed the victim of which be mostly ineligible for compensation follow change to the scheme in the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse a supposedly £ a year hardship fund establish year ago that be now essentially a dead letter the criterion be so restrictive that no payment have be make from it in the last year and the tariff system itself as many serious and life change injury be not cover at all it be true that the upper cap on the scheme be generous by international standard but the low limit of £ have be freeze in cash term since 
 my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson   refer in this place to annex b of the scheme which define a crime of violence as include 
 a sexual assault to which a person do not in fact consent 
 those be word and idea from another age even if the court now adopt a more informed interpretation the continued presence of that definition can only cause harm and it must be strike from the scheme 
 these problem and i believe on the basis of my own casework and that of other member that they do to an extent persist impose a heavy burden on the victim of crime like some other member i bear the physical scar of violent crime alongside other scar of a different and more subtle kind i have speak previously in another debate about that experience and i do not intend to repeat those word today it be enough to ask hon member to take it on trust that delay the seemingly   arbitrary rule of the scheme the manner of the communication and sometimes poor decision making can add to the sum of the pain that victim feel a pain that can only be partially outweigh by the release that the end of the criminal injury process bring a perpetrator might evade justice but it be part of the nature of the trauma response that at a slight or unexpected prompting a victim may be compel to relive that crime again and again 
 that be why the victim commissioner have call for an overarching review of the scheme to establish 
 whether it actually fulfil its stated remit to acknowledge the harm suffer by victim of violent crime who have no other access to compensation and to provide redress as part of a just and compassionate response 
 that be what the bill which i beg leave to introduce would achieve the legislation would set out a simple requirement for a fundamental review and for ministers to report back to the house with proposal for further scrutiny and debate 
 i can not stand here and claim that easy answer exist to all these question although i note that to the good of my calculation the cost of the scheme appear to be fall in real term we live in straiten financial time that be why it be well for reform of the scheme to be carry out in a deliberative manner on the basis of accurate and recent evidence and with the need of victim as the primary concern to that end i take heart from the minister ’s statement that the government do not plan change to the scheme at this time she go on to say 
 the clear message to i be that we need change and i will be consider how government can well provide the support that victim need and deserve 
 i also take heart from the prime minister ’s statement of personal support for the victim of violent crime when this matter be raise with he a fortnight ago by my hon friend   the member for warrington north charlotte nichols 
 this issue touch the life of people in every of our constituency no amount of money can return someone to their mental or physical state prior to an assault but a well function fair and compassionate scheme can bring victim some measure of justice

 sarah joanne pochin for runcorn and helsby 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of implement a national maternity improvement strategy 
 we expect all woman to be show the utmost care and respect when receive maternity and neonatal care this year ’s planning guidance require integrate care board and provider to deliver the key action in this final year of nhs england ’s year delivery plan it be clear from listen to the harrowing story of bereaved and harm family however that we must do more the secretary of state be urgently consider the significant action need to ensure that all woman and baby receive the care they deserve 
 last year ’s birth trauma inquiry report expose that maternity service in this country be woefully underfunded and now the health secretary intend to cut the budget for maternity improvement from £ to just £ equate to less than £ per child bear in this country each year what kind of change be that what message will that send to mother across the country do the secretary of state plan to implement any of the recommendation from the birth trauma inquiry report many of which be commit to by the previous government 
 the hon gentleman be not correct maternity funding be not ringfence at the same level i think that be what he be refer to it have however absolutely be commit to as far as icb allocation be concern local leader will decide how good to allocate that money we will continue to work with donna ockenden and the family who have be affect   by previous incident and ensure that the recommendation of her report and the maternity review be fully implement 
 as colleague will be aware there be a consistent failure in maternity unit to listen to woman and put their experience and quite often their pain during childbirth at the heart of drive improvement what assurance can the minister give we that woman ’s experience and voice will be at the heart of any maternity improvement strategy that the government focus on 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that point which have be find in all the review that have be undertake it be completely unacceptable that be why the secretary of state have continue to meet family and hear their experience to ensure that we learn from they continue to support the implementation of those recommendation and crucially ensure that woman ’s voice be take forward as part of our year plan 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i fear that many will have find the minister ’s answer to my hon friend   the member for windsor jack rankin   disappointing he highlight that the previous government commit to the headline recommendation of the cross party birth trauma inquiry lead by   the hon member for canterbury rosie duffield   and the former member for stafford theo clarke who have recently write about her experience in a book and in the daily mail call for a national maternity improvement strategy no equivalent commitment have be make by this government let we try again will the minister commit without any equivocation to implement the inquiry ’s recommendation to produce a national maternity improvement strategy 
 to be clear for the shadow secretary of state the secretary of state be continue to look at all those recommendation and consider how good to respond 
 we now come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 too many family in shropshire have suffer the agonising loss of a baby follow the scandal at shrewsbury and telford hospital nhs trust the care quality commission rat of trust as inadequate or require improvement for maternity safety and the taxpayer fork out a staggering £ in compensation for maternity failing last year with the £ put aside to deal with unsafe staffing no long ringfence can the minister reassure we that those safe staffing level will remain on our maternity ward 
 i know the liberal democrat spokesperson follow this issue very closely in her own local community as she know we be commit to ensure that the recommendation of the review be fully implement as part of that year plan but i gently say to she that the liberal democrat party have consistently oppose the extra £ that this government raise to   support the wide health service without that extra funding and the decision that the chancellor have make we would not be able to make the progress that we be now start to see 
 what step he be take to shift care from hospital into the community 
 what step he be take to shift care from hospital into the community 
 despite my good effort may i welcome   the hon member for runcorn and helsby sarah pochin   to her place be a member of parliament be a privilege and i know how special it be to sit on these benches have be send here by constituent regardless of our political difference i wish she well personally 
 as part of our year plan for health we want to deliver a real shift in the centre of gravity in the nhs so that people get more care close to home and indeed in their home too the nhs be as much a neighbourhood health service as a national health service we have already make progress in shift care to the community provide more than £ in funding for gps agree the gp contract for the time since the pandemic and recruit more than gps on to the frontline our year plan will set out how we will continue to transform the nhs into a neighbourhood health service 
 i be deeply concerned about the quality of healthcare for people experience homelessness in my constituency of bournemouth west healthbus a local charity be do great work in get out into the community to treat people where they be and to prevent they from have to go into hospital but it be not get the funding that it need and have discover serious discrepancy in the way that the local integrate care board commission service particularly in relation to health inequality can the secretary of state tell i how this government be prioritise health outcome for people experience homelessness and will he meet i and healthbus to discuss how we can support its important work 
 the found mission of the nhs be to be there for people whenever they fall ill so that they never have to worry about the bill unfortunately thank to the disaster and the failure of year of conservative government too many people in our country today experience the fear that nye bevan seek to eradicate as my hon friend would expect tackle health inequality for homeless people and other vulnerable group be central to the value of this labour government those value will be reflect in our year plan for health i would be delighted to hear from she far on what we can do to improve service in her area 
 i thank the secretary of state for his announcement this morning regard gp service way that pressure be ease in our gp service be through charity such as compassion in action which provide   non clinical whole person care in my constituency it receive gp referral from across leigh and align with the government ’s aim to shift care from hospital to community will the minister join i in thank the staff and the founder pam gilligan and agree to come for a tour of the facility and to see at hand the impact that they have 
 i wholeheartedly join my hon friend in thank pam and everyone at compassion in action for the work that they do at the heart of our approach to health be a recognition that government action be essential for improve health outcome in the country and that government act alone will not be sufficient that be why work with the voluntary sector employer trade union community group and all of we as individual citizen be vital for tackle health inequality and improve care in our country i would be delighted to ensure that of the team pay a visit to the charity as soon as possible 
 stuart anderson welcome back 
 community hospital can reduce pressure on major hospital especially in rural community such as mine will the secretary of state lie out his plan to support community hospital in south shropshire 
 at the heart of this government ’s approach be investment in and reform of the nhs to ensure that we deliver well outcome for patient that mean the big devolution of power in the history of the nhs with more decision take close to patient and to their community and more power in the hand of patient too community hospital have a vital role to play and thank to this government ’s decision to deliver £ more into our nhs oppose by the conservative party we will no doubt be able to make further and fast progress 
 in my constituency there be an age population in need of local healthcare service will the secretary of state meet his scottish counterpart to discuss the need for increase access to community healthcare and specifically the need for a new health and care centre within my constituency 
 the hon member will be delighted to know that only last week i meet with my counterpart in scotland wales and northern ireland to talk about how we can work together to improve health and care throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland she will know that health be devolve but thank to the decision take by this labour government the scottish government have just be deliver the big financial settlement since devolution begin that might mean that they finally make some progress on their waiting list in scotland where in scot be on a waiting list and the snp be on its nhs reform plan in year 
 what step his department be take to support gps to spend more time with patient 
 i be pleased to tell my hon friend that we have recruit over additional gps since october through an investment of £ help to fix the front door to the nhs today we have announce £ to unlock new capacity and more appointment in gp surgery we have also launch a red tape challenge and scrap unnecessary target in our new gp contract to cut down on bureaucracy and free up time to spend with patient 
 my constituent in halesowen have write to i time and again complain that they be call their gp surgery at am as instruct but be still unable to get a same day appointment can the minister set out how the £ investment in gp surgery consult room and other facility will finally put an end to the frustrating am scramble 
 i absolutely share the frustration of my hon friend and his constituent the investment make today be in response to gps tell we that they need more space the investment will lead to more capacity and well access and outcome for his constituent today ’s announcement be only possible thank to the decision make in the october budget which be oppose by every party opposite the choice be clear investment in our nhs with labour or cut with the tories and reform 
 my constituent dr toby nelson an nhs consultant dermatologist have start a business that seek to address the heavy demand on primary care for skin health screening his business map my mole send an image capture kit to patient to attach to their smartphone the patient then send a high resolution image remotely to be review by a specialist consultant bypass the need for a gp appointment and free up time and resource for both doctor and patient it have already result in a significant drop in skin cancer referral in pilot gp surgery will the minister agree to meet dr nelson and i to discuss this revolutionary proposal 
 the hon lady raise what sound like an extremely interesting scheme she will know that we have a strong commitment in our year plan to shift from hospital to community and indeed from analogue to digital the digital aspect of that scheme sound very interesting so i would be more than happy to take further representation from she 
 what step he be take to improve eye healthcare through the year health plan 
 my hon friend be an outstanding campaigner on this issue as i be sure everybody across the house be aware she will know that the nhs england accelerator pilot have show how improved it connectivity and a single point of access can speed up eye care referral and allow more patient to be manage in the community that be a great example of the shift we want to make from analogue to digital we be develop the year   health plan with input from the public our partner and health staff and that of course include the eye care sector 
 i thank the minister for his response and i welcome all the work that he and the secretary of state be do in rebuild our nhs however we know that there be a capacity crisis within eye healthcare nhs ophthalmology continue to be the busy and large outpatient service that be essentially what be lead to many people not get see soon enough which be result in many of they lose their sight unnecessarily what we need be a join up healthcare plan will the minister ensure that eye healthcare will be part of the government ’s wide year health plan 
 my hon friend be right that early intervention be crucial and the interface between the high street and secondary care be a vital part of that that mean have a join up eye health strategy the year plan will have that join up strategy at its heart she will be pleased to know that since july ophthalmology waiting list have drop by so change have begin there be still a long way to go to dig we out of the mess leave by the conservative party but it be thank to the decision that the government have make oppose by opposition party that we be begin to see that change gain traction 
 another part of the year health plan be the use of digital technology auto contouring with artificial intelligence reduce waiting time and free up capacity for radiotherapist which be why £ be allocate to it under the conservative government money that have be cut under the minister ’s government why 
 i think that the right hon gentleman be refer to the single point of access digital technology which be game change in term of improve the interface between high street and secondary care it be probably worth remind he that the question be about eye care we be absolutely committed to single point of access technology which we believe can be game change technology and be a vital part of our shift from analogue to digital 
 the president of the royal college of ophthalmologists have state that the widespread outsourcing of nhs cataract surgery to private for profit provider risk the integrity of hospital eye surgery department mean that there will be few service to treat patient with preventable blindness how can we reassure the public that such service will be maintain 
 although the independent sector clearly have an important role to play in tackle waiting list and backlog we will not tolerate any overpriced or sub par care and we will not tolerate any distortion of patient choice the recently publish partnership agreement between nhs england and the independent healthcare provider network commit to end incentive that can lead to that and to support equal access and genuine choice for all patient we be work together to deliver on that 
 nhs sussex icb be of only in england not to commission a minor eye condition service know as mecs in community optometry setting that mean that patient in chichester with urgent or minor eye issue have to either join the am queue for a gp appointment or go to their hospital rather than be see quickly on the high street give that of mecs patient elsewhere in england be see within hour will the minister set out what action he be take to ensure that those service be commission consistently across all icb within the year health plan 
 icb be responsible for the commissioning of these service which be clearly extremely important and the early intervention side of eye care be particularly important i would be more than happy to look into that issue with the hon lady ’s icb if she write to i and make further representation 
 whether he have have discussion with the secretary of state for housing communities and local government on the interaction between mayor and integrate care board in the context of the english devolution white paper 
 our mission drive approach to this issue mean that we be work with all departments to deliver an nhs fit for the future we expect integrate care board to work closely with their mayor to maximise public health and contribute to the government ’s health and growth mission 
 funding and delivery of a gp surgery for wixams in my constituency continue to fall between the crack of developer local council and the local icb do the minister agree that to break those deadlock and build the infrastructure that our community require new mayor should have the power to direct icb make locally elect politician responsible rather than unelected quango 
 the hon member tempt i slightly on local accountability on which he have be a strong campaigner as he know from meet i i agree that it be important that such local body respond properly so that where there be expansion of housing which we want to see they be support by local infrastructure i be happy to come back to he with any further detail 
 norfolk and waveney integrate care board be consult once again on close norwich ’s walk in centre it ask the same question year ago and the city and norfolk say no we want to save our walk in centre do the minister agree on the importance of walk in centre and in the context of devolution how will we ensure that icb heed what resident say 
 my hon friend be right to campaign on behalf of her constituent to make sure that more service be deliver in community we want to see service bring out of hospital and into local community it be up to the icb to decide how those be commission   but we will certainly make sure that as part of our commitment under our year plan we see more of those sort of service work together in neighbourhood 
 what plan he have to reform nhs health and social care service 
 people deserve the very good health and care our plan for change be already bring waiting list down our year plan for health will set out how we improve access and make the shift that i describe early so that the nhs be fit for the future at the same time we be rebuild adult social care now and for the future baroness casey ’s independent commission have launch and it will set out through its work how we will create a national care service all that be make possible thank to the investment decision take by the chancellor in her budget that investment be oppose by the conservative party which show that only labour can be trust to invest in and modernise our nhs 
 last week the centre for young life publish a report on the state of mental health support for child and young people across england it outline that despite an ongoing crisis in mental health among young people 
 there remain a treatment gap 
 between adult and child ’s mental health and that 
 few than 10% of icb have a dedicated strategy 
 for support child ’s mental health will the secretary of state consider strengthen statutory guidance for icb to ensure they assess the local need of child and young people publish treatment gap datum on an ongoing basis and create join up community base mental health support for our young people 
 young people ’s mental health be a priority for this government that be why we set out in our manifesto our commitment to make sure that mental health support be available in every primary and secondary school in the country we have walk in mental health service in every community and we invest in the mental health workforce so that we can cut waiting time i be also work closely with the secretary of state for education to make sure that our education and health service work together so that child get the very good start in life and so that we look after mind body soul aspiration and future 
 the chancellor increase the cost of employ people in social care by raise national insurance contribution for social care employer and then exempt nhs employer from those increase cost when will this government properly support social care and relieve the sector from pressure cause by the chancellor under this government 
 thank to the decision take by this chancellor we be put £ more into health and social care thank to the decision take by this chancellor the spending power of local authority have rise thank to the decision take by this chancellor we have deliver the big expansion of carer ’s allowance since the 1970 thank to the decision take by this   chancellor we have significantly increase the disabled facility grant not just last year but this year that be the investment deliver by a labour government and oppose by the conservatives and reform and it show that only labour can be trust with our nhs 
 you will have another chance in a minute i call the shadow minister 
 this government have be in power for month month ago labour postpone the cross party talk on social care when will they be reschedule 
 as i have announce to the house baroness casey ’s independent commission be up and run she be make contact with party across the house as part of the work of her commission and it be for she to decide the basis on which she engage with party i look forward to work with party at the conclusion of the process 
 i thank the secretary of state for that change make the process no long cross party the government have say that the change will not be implement fully until only this week the health and social care committee release its new report on social care and the huge cost of inaction the report call for new action that could be take now such as the publishing of annual assessment of unmet care need for adult and annual estimate of how much delayed discharge cost the nhs will the secretary of state commit to those today 
 i take the select committee seriously and i will look carefully at its report but the shadow minister have some brass neck he mention this government have be in office for month but the conservatives have more than year in office and we be pick up the piece from the mess they leave behind that be why they be kick out of government and why they be be kick out of opposition look at this lot i think this must be how the islander feel look at the dodo 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of access to emergency dentistry 
 we be already roll out our manifesto commitment of extra urgent dental appointment per year these appointment be available across the country for those experience painful dental issue such as infection abscess or crack or broken tooth we be committed to reform the dental contract and make nhs dentistry fit for the future 
 the dental contract impose in be widely recognise as a key factor drive dentist out of the nhs in my constituency of stratford on avon there be no nhs dentist currently take on new patient and exist nhs patient be be actively pressure to go private or seek care out of county will the minister commit to urgent reform of nhs dentistry and set out a timeline for negotiation so that i can reassure my constituent 
 the hon member be right to say that the dental contract be fundamentally flawed and need reform i meet representative of the british dental association on   april and have a productive discussion with they about dental contract reform official from the department of health and social care be work hard with the bda and other stakeholder to develop a dental contract that work for patient for dental professional and for the public purse i will of course keep she and the house update i know this issue be of huge importance to the country and to every member of this house 
 it be a year today since i be swear into this house and every single week someone have raise with i the issue of get access to an nhs dentist in blackpool nowhere be take on adult and nowhere be look after pregnant woman this have to change so can the minister outline to my constituent when they will be able to get access to an nhs dentist under this labour government 
 there be no perfect payment system we have to look at the issue around unit of dental activity and at option around capitation and sessional payment and come to a conclusion about what work and about how to ensure that everything that we commit to nhs dentistry be spend on nhs dentistry we be in a mad situation in which although demand for nhs dentistry be go through the roof we have an underspend every year on the contract we have to fix that it will take some time to work that out with the british dental association and other key stakeholder what be tragic about this situation be that the conservatives have year to fix the situation and leave it in a terrible mess 
 what step he be take to improve perinatal mental health provision 
 i commend my hon friend for her work on such an important topic i know it be very personal to she specialist perinatal and maternity mental health service be available across england provide vital support to parent before during and after pregnancy include increase access to evidence base psychological therapy we be train thousand more midwife to well support woman throughout pregnancy with mother and baby unit and community service provide postnatal support 
 tomorrow be world maternal mental health day recognise the particular challenge that some mum face from pregnancy to birth and after birth i commend the secretary of state and his team for their rapid work to get the nhs deliver well for patient again as they develop the year plan for the nhs what measure will be take to ensure that all woman face perinatal mental health challenge can access the right psychological support and that there be no postcode lottery 
 i absolutely join my hon friend in recognise the importance of support woman ’s health throughout pregnancy and into parenthood on maternal mental health day we be committed to improve the   support available and it will form an important part of our year plan we be invest £ in family hub and start for life service to support parent from pregnancy to their child ’s early childhood and we will continue to work with she on this 
 i thank   the hon member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith   for her question and the minister for her answer i be delighted to be form the all party parliamentary group for fatherhood will the minister outline the step that she will take to improve perinatal mental health for father 
 i congratulate the hon member on take forward that work the minister responsible will be happy to continue to work with he in any way possible to support that work on this important aspect of parenthood 
 what step he be take to use new technology to help improve preventive healthcare 
 we be already use technology to improve preventive healthcare and to transform the nhs we have invest £ in artificial intelligence to trial breast cancer screen mammogram interpretation we be pilot the nhs health check online to tackle cardiovascular disease and our nhs better health digital product include the award win couch to k app be use by million of people last year to tackle preventable condition more will be include in the year health plan 
 leeds be lead the way in health tech with leeds teaching hospital the city council nhs digital and firm like emis headquarter in rawdon in my constituency drive real innovation how will the secretary of state and his team ensure that leeds be at the heart of the nhs year plan so that we can shift to prevention and spread the benefit to every corner of the uk 
 i commend the work that my hon friend refer to the new healthtech innovation hub a flagship project of the west yorkshire investment zone bring together west yorkshire combine authority organisation like the healthtech leeds partnership academic clinician policymaker and more than health tech firm headquarter in the region they be already drive forward health innovation together as we have say before we must learn about the good of the nhs and take it to the rest of the nhs the year plan will shift we to a model in which the nhs focus on prevention with more service deliver in local community through new technology 
 a piece of technology that already exist that can prevent hydrocephalus be the humble tape measure the secretary of state say that he would ask the national institute for health and care excellence to conduct a review of the frequency with which infant head should be measure   to allow we to detect hydrocephalus early the charity harry ’s hat hydrocephalus awareness trust base in my constituency say that this review be not necessary and that the evidence be already there will the minister meet i and the charity to discuss this far so that more infant life can be save 
 in fairness the secretary of state do meet they 
 and he have just sell i on what a wonderful charity it be i would be more than happy to make sure that the relevant minister meet the hon member to discuss the matter 
 what progress he have make on the abolition of nhs england 
 as the prime minister and i announce nhs england will be bring back into the department to put an end to the duplication waste and inefficiency result from organisation do the same job that be the final nail in the coffin of the disastrous reorganisation which lead to the long waiting time low patient satisfaction and most expensive nhs reorganisation in history since the announcement we have set up a joint board assess resource and responsibility across exist organisation develop proposal about the role function and structure of the new centre and start detailed operational and legislative planning 
 the secretary of state claim to support change yet delay to nhs reorganisation include to the promise abolition of nhs england suggest otherwise be it not the truth as he outline in his guardian article that he be bogge the system down in a slow top heavy restructuring while resort to tax rise instead of deliver the decentralise locally deliver value for money healthcare that our constituent deserve 
 a lot of word and not a lot of sense we be reform the nhs and as a result of these change redirect hundred of million of pound to the frontline what be the conservative party ’s response to the abolition the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart say it could be a great thing but it 
 could be a total disaster 
 will they let we know when they have make their mind up 
 the lansley reform be implement top down by the conservatives the idea that the nhs could ever be truly independent when it be there to serve we the taxpayer and the general public do the secretary of state agree that it be absolutely the right decision to move funding away from the centre to the frontline to prioritise patient in the nhs ’s work 
 my hon friend have huge experience in this area and she be absolutely right what we see under the conservatives be bloated bureaucracy layer upon layer of checker when we need more doer that be why frontline staff patient and provider leader all welcome the change that we be make so that we can invest more into our frontline 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the health service journal report that official have acknowledge that the draft of a high level plan for merge nhs england and dhsc have be delay when we ask any write question about the merger the standard answer seem to be 
 minister and senior department official will work with the new transformation team at the top of nhs england lead by sir jim mackey to determine the structure and requirement need to support the creation of a new centre for health and care 
 even when we ask a question specifically about the size of the transformation team the answer be virtually identical the government either wilfully decide not to answer or simply do not know as with so many thing the government go for the headline grab announcement and talk the talk on reform without have do the actual work to deliver it my question to the secretary of state be simple when will that high level plan for the merger with a full assessment of cost and saving be publish 
 honestly the right hon member have his chance he be the minister who take forward the last reform act under the conservative government he fail in that task and now he turn up without a shred of remorse or a shred of humility attack this government for clean up the mess that the conservatives leave behind they be not a party of government they be not even a party of opposition any more they be a total irrelevance 
 what step his department be take to implement neighbourhood health centre 
 we be committed to fix the front door of the nhs include by deliver the primary care infrastructure require to enable a neighbourhood health service we have already take step to improve primary care infrastructure include by provide £ of capital funding to upgrade gp building we will set out how we will move to a neighbourhood health service in our upcoming year plan follow the spending review 
 i thank the minister for her answer workington suffer from some really poor health outcome and have an incredibly fragmented health system i have work with local leader in my constituency to pull together a plan for a new neighbourhood health centre call the workington health zone base around multidisciplinary team clear goal less bureaucracy and much great access for patient do the minister agree that this be exactly the kind of reform that we need to enable through the forthcoming year plan 
 i do agree and i would be delighted to work with my hon friend on the government ’s commitment to deliver a neighbourhood health service that reinforce integrate work for the nhs local government social care and wide partner as the norm 
 knutsford desperately need a modern medical centre the local gps and the community be unite in feel that current provision be no long fit for purpose with the population grow it can not meet everybody ’s need in the light of the government ’s announcement of £ to modernise gp surgery so that it be easy for they to see more patient will the minister meet i to discuss a new modern medical centre for knutsford 
 i thank the right hon member for recognise the significant investment announce today in gp service and building and i would be delighted to ensure that the relevant minister meet she 
 what discussion he have have with staffordshire and stoke on trent integrate care board on patient waiting time 
 drive down waiting time be of this government ’s top priority and my colleague at nhs england continue to keep in regular contact with icb on improve waiting time and deliver the ambition set out in our elective reform plan since july we have cut waiting list by more than across england and by for university hospitals of north midlands and have deliver more appointment 
 i thank the minister for her answer and recognise the herculean effort the department be make to reduce waiting time particularly in stoke on trent but cancer patient who be have treatment at the royal stoke hospital in my constituency have share her story with i from the initial operation it take week for she to be tell that she may have cancerous cell in her lymph node there be a delay in get the ct scan and after the scan she be tell that it would be week before she could meet an oncologist to discuss the result will the minister say a bit more about how the department while reduce wait time to access service will make sure that treatment be give in a timely fashion once someone have a treatment plan 
 i be sorry for the experience that my hon friend ’s constituent have have and he highlight a really important aspect of the patient journey through the system i want he and the house to be assure that we be look at the entire patient journey both into hospital and between hospital we be determined to improve patient experience and quality of care and to get back the patient satisfaction that be squander by the last government 
 what step he be take to tackle hospital backlog 
 reduce hospital backlog be a key priority in this government ’s plan for change as the week standard for elective care have not be meet for almost a decade our elective reform plan set out how we will return to that standard by the end of this parliament through a combination of investment and reform since july the waiting list have reduce by over and we have deliver an extra appointment exceed our manifesto pledge and do it early than plan 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for his answer and for the progress make but there be still more to do my constituent in newcastle under lyme have recently be recover from brain surgery at the royal stoke university hospital however she have face multiple setback due to failure in the duty of care include scald injury and a severely mishandle admission process she be now receive the correct care but she have to wait many month to be admit to the correct ward and have be give limited time for rehabilitative treatment do the secretary of state agree that to tackle backlog our hospital must have the resource they need to provide the right care the time round so that patient be give the time and support to fully and effectively recover 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question and horrify to hear about his constituent ’s experience this government will never brush problem under the carpet or pretend that thing be well than they be and i know that for all the progress we have make in the past month there be still so much more to do when we publish our year plan for health we must ensure that quality and safety be at the heart of every patient interaction my hon friend be right about the need for investment that be why we be invest £ in the nhs and social care and why it be so disappointing that the opposition party vote against it 
 on a recent visit to the breast unit of the royal united hospital in bath specialist tell i about a red flag system that could help to speed up care if someone have a red flag symptom such as a lump or a bleed nipple the triage team can book they straight into the breast clinic rather than wait to see a gp do the secretary of state support such an approach 
 i thank the hon member for her extremely constructive contribution that be exactly why at the heart of our plan for reform and modernisation we be place such an emphasis on digital and technological transformation we have such rich datum about the experience of our patient but we be not use it effectively enough if we use the information more effectively and efficiently we can spot and identify risk much more proactively and ensure that people get timely access to urgent care and treatment when they need it 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for the work that he and his team have do to reduce nhs waiting time month on month for the last month however the backlog that grow under the last conservative government be still impact on my constituent i have listen to   countless constituent who have tell i about the upsetting impact of long waiting time for an adhd diagnosis for child that be have a detrimental knock on impact on access to support include child and adolescent mental health service and share care agreement and there be a lack of support for adopt child i welcome the news that waiting list have go down but will the secretary of state set out how his work will be target at bring down waiting list for adhd diagnose in my constituency to ensure consistency in diagnosis rate across trust 
 i be so grateful to my hon friend for her question and i pay tribute to my right hon friend the secretary of state for education who be lead cross government work in that area we have a taskforce that be specifically look at the issue that my hon friend raise and together we be look to ensure that our education and health service be well join up to meet the need of young people i be work with my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   and draw on his experience to look at how we can improve the health and care of care experience young people and young adult i hope we will have lot of progress to report on those issue 
 way to reduce the backlog be to reduce or put an end to health tourism in this country whereby people come to this country get their treatment and then nip back to where they come from do the secretary of state think it be a good idea that people enter this country should provide evidence of health insurance or be refuse entry 
 when any of we travel abroad we expect to take out travel insurance and pay for our healthcare need overseas and that be the standard that we expect for visitor to our country we have lot more to do to improve on that front i deplore the comment make by the hon gentleman ’s party leader who say that he do not support a taxpayer fund nhs for the british people he might want that debate and the leader of the so call opposition say that she want that debate but as far as labour be concern we be clear about where we stand under labour the nhs will always be a national health service publicly fund and free at the point of use 
 what step he be take to reduce the reliance of the nhs on private healthcare provider 
 this government be take a hard headed approach to cut waiting time we be invest an extra £ in our nhs and where the independent sector have spare capacity we will pay to get nhs patient treat fast and free at the point of use so far our approach to investment and reform have cut waiting list by more than perhaps the hon member will tell we how it be go in scotland 
 the secretary of state claim this morning on bbc radio ’s today programme a most excellent programme that labour be the only party that can be trust with the national health service can he confirm that no aspect of the nhs whatsoever whether it be ownership of the estate the provision of specialist service or any other form of privatisation will be include in the much promise trade deal between the uk and the united states no more excuse secretary of state just give a direct answer to a direct question 
 i have say it before and i will say it again the nhs will be privatised over my dead body this party found the nhs as a publicly fund public service free at the point of use we use the independent sector to cut waiting list and guess what the snp lead government in scotland do the same thing we have make it clear that the nhs be not up for sale in any trade deal that be clear and unequivocal the hon gentleman can sling mud as much as he like but he can not run from the snp ’s abysmal record on the nhs over long poor year 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 gps be at the front door to our nhs today i can announce that we be support more than surgery across the country to modernise their building back by more than £ the big public investment in gp facility for year follow year of neglect this vital funding will create additional space to see more patient boost productivity improve patient care and enable more family doctor appointment each year 
 i very much welcome today ’s announcement on refurbish gp surgery across the country because i have make it my priority to meet with as many gps as possible in my constituency our local gps have tell i that our health centre need more physical space in order to accommodate grow local need and facilitate the expansion of healthcare into the community be the secretary of state willing to meet i and my local gps to discuss how we can well improve the physical space need for care to be bring close to people ’s home 
 i would be delighted to do so since we come into government we have make this announcement today put £ into general practice and agree a contract with gps include reform for patient access and service we be fix the front door to the nhs but of course that will take time we recruit more gps by the end of march but day by day week by week month by month and year by year people should see improvement in their gp service thank to labour 
 i call the shadow minister

 i thank the shadow minister for her constructive question i would be delighted to hear more about that initiative she be absolutely right about timely access to medicine and through a combination of service reform and the modernisation of technology we can assist clinician and patient to help they to manage their medication and ensure that people get timely access to medicine 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer and i would be delighted to meet he to discuss it far 
 unfortunately when labour negotiate britain lose the government capitulate to union demand with nothing in return it be therefore of no surprise to anyone that within month they be back in dispute with resident doctor and the british medical association have announce a ballot for strike action what will the secretary of state do to protect patient and taxpayer 
 i will tell the hon lady what we be not go to do we be not go to see £ waste on strike by resident doctor or cancel operation and appointment which be exactly what happen on the conservatives watch within week we end the strike by resident doctor and we have cut waiting list by as a result as i have say to resident doctor their pay offer will be fair and neither staff nor patient want to go back to the bad old day of strike under the tories they have an unwilling and incalcitrant government under the conservatives who be unwilling to work with resident doctor but we want to work with they to deliver well care for patient 
 i pay tribute to my year old constituent arlo lambie who tragically die on april follow the diagnosis of a grade brain tumour i know arlo he be a fun and bright lad who will be sadly miss while arlo ’s parent ellie and alex wish to put on record their thank for the incredible and compassionate care arlo receive at st mary ’s hospital on the isle of wight they want to know what step the secretary of state be take to improve nhs access to breakthrough treatment to ensure that the commercial interest of pharmaceutical company do not take precedence so that child with brain cancer like arlo be give the good possible chance to survive for long

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in his statement to the house just after christmas the secretary of state acknowledge that cross party consensus be essential to deliver meaningful social care reform the liberal democrats support he in that endeavour but we still do not have a date for those cross party meeting so will he give we now 
 date for meeting with the commission be now a matter for the independent commission 
 west cumbria like many part of the uk be a dental desert in some community urgent dental access centre have prove to be a real success at build up dental service so will the minister support my campaign to introduce an urgent dental access centre in west cumbria 
 the government have launch a scheme to provide urgent dental appointment there be allocate to my hon friend ’s integrate care board he will know that icb be responsible for commission primary care service base on the need of the population but i know that he be a strong campaigner for his constituent i understand that his dialogue with his icb on this matter have be positive and constructive and i be sure that he will continue to fly the flag 
 the chief executive of the royal college of midwives have say that the axing of the maternity safety ringfence pot would be a wreck ball to the effort be make to improve maternity safety just a single or a small group of baby be spar lifelong disability would pay for the cost of that ringfenced pot many time over i know that the secretary of state care about this matter deeply so will he reconsider 
 the funding be still there but as many people have urge i include the right hon gentleman we be take the decision to give more freedom and flexibility to independent care board system and provider to determine how they can well spend nhs resource on service to improve patient care safety and outcome everyone will know that maternity safety be understandably a priority for this government we expect the nhs to deliver on maternity safety standard and will hold it to account on that 
 resident in theale and across my constituency tell i time and again how hard it be to get a gp appointment which cause distress and sometimes dangerous delay will the secretary of state outline how his programme of reform and investment will end the am scramble for good and deliver more gp appointment for my constituent 
 my hon friend will know that we have hire more gps which will help with access we have also renegotiate the contract so there will be online booking system in every practice in the country and we have change the contract to incentivise continuity of care in order to bring back the family doctor there be a suite of reform couple with investment which i hope will deliver for my hon friend ’s constituent 
 of the great frustration for medical professional and patient alike be when patient have appointment but do not turn up what action will the secretary of state take to ensure that the system penalise people who miss appointment so that patient can get the treatment they need when they need it 
 we be absolutely convinced that well use of digital tool will enable we to reduce the number of miss appointment significantly and factor in the likelihood of no show so that we can reduce waste and eliminate inefficiency i understand the case for penalty that the hon gentleman be make but that be not a route we want to go down until we have make those improvement and judge how effective they have be 
 far too many promise make by the last government promise that care would be move out of hospital and into the community turn out to be hollow from speak to resident in dartford i know that hospital and community service have struggle to keep pace with new housing development in the constituency i be pleased to say that later this year in dartford we will be see an expansion of our state of the art community diagnostic centre take care close to where people live do the secretary of state agree that this be the start of labour get on with finally deliver that big shift and will he visit dartford with i 
 order i think minister have get the message if they have not by this stage i would be surprised who be answer 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that this be exactly the sort of thing that be be roll out across the country and that we be commit to deliver care close to where his resident live 
 resident in mid bedfordshire be concerned about the standard of maintenance at our local hospital what action be the government take to support our hospital in luton and bedford to catch up on maintenance backlog 
 thank to the investment that the chancellor commit to we be invest in the nhs estate which be in a sorry state i be afraid that that be an investment that the hon gentleman do not vote for and his constituent will be fume when they find out who be responsible 
 i recently hear from chelsea a constituent of mine who raise concern about her grandmother anna ’s care after a delay discharge she be release with   the wrong equipment which sadly result in she fall out of bed and sustain a further injury ensure that patient be discharge in a safe and timely manner be key to continue the department ’s significant progress in cut waiting list for treatment so what step be the secretary of state take to promote integrate working between service to support discharge into the community for patient 
 i be extremely sorry to hear about that particular case it be really important that we support and facilitate well discharge which be why we be reform the well care fund and look to well integrate health and social care service through our year plan i would be delighted to hear far from my hon friend about what we can do to improve in his area 
 i have a constituent who have break and rot tooth his gp refer he to the local dental hospital but he have be refuse treatment because the hospital say that the surgeon would take a referral only from a dentist which my constituent and many other in somerset just do not have what do the minister suggest my constituent should do to stop the pain 
 as the hon lady know we now have a commitment to provide more urgent dental appointment those who do not have an nhs dentist can call and will be prioritise we be very clear that every integrate care board have a target within those appointment and if they be not hit that target we will want to know why 
 as someone with adhd it be disappointing to hear from many of my constituent about difficulty in access diagnosis medication and other therapeutic input for adhd and the impact on their life and livelihood as a result whether for child or adult wait of or year be become the norm what step be the government take to make sure that individual can exercise their right to choose 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for improve support for adhd and recognise the valuable perspective that she bring through her live experience this government inherit a broken nhs with too many people face long wait for an assessment nhs england ’s adhd taskforce be look at how support for people with adhd can be improve i look forward to read its report and i recently have a very productive meeting with the director of that taskforce 
 the government have commit to provide extra emergency dental appointment but in the midland the unit of dental activity rate be just and there be no additional funding for the integrate care board will the minister therefore give assurance to my constituent that he will fully deliver on that promise 
 i give the hon member that assurance we have be clear that every icb have a target and that be transparently publish and we will be monitor it i be hold regular meeting with official to check   that every single icb be on track to hit those target if icb be not on track to hit those target we will want to know why 
 early this year i meet the cockermouth and maryport primary care network which tell i about the increase challenge of support my constituent with their mental health have the secretary of state consider relax the additional role reimbursement scheme funding rule to allow mental health nurse to be employ wholly by a pcn and not need to be under the employment of a local mental health trust that flexibility could help gp practice to intervene early and reduce referral to secondary care quickly 
 we have in fact relax the rule on arrs so that a mental health worker can be employ by the pcn my hon friend be absolutely right that that be an important part of step from hospital to community but there be more we can do on that we continue to do whatever we can to ensure that mental health and gp surgery be actively integrate 
 get it right time be a clinician lead programme that lead on improvement and transformation can the secretary state give reassurance that in any restructuring of nhs england that programme will not just be continue but expand and still available to the devolved administration 
 i be absolutely willing to give the hon member that commitment and i know he work on this programme in his previous role in northern ireland it be deliver result and we want to see result we want to take the good to the rest of the nhs and we absolutely want to work together across the united kingdom to make sure that all our resident benefit from the programme

 i agree with my hon friend we be make great stride in develop our cancer plan we will be launch a national cancer plan later this year and the target lung cancer screening programme have be particularly effective the snp have have a record settlement for holyrood and we expect the scottish government to deliver if they can not i be sure that anas sarwar and jackie baillie would be willing to take over 
 yesterday ’s report from the health and social care committee be explicit that we can not build an nhs fit for the future without effectively reform social care back in january the secretary of state promise cross party talk as well as baroness casey ’s commission he can not outsource   political leadership to baroness casey political will be the stick point with the reform of social care will he show that leadership and bring the party together to find the solution to unblock this crisis 
 since we come into government we have already take action on social care with the investment we have put in the big expansion of carer ’s allowance and the funding for home adaptation through the disabled facility grant now that the commission be up and run there will be cross party engagement but it be an independent commission and for baroness casey to decide how to engage 
 last week this labour government announce the freezing of prescription charge put pound back in the pocket of people in derby i have visit pharmacy include the littleover pharmacy which provide essential care and support for their community the conservatives underfunde pharmacy and more than close across england between and what be the minister do to support community pharmacy so that we do not lose these vital local service 
 after year of neglect this government have agree with the sector a record uplift to £ for for this vitally important front door to our nhs we be also support pharmacy to operate more efficiently include enable hub and speak dispense between all pharmacy later this year i be pleased to say that the legislation for that have be lay what a contrast that be with the previous year i be also pleased to see that the national pharmacy association have withdraw its view on take collective action we be move in the right direction but there be still a lot more to do 
 i welcome today ’s announcement of new money for gps surgery but gps in my constituency tell i that they can not get capital out of the integrate care board and that the valuation office agency consistently undervalue the cost of rent make future building impossible will the secretary of state agree to meet i and gps from my constituency in order to understand the problem well 
 thank to the investment that we have announce those practice will be upgrade i advise the hon gentleman to engage with his local icb we be happy to receive representation if we can help but let i gently point out that the investment be only possible thank to the decision make by the chancellor which he oppose 
 ladies walk nhs health centre in sedgley be a vital hub for my constituent provide essential service such as phlebotomy and diabetic foot care but owe to the inaction of the conservative council this much need community asset face closure in leave resident without access to critical care will my hon friend agree to meet i to discuss urgent step to safeguard the future of the centre and ensure that sedgley resident continue to receive the nhs service on which they rely 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who be a qualified physiotherapist and who be right to refer to the value of community care i would be happy to meet she to discuss the important issue that she have raise 
 what step will be take to support more community pharmacy that can offer a broad range of service to people in rural area to ensure that those who be most isolated from busy town still have access to those important service 
 as i say early we be give pharmacy a record uplift to £ and i be pleased to confirm that of all the sector in the nhs they receive the good uplift in the settlement we have also maintain the pharmacy access scheme which provide £ to support pharmacy in area where there be few of they include the rural area that the hon gentleman mention 
 pharmacy play a key role in community in rural area such as mine but it be deeply frustrating when the supply chain break down and a pharmacy can not deliver its medicine can the minister tell i where we be now with the supply chain will she also thank all the heroic worker up and down the country who be do their very good to deliver medicine and will she thank in particular the superdrug worker in my constituency who be try to make the supply chain work 
 i be pleased to congratulate the pharmacy that be on the frontline on their hard work and also to congratulate all those in the department and elsewhere who ensure that our supply chain be as resilient as possible i know that this issue concern many member and many of our constituent and we hope to arrange a parliamentary event to ensure that member have more information those people do a great deal of work we know that the issue be important and i will update the house on other measure that we intend to take to ensure that member and their constituent be well inform 
 last month i begin to receive concern email from employee of the nhs trust in my constituency say that the trust be seek to create a subsidiary company and move staff into it they be really worried about their future right i know how important it be to the secretary of state that people have good employment right what step be he take to ensure that there be full consultation with staff before the creation of subsidiary and to prevent the creation of tier employment practice in the nhs with no continuity of service 
 while i understand the desirability of such arrangement for nhs trust this government be absolutely clear that staff must be in receipt of good nhs term and condition and must feel part of the nhs workforce and the nhs family i would be happy to receive further representation from the hon lady 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on the series of national security relate arrest that take place on   saturday may protect our national security be the duty of government and it be a testament to our world lead law enforcement and intelligence service that through their tireless commitment so many plot against the uk have be thwart i pay tribute to they again today for the work that they have do not just this weekend but in recent week and month on these important operation 
 the operation that take place across multiple location this weekend be significant and complex they be some of the large counter state threat and counter terrorism action that we have see in recent time and i be sure the whole house will want to join i in thank the police the security service and other partner agency across the country who show their professionalism and expertise in carry out these operation to keep our country safe 
 right hon and hon member will understand that these be complex investigation the police and the security service need time and space to be able to pursue their investigation and our priority must be to protect the integrity of that work so that we do not cut across those investigation and operation at a crucial time however these be serious matter and the house will rightly want to remain informed i will therefore outline as much detail as i be able and i hope that right hon and hon member will understand that there be a strict limit to what i can say at this stage give that investigation be now ongoing 
 i will outline the fact around the event on   saturday may throughout the day counter terrorism police undertake a series of arrest relate to separate investigation in total man be arrest by the metropolitan police ’s counter terrorism command man be arrest on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act contrary to section of the terrorism act as part of a proactive investigation in the area of west london swindon rochdale stockport and manchester all man be iranian national while of the individual remain in police custody the have now be bail with strict condition 
 as part of the investigation police officer carry out search at a number of address in the greater manchester london and swindon area investigation continue with search and activity still under way at multiple address across the country the investigation relate to a suspect plot to target specific premise police officer have be in contact with the affect site ’s representative to make they aware and provide relevant security advice and support however the police have also be clear that for reason of operational security and public safety they be not and i be not able to provide further information on the target at this time and i urge member not to speculate about the site 
 in a separate police investigation man be arrest at different address in north west london and man be arrest at an address in west london all be arrest under the national security act these man be also iranian national and   remain in police custody i can confirm to the house that these be the iranian national arrest under the national security act 
 the operation to execute these arrest under both counter terror and counter state threat power in different part of the country and in the space of hour be intensive they involve a range of different organisation include different police force counter terror police the national crime agency and our security and intelligence service these operation be co ordinated through the world lead counter terrorism operations centre which bring together and co ordinate the uk ’s agency alongside the agency of our eyes partner to detect and tackle national security threat i welcome the work of the previous government to establish ctoc in and this government have continue to support it and invest in it since take office 
 the significant point about both counter terrorism and counter state threat power be that they allow the police to intervene early to prevent and disrupt threat not just respond after event have take place this be crucial for public safety but it also make the investigation more complex and that be why the police need the time and space to pursue they now so we will not be provide a run commentary on the work that they be do however what now follow be an incredibly complex set of investigation involve hundred more officer carry out forensic search collect vital evidence across different site across the country and secure witness statement back up by the continue effort of our security and intelligence agency this be careful painstaking work 
 at this stage in the operation and investigation it would not be appropriate for i to speculate on or comment far on the detail of these case and the motivation behind any of the threat that be pose however the house will be aware that these operation come against a backdrop of complex interconnect threat to the uk where state threat and counter terrorism as well as serious and organised crime be intertwine together 
 for year the great focus of our national security work be on terrorism primarily from islamist terrorism with additional threat from northern ireland relate terrorism and other area and those threat have not go away terrorist attack have take place since and there have be late stage disruption of terrorism plot but alongside that we have see a serious grow and complex challenge from state threat last year sir ken mccallum the director general of mi5 say that mi5 state threat investigation have increase by in the previous month he add that since january the police and mi5 have respond to iran back plot present potentially lethal threat 
 in march i tell parliament that the uk be face a grow and evolve threat from malign activity carry out by a number of state my statement in march outline the government ’s response to the unacceptable threat that we face from the iranian state and the step we be take to ensure that our intelligence and law enforcement agency have the tool they need to disrupt and degrade iran ’s malign activity on uk soil we have deliver on the commitment make i announce that the whole of the iranian state include the islamic revolutionary guard corps and the ministry of   intelligence and security would be place on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme i lay the regulation to make this happen in the house on   april   and commit to bring the scheme into force on   july i trust that all member will vote in favour when those regulation be debate shortly 
 let i be clear anyone in the uk who work for the iranian state must declare it or they will be commit a serious criminal offence we will also go after the criminal network and enabler that iran use to carry out its work last month the government sanction the foxtrot network a network involve in violence against jewish and israeli target in europe on behalf of the iranian regime training and guidance on state threat activity be now be offer by counter terrorism police to all territorial police force across the uk 
 the independent reviewer of terrorism and state threat legislation jonathan hall kc be ask by the home secretary to review the part of our counter terrorism framework that could be apply to modern day state threat such as those from iran the home secretary specifically ask the reviewer to look at a state threat proscription tool so we be not hold back by limitation in apply counter terrorism legislation to state threat jonathan hall have now complete his review and will publish it shortly and the government will not hesitate to take action in response to mr hall ’s advice 
 as we continue to support the police and the security service in their investigation i can also tell the house that the home secretary have instigate a series of security assessment that be be do or refresh in the light of the case this weekend and the further information surround they which will ensure that the government can respond robustly and comprehensively to any wide national security issue raise by these case 
 work alongside our international ally to counter state threat be central to our success the foreign office be engage with our close ally to outline the disruptive action that have take place and will be consider potential future response option as the investigation progress the home secretary remain in close contact with my right hon friend the foreign secretary who be committed to do everything necessary to protect the country from these threat and to bring to bear all the diplomatic tool at our disposal 
 the home secretary and ministers will provide an update on the national security position when we be able to do so follow both these operation and investigation and the wide security assessment that be under way the government will not hesitate to act robustly to respond to these plot at the appropriate time but we must allow the investigation to continue our police security and intelligence agency be the good in the world and stand ready at all time to take action to keep our country safe i be sure they will have the support of the whole house as they continue this vital work i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for provide advance sight of his statement on this critical issue people will have read the deeply   concern report suggest that an attack may have be just hour away and this will understandably be worry to people across the country 
 this statement remind we of the tragic incident that have plague our country in the past this month mark year since the death of lee rigby on our street as well as year since the horrific manchester arena bombing later this year we will also mark the anniversary of the attack which bring to london a level of destruction that many of we never think we would see in our lifetime these act of terror along with other cowardly act cause untold hurt to victim and their family 
 as we discuss the arrest over the past weekend we must remember the importance of keep the british public safe from those who seek to terrorise we and i therefore pay tribute to the hard work member of the police and intelligence service for their bravery in disrupt terrorist activity in october the head of mi5 say that the police and mi5 have together disrupt late stage attack plot since the manchester bombing we must remember that each of these case be not merely a statistic but represent someone ’s life and someone ’ future 
 i commend the minister for recognise the work of the previous government and for acknowledge the measure that be use effectively in this incident in turn we will support measure that enact the national security act and give the government the power need to act against malign influence on our country 
 turn to the incident at hand i would be grateful if the minister could clarify certain point while i be thankful for today ’s statement i hope the government will be as transparent as possible about the detail to avoid the vacuum of information we have previously discuss in this place while i appreciate that the government do not want to provide a running commentary like many other member i would be grateful if the government could be as open as possible give the seriousness of the arrest 
 as the minister have outline there be separate arrest of iranian national in relation to terror offence which have raise serious question about how their network be form and what their intention be can the minister provide any further information about the suspect for example while we know they be iranian national what be their immigration status be the state aware that these individual be in the uk and be there any prior indication of the risk they might pose 
 on the broad issue of iran while i understand that the minister may not be able to comment on proscription directly the home secretary do address this while in opposition 
 in july she tell the royal united services institute that 
 instead of try and fail to use counter terror legislation to proscribe organisation like wagner or irgc we will introduce a bespoke proscribing mechanism to address state sponsor threat 
 she also say at the dispatch box in april that labour want 
 appropriately target proscription style restriction on the operation of state link organisation such as the irgc.”—[official report   april vol c. 
 however it be only in march of this year that the minister for security announce the review by jonathan hall do he share my concern that these mixed signal and the delay suggest a lack of prioritisation by the government ultimately we must all work together to ensure that the uk adopt the strong possible stance on national security as cross party co operation be essential i urge the government to take every possible step to prevent these cowardly act of terror 
 i thank the shadow minister for the sensible reasonable and constructive tone of his response he be absolutely right to draw the house ’s attention to the tragic death of lee rigby the tragic bombing in manchester and of course the anniversary of the bombing that we will be commemorate in a couple of month time 
 let i join the shadow minister in pay tribute to all those who work tirelessly to keep our country safe it be of the great privilege of this particular role that we have the opportunity to serve in government as conservative members will also have do and to work closely alongside those incredibly commit member of the police and the intelligence service we owe they a debt of gratitude 
 i be also grateful for the opportunity that the shadow minister have afford i to offer our thank for the work that be do by the previous government both in introduce the national security act which have prove to be an incredibly valuable tool and in create ctoc which be deliver very significant operational value i can absolutely give an assurance that this government like the previous will continue to invest in that institution 
 the shadow minister make an important point about transparency and i can give he the reassurance that he seek he and the house will understand that we be just a couple of day on from those arrest that take place on saturday the home secretary will provide a further update as soon as we be operationally able to do so i give the shadow minister a commitment that we will be as transparent as possible while of course ensure that we do not cut across live counter terrorism operation 
 the shadow minister mention proscription and i understand why i know that he will acknowledge or at least i hope that he will that on   march   i announce a very strong suite of measure design to most effectively address the nature of the threat that we face from iran contain within those measure be a request from the home secretary for jonathan hall who i know be hold in very high regard because of the experience and credibility that he have in this area to look very carefully at the legislative framework that might enable we to more effectively proscribe state base entity i can confirm that mr hall have complete his report and that the home secretary and i be consider it very carefully it will be publish shortly i assure the shadow minister that we will not hesitate to act if there be a requirement to bring forward further measure 
 the minister will be aware that a number of iranian citizen in this country still have relative in iran and it be not beyond the wit of the iranian government to use that pressure on they in require the citizen of iran in this country to report to our government if they be in any way   connect to the iranian government have he take measure to protect they from expose their family to the pressure that the iranian government may put on they 
 my hon friend raise a very important point and i can give he the assurance he seek the government have be very carefully consider the matter of transnational repression the home secretary and i will have more to say in the near future but i can give he absolute assurance that we have be think carefully about these matter and take they incredibly seriously 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for update the house and for advance sight of his statement i also add my thank to the security service and the police for all their work to keep we safe 
 over recent year member have be call to this chamber to discuss plot to commit act of terror on britain ’s street at the hand of the iranian regime but consecutive government be yet to proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps as a terrorist organisation in opposition the now foreign secretary say 
 the irgc be behave like a terrorist organisation and must now be proscribe as such 
 early this year i ask the minister precisely this question do he not agree that now be surely the time in his early remark he mention the review that have conclude if now be not the time for proscription when should the house expect a further update 
 the liberal democrats have welcome previous sanction against those link to the iranian regime however i urge the government to go a step far and look closely at whether those individual and other with link to the regime have asset here in the uk will the minister commit to carry out an audit so that we know where those asset be enable the government to freeze they as appropriate the minister be right to reference the long stand pattern by the iranian intelligence service of target people of the jewish faith and of israeli nationality could he update the house on any conversation he have have with the uk jewish community leadership specifically the community security trust about threat here in the uk 
 i thank the hon lady for as be always the case the very sensible and reasonable way in which she have phrase her question i be always available to discuss these matter in more detail should she wish to do so to her question on proscription i hope she will acknowledge the response i give to the shadow minister a few moment ago
