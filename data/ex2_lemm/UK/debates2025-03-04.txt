i welcome the minister ’s statement the israelis have do a huge amount to dismantle iran ’s influence in the middle east so will the minister ensure that we carry on give isreal the support to ensure iran be not able to re establish that influence in some area through hezbollah and hamas will he also ensure that british company be not supply component to iran through a series of country with which they can trade and that we be able to achieve our stated objective on that supply chain 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what step she plan to take to encourage save 
 the government be commit to support people to save and invest and we want to build a well investment culture currently of people with saving income do not pay tax on it as we announce at the budget from next month we will expand the help to save scheme to all universal credit claimant in work 
 the nation ’s favourite way to save be through premium bond do the minister think that they be good for the country and a valuable way of encourage saving for everyone who have they they be quite exciting every month 
 i think that premium bond do provide excitement not least in my parent household where they be very popular they be already well promote and popular and we have see annual investment in premium bond increase by more than since march the fund raise through they go towards support vital public service 
 i warmly welcome the government ’s commitment to extend the help to save scheme which have be run for year martin lewis describe it as 
 a very clever scheme and that will work for many people 
 may i urge the minister to look at what need to be do to raise awareness of it because the actual uptake be very low give that the government have be give £ over year it be critical that the right investment in promote it happen because it be such a brilliant scheme 
 i could not agree with of my predecessor more the right hon gentleman be absolutely correct it be a great scheme and now that we be expand it we will take that opportunity to promote it well 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 we all know how important it be to encourage saving because so many people be a paycheque away from poverty but there have be a lot of discussion about lazy capital in cash only isa for example and other saving account i know there be a drive by government to see great investment would the minister like to expand on the government ’s thought on that in particular can she make any comment about the security of the cash isa 
 cash saving provide a vital source of saving for a rainy day and we recognise that equally we want to build a well investment culture in our society so that it be not just the of people who can afford financial advice who can have the opportunity of well reward by invest in british company and other in our economy 
 on that point it have be widely report that the chancellor be plan to slash the amount of cash that saver can save in isa from £ to £ a year will the chancellor rule out this punitive measure which will see saving drop and push even more people into income tax 
 we be committed to promote saving and investment as i say in an early answer measure we be look at be the financial conduct authority ’s review of the advice guidance boundary as i say in a previous answer i do not want it just to be the of people who can afford financial advice who reap the reward of invest in our economy we keep all taxis under review 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the city of london have be a leader of innovation in the world of finance and saving for a few year now and it have be successful because it have always seize opportunity and innovation when present in that spirit we be pleased that the chancellor in her mansion house speech embrace the concept of security tokenisation but we now find that the catalyst for this innovation in the uk a pilot for the digital gilt instrument know as digit have find itself in a year black hole innovation be not something that can hang around for year so will the minister give assurance that she will do everything she can to deliver digit as soon as possible 
 that sound like a criticism of the previous government i can reassure the hon gentleman that we be commit to innovation and to digit

 what step she have take to help increase economic growth in the east of england

 the government ’s decision to increase defence spending be not only an ironclad commitment to national security in the face of generational challenge but an investment in british industry able to unlock new job and opportunity across the country industry in the east of england have a significant defence sector which receive £ of government investment last year can the chancellor explain how the additional defence funding have the potential to benefit my constituent in thurrock as well as those in the wide region 
 as my hon friend say defence have an important role to play in the growth mission as well as keep our country safe and secure and on friday the defence secretary and i host a roundtable at raf waddington in lincoln to announce a new defence innovation hub to harness that potential defence have a strong presence in many of our constituency indeed accord to the most recent datum ministry of defence spending in the east of england account for £ and down the road from my hon friend ’s constituency be the historic mod shoeburyness range which along with other site be operate by the mod and qinetiq as part of a long term partnership worth more than £ in the year to come there will be more investment in defence from both the public and the private sector 
 as part of their pursuit of the ever elusive goal of economic growth the government have rebrande the uk infrastructure bank as the national wealth fund even the office for budget responsibility have cast doubt on the effectiveness of that as a driver of economic growth can the chancellor tell the house how much the rebrand have cost 
 the national wealth fund be do important work in enable we to leverage in private sector investment the most recent of those investment include mine in cornwall and energy charging point in our road at the end of last week i announce that the fund would play a more important role in funding and support investment in the defence sector which will become even more important in the year ahead 
 i recently visit a business in kirkby in ashfield in the east midland funnily enough i do not see   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   there where i be tell that the increase in national insurance contribution would cost the business £ a year which will prevent it from recruit people and give its employee a pay rise next year do the chancellor agree that it be time to reverse this ridiculous decision and help to drive growth in the east midland 
 in the budget in october i have to fill the £ black hole leave by the previous government but there be huge opportunity to grow the economy in the east midland we recently agree the £ unity deal with rolls royce to support the royal navy submarine fleet which will provide a major boost for economic growth in the east midland create and maintain long term job that be good for our country ’s security and good for the people of the east midland 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan increase in employer national insurance contribution on economic growth 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan increase in employer national insurance contribution on economic growth 
 the government have take difficult decision to repair the public finance fund public service and restore economic stability the office for budget responsibility predict that the employer national insurance contribution change 
 will reduce the level of potential output by per cent at the forecast horizon 
 it also predict that growth will pick up next year and that living standard will rise fast during this parliament than during the last and in the long term it expect the autumn budget policy if sustain to increase the size of the economy permanently 
 my constituent alison run stepping stones nursery school which have be operate in my constituency for year offer wraparound care to busy family the increase in employer national insurance contribution alone will cost it £ a year and it be still struggle with an increase in utility cost while other nursery in the area be also struggle and indeed closing headmaster a hairdresser in walton be struggle with £ of extra cost owe primarily to this tax rise can the minister explain to business in esher and walton how the government ’s national insurance policy will deliver growth or high living standard give that it seem to be do neither 
 the government ’s decision to increase employer national insurance contribution be of the tough decision that we take at the budget but it be necessary to restore stability to the public finance it be only on the basis of have stable public finance and fiscal responsibility that we can boost the investment and growth that will make people across britain well off 
 as the poor growth figure show the chancellor ’s job tax be really hurt business not least in our hospitality sector in my constituency pub such as the eel pie and the king ’s head as well as the family run restaurant shambles be really struggle with soar cost and put off hire people if the chancellor will not reverse her job tax will she at the very least consider extend the current business rate relief for hospitality until the new system that she have announce be in place 
 the hon member speak about business rate relief we have to remember that the business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure be due to end entirely in april under the plan we inherit from the conservative party despite the tough of contexts we decide to extend the relief for another year before the permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure come in from april 
 do the minister agree that planning reform be essential for high growth and low taxis be he like i concern that the anti growth opposition we see before we in this house will vote against the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill which be possibly the most significant piece of pro growth legislation that this parliament will see in decade 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the centrality of plan reform to get the economy grow indeed of the action that the chancellor announce on take office be to scrap the ban on onshore wind turbine in the planning system which have be hold back our clean energy transition i hope that some opposition members might take the opportunity during today ’s question to confirm that they will support our reform to the planning system because they be indeed vital to growth in this country 
 do the minister agree that it be in the interest of business to see waiting list in the nhs reduce road repair and the public finance fix do he agree that if opposition party do not agree with labour ’s plan they should set out how they would pay for such improvement 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that stability in the public finance be crucial to ensure that we boost investment and growth across the country he be also right to point out that have public service back on their foot after year of decline under the conservative party in government be essential not only to make people in this country healthier more able to get around and well off but to get our economy grow because it be on that basis that business will invest 
 i call the shadow minister 
 even before labour ’s job tax come into force we can see the damage that it be do quarter of a job in hospitality will be subject to employer national insurance for the time cost £ give that major hospitality and retail business be warn that lower pay and part time worker will suffer most will the chancellor think again can the minister at least commit that there will be no further increase during this parliament 
 the business to which the hon gentleman refer like business in all sector of the economy benefit from the stability that this government have bring to the economy he want to talk about unemployment and the rate of job we recognise that make change to employer national insurance contribution be a tough decision that will have consequence but the unemployment rate will fall to next year and remain low until when take together the budget measure mean that the employment level in this country will increase from in to in 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 health and wealth be side of the same coin and we will not get economic growth without a healthy population but as a result of the national insurance contribution change the care provider alliance report that of social care provider will have to refuse new care package from local authority or the nhs and that will have to hand back exist contract what assurance can the government provide to the huge number of people who be very scared that they will have to go without care and see their life deteriorate 
 the hon lady make an important point but it be also important to point out that tough decision on taxation must be make to fund the very service she be keen to support on her specific point about these pressure we announce at the provisional local government settlement a furth £ for adult and child ’s social care to support authority in deliver key service this will be allocate through the social care grant which will bring the total increase in this grant in to £ mean that up to £ of additional funding will be provide to social care authority in 
 minister will be aware of analysis from the nuffield trust show that that additional grant be be dwarf by the additional cost that the government be introduce 
 on the great british high street we know that our high street be beautiful feature of our city market town and village but hospitality retail beauty and other service sector be say that the combination of national insurance and other change will be a real hammer blow if high street shop start to close that be bad for economic growth and bad for confidence what mechanism will ministers put in place to monitor the impact of the national insurance contribution change on the vibrancy and resilience of our high street 
 all measure in the budget be of course analyse by the treasury and the office for budget responsibility ahead of their announcement and we keep in constant contact with industry representative to see how policy be work in practice i draw her attention to my early remark to her hon friend   the member for twickenham munira wilson   about our business rate reform which be a vital ask from the retail hospitality and leisure sector after year of chop and change from the conservative party change relief from year to the next and offer no stability whatever to people in that sector we be introduce permanently low rate for the retail hospitality and leisure sector from april and avoid the complete end of relief that the conservative party leave in the in tray when we arrive in office 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase economic growth through new transport infrastructure 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase economic growth through new transport infrastructure 
 the growth mission be the central mission of this government and transport be an important enabler of that growth the spending review deliver a £ cash increase to the transport budget in compare with represent real term growth with record spending further announcement will be make in the spending review 
 in my constituency stevenage borough council be work to secure job and opportunity with town centre regeneration under way and over council home deliver but outdated infrastructure be hold back growth business have be clear with i that upgrade stevenage station gateway would unlock growth with the prospect of job be deliver and a £ benefit to the economy each year will my right hon friend meet i to discuss how we can make the most of this opportunity to unlock economic growth through more infrastructure investment 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that invest in infrastructure will enable growth in city town and village across the whole of our united kingdom we will set out further detail alongside the spending review in our year infrastructure strategy in june no doubt stevenage be sit between london and the oxford cambridge corridor will benefit enormously from announcement already make but decision on specific scheme will be take by the department for transport follow the spending review 
 the midland rail hub project would represent major investment in rail infrastructure across the west midland crucially it would mean more frequent train on the cross city line which serve lichfield before the pandemic that be the busy commuter line in the country outside london what assurance can minister give i and my constituent that more train will be come on this line and come soon 
 i thank my hon friend who be a strong champion for his constituency for raise this rail project in relation to such project the case that he have make will be an important part of our consideration in the month ahead as part of the spending review i will arrange for he to meet the appropriate transport minister as we make those consideration 
 the great university city of york and hull be unusual in that they do not have a direct rail line between they the whole region labour mp liberal democrat councillor conservatives be unite in believe that reopen the beverley to york line so that the great minster of hull and york can be reconnecte would bring economic growth and a bright future for the area will the minister agree to meet i and colleague to discuss this project and how it could help unlock the growth that we all seek across the house 
 i be sorry to hear that the right hon gentleman fail to persuade his party when in government for year to open that line i can reassure he that this government take rail infrastructure seriously and i will happily consider any detail that he wish to write to i about 
 economic growth through infrastructure development could be help in scotland and northern ireland with more money go to cairnryan port and the road infrastructure to it ally to that any help that the department the minister and the chancellor could give in resolve eu relate trading issue would considerably help northern ireland business as well as scottish business 
 the hon member will know that the government have enter negotiation with our counterpart in the european commission to improve trade between the uk and the european union i have a great meeting to discuss these issue last week in cardiff with finance ministers from the northern ireland executive as well as from scotland and wales and note that we have give a record break increase in funding to the devolved government so that they can get on with such project work in partnership with we where we still have responsibility 
 what step she have take to increase regional growth in england 
 what fiscal reform she have make to help increase economic growth in cumbria 
 at autumn budget we set out the major step in our approach to regional growth through devolution investment and reform the january growth speech regional investment package build on that we have make clear the government ’s focus on attract inward investment across the country and to invest in infrastructure need to support city and region to grow we have make it clear that the importance of invest in major city region across the uk will play   an important part in that endeavour for example if we improve the productivity gap in manchester birmingham and leeds we estimate we can deliver an extra £ in economic output 
 i call graham stringer interruption 
 sorry mr speaker i be nearly as shock when you call i as i be when listen to the chancellor of the exchequer on radio talk about economic growth she say there have not be a new runway build in this country since manchester airport would be very surprised to hear that because its new runway have be operate for nearly year i be shock by that but not really surprised because i think many official in the treasury who advise her show a startling ignorance of the english region and that lead to a certain prejudice in the formula they use to calculate whether a scheme should go ahead can the minister and the rest of the treasury team provide coach to send treasury official around the english region to talk to people who know about growth secondly will he look at the formula that decide where economic growth happen which be bias against the region 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i will do my good to answer they i can confirm that treasury official routinely engage with local and regional official across the country include frequently in manchester with mayor burnham and his team i would point my hon friend gently to some of the announcement make by the chancellor include support for the old trafford development in manchester i congratulate the operator of manchester airport on run a successful business which we will continue to support in the normal way 
 at the autumn budget the government announce a range of support measure for small business include vital support for the retail hospitality and leisure sector will the minister confirm the measure be take to support the independent and important craft brewing and distillery sector in cumbria 
 as the house have already hear today from my hon friend the exchequer secretary to the treasury we have make permanent decision to give business in the retail hospitality and leisure sector certainty that their discount will apply to business rate relief for the long term not just on a year rolling temporary basis as be the case for year under the previous government i understand from my hon friend   the member for barrow and furness michelle scrogham   that the like of shed gin wolftown and kin vodka in cumbria will benefit enormously from the government ’s policy i look forward to visit those establishment with she in due course 
 the golden valley development in cheltenham will bring significant growth to the west it will also back our national security by support gchq now that the chancellor have approve an extra of defence spending for intelligence and cyber will she work with colleague in the ministry of defence the department for science innovation and technology and the cabinet office to agree more funding   for this nationally significant development if the defence point be not good enough we could point out that the development will unlock a lot of nice new house too 
 i visit airbus in newport last week to look at some of the advanced technology we have in this space i be tell about the important connection between newport and the hon gentleman ’s region with gchq and the industrial impact that it have on the supply chain in the uk the increase spending on defence announce by the prime minister will have a significant positive impact for business such as those and for his region we look forward to set out further detail of that spending in the spending review 
 the marches region of which north shropshire be a significant part be hold back by the a483 road run between llanymynech and oswestry which be very dangerous there be frequent crash and hold up on it which both hinder local growth and obviously be a danger to life for people live in the area will the minister work with his colleague in the department for transport to ensure that if we can not get a bypass we at least get vital improvement on that road 
 i can commit to work with dft colleague on project such as that and other around the country as we make decision in the upcoming spending review i would make an observation that it be not just about the decision on spending there have be problem in the past where decision have be make and u turn and then make and u turn again that be difficult for the supply chain and difficult for investor and local community in our multi year capital budget and our year infrastructure strategy which be come in the month ahead we will give stability to the uk economy so that we can get on and deliver project such as the the hon lady mention 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the chancellor have laud the new national wealth fund as a key part of the government ’s regional growth ambition the trouble be it be not actually new it be just the uk infrastructure bank with a new colour scheme and £ it do not need the prime minister announce at a recent labour party political conference that he will allocate £ from the national wealth fund for grangemouth but it be suppose to be operationally independent will the minister therefore confirm that that be still the case and that the full independent investment process be follow will he also confirm that the unexpected resignation of the national wealth fund ceo just day before that announcement be not connect 
 i find it odd that member on the conservative benches do not welcome an additional £ of investment into our economy it be rather a testament to their poor performance on investment over many year in government to answer the hon gentleman ’s specific question i can confirm that each of the business case for grangemouth will have to go through the normal process for sign off and that john flint leave the national wealth fund be not in any   way connect to the decision take by this government we look forward to appoint his successor in due course 
 what step she be take to encourage investment in newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend constituency 
 this be an important question when shockingly household income in the north east hardly grow over the long year of the previous conservative government we need to raise public and private investment which be why we be work with the north east combine authority on its local growth plan the office for investment be work particularly closely with the north east alongside liverpool on develop local growth opportunity 
 with the town ’s access to the world ’s big offshore wind farm a cluster of advanced manufacturing firm and an expand energy skill academy more of newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend ’s potential be yet to be tap what discussion be the minister have with the energy secretary to ensure that the investment be there and that green supply chain be anchor in place such as tyneside 
 i have spend far too much of my life talk to the now energy secretary but my hon friend be right to highlight the potential of green energy supply chain in her constituency and across the north east this be a government commit to secure economic gain alongside energy security from the energy transition in stark contrast to the previous government who think the net transition be something on which to create dividing line not job 
 what step she have take with cabinet colleague to increase the supply of affordable housing 
 at budget the government announce major step towards deliver a once in a generation increase in social housing include a £ boost to the affordable home programme increase annual spend to £ the big annual budget for affordable housing in more than a decade early this month the government also announce an additional £ to fund affordable home that be the difference a labour government can make to people across the country wait desperately for secure housing further investment decision will be set out at phase of the spending review 
 will the minister join i in pay tribute to the lancaster guardian for its recent investigative report into the reality for many family live in temporary accommodation in the lancaster district that be pair with a frustration i hear from local house building developer over delay in the planning process in the   district what more do the minister think can happen in lancaster to ensure that family in the district actually have secure housing 
 my hon friend know that we be do everything possible in this place to streamline and improve planning legislation and planning process we be provide clear signal to everybody across the country that we need to build and build rapidly not least to meet our housing target local council play an important role in this process as they make decision on local development i understand that in lancaster city council she have have some struggle with member of the green party who be become blocker as oppose to builder i say to they and to people across the country that they need to get behind the build agenda because that be what the british people vote for 
 to what extent be the chancellor concerned about multiple potential breach by his majesty ’s revenue and customs of its charter since it issue spotlight which impact rental housing supply and be cause real concern among my constituent both landlord and tenant will the minister meet i urgently to discuss this matter 
 i be afraid that i have no idea what the answer be but if the right hon gentleman write to i i shall make sure that he get an answer 
 what step she be take to help ensure value for money in public spending 
 the government be commit to spend taxpayer money efficiently at the autumn budget we launch the office for value for money to realise benefit   from every pound of public spending through phase   of the spending review departments be set a productivity efficiency and saving target to ensure that every pound of taxpayer money be well spend the next phase of the spending review have go far i have ask each department to conduct a line by line review of exist day to day budget to identify where spending be no long align with this government ’s priority or be poor value for money 
 i thank the minister for his answer as a member of the public accounts committee i see on a weekly basis the waste that exist under the previous government from the billion spend on badly procure covid contract to a rwanda scheme that deliver nothing what step will the minister be take to make sure that we deal not only with value for money for the taxpayer but the legacy of waste under the previous government 
 my hon friend be absolutely right interruption conservative member be chuntere but that be their legacy not once in year be a base review do not once do former conservative ministers require their departments to go line by line through their budget and not once do they think that the responsible thing to do be to go through to check   how every pound of taxpayer money be spend instead there be an argument each year how much more money be i go to get how much more borrowing will there be to pay for these bill and how many more promise be i go to make that i know i will not deliver the british people be sick to death of that approach to politic and this government be take a fundamentally different approach 
 the adoption and special guardianship support fund provide excellent value for money in mid sussex for beacon house which be a specialist mental health and trauma clinic unfortunately however the clinic ’s financial future be look uncertain do the minister agree that invest in mental health be always a good idea when it come to get people back to work and well again and able to contribute to society will the minister work with the department for education to secure future funding for this vital service 
 i agree entirely that mental health service be in desperate need of investment and support across the country the evidence be very clear that there be for example too many people out of work who would be like to be in work but who be wait at home unwell and unable to receive the support and service that they need and deserve the health secretary be work hard on that at the moment we be go into the spending review negotiation over the come week and month and we will set out further detail in due course i look forward to be able to provide more information specifically as we go through that process 
 i call the shadow minister 
 improve public sector productivity be the no.1 ask of institute of directors business try to weather storm rachel but under labour public sector productivity have fall far behind pre pandemic level the number of civil servant work from home have go up and shockingly as the daily telegraph have find thousand of civil servant be be sign off to work from abroad therefore whether it be on civil servant work from their bedroom or from benidorm or on other blocker of public sector productivity what have the chief secretary to the treasury actually do in his last month in office or be he too comfortable with what the prime minister call 
 the tepid bath of manage decline 
 i thank the hon member for his question my no ask be that he have another go at make well joke in future to answer the substance of his question i agree with he that the state be not productive enough on a whole range of issue he talk about civil service headcount about government office and location and about work condition he could also talk about digital transformation frankly we have an enormous amount of work to do which will become evident through our spending review it be something that be be take very seriously not just by the treasury but from the prime minister downward i look forward   to his reflect on what we suggest be the answer to year of failure from his party when it be in government 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the most recent figure for government borrowing 
 in the autumn i take the decision to put our public finance back on a firm footing the most recent gdp datum show that the economy grow by in the final month of last year as i have say on many occasion our fiscal rule be non negotiable the conservative party send mortgage rate and business borrowing cost spiral we have return stability to the public finance to give family and business the stability that they need 
 the servicing cost be now twice what we be spend on defence which the chancellor be right to be increase what be her ambition for find saving in the welfare budget 
 i agree that we need to get a grip of the welfare budget which get out of control under the previous conservative government frankly i be not go to take lecture from the conservative party which crash the economy let i remind the house what the right hon gentleman say about the disastrous mini budget 
 i share entirely the free market ideology that underpin the chancellor ’s statement the chancellor be right to be radical 
 he add 
 i rejoice at the finger the chancellor have raise to socialist dogma and envy 
 i think that the financial market and the british public have unite in their view on the previous government 
 what step she have take to help increase economic growth in scotland 
 what step she have take to help increase economic growth in edinburgh north and leith constituency 
 economic growth be the no mission of this government scotland will play an important role at the autumn budget we announce that the scottish government will be provide with £ in its settlement the large in real term in the history of devolution we also confirm £ of targeted funding include for city and growth deal 
 in scotland we have see almost decade of wasteful spending while public service get bad do the minister agree that good public service be essential to economic growth and that scottish taxpayer be not get good value for money under the snp government 
 on my recent visit to scotland i hear just that the people of scotland deserve the same approach that the people of england be get from this government who have stability and economic growth as their mission and who be get a grip of public finance after year of failure quite frankly we have give the scottish government the money and they now need to get on with the job if they can not they need to move out of the way 
 i be sure that my right hon friend will agree on the importance of the scotch whisky industry support for the industry start at home by attract investment include at the port of leith distillery in my constituency which be produce single malt scotch whisky attract tourist and showcase the good of scottish hospitality my right hon friend will be aware of the industry ’s concern about the watering down of the definition of single malt which will have an impact on investment and growth will he therefore work with cabinet colleague to ensure that no change be make to the definition of single malt that would undermine the scottish success story and investment in the scottish whisky industry 
 scotch whisky be a proud british brand and export and this government will always support the industry i have check with ministers from the department for environment food and rural affairs and i can confirm that we will not be water down the definition of single malt whisky 
 mr speaker you will have see the film skyfall in which james bond and m travel up the a9 but the a9 be a killer road and we have have a litany of broken promise from the snp government that be hardly conducive to economic growth in scotland 
 i thank the hon member for his tour of the scenic a9 and for tell we the importance of that road to scotland i be sure that i support what would have be his question the scottish national party government in scotland ought to take infrastructure seriously as we be do here in the uk government 
 the minister give a very good answer to a non question 
 we can listen to the braying of labour mp from scotland or we can look at the fact that the scottish economy grow more than the uk economy in that be because of the snp scottish government ’s forensic focus on make scotland the most attractive place in the uk for foreign direct investment year after year have a progressive taxation system reward our public sector worker properly and invest in our community what difference do the minister think agricultural property relief and business property relief will have on the scottish economy positive or negative 
 of course when we make change to taxis even when that it be difficult that result in additional funding for the hon member and his colleague   to spend i be sure he be grateful that we have give a record break increase in investment to the scottish government 
 i ’m grateful for nothing 
 he may be grateful for nothing and he may be agitate in his place i suggest that he go back to the people of scotland and explain his party ’s record in government 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of the level of taxation on work people 
 the government be commit to keep taxis on work people as low as possible which be why we be not increase the basic high or additional rate of income tax employee national insurance contribution or vat the government have publish tax information and impact note for tax policy change make at the budget which give a clear explanation of the policy objective together with detail of the tax impact on individual the obr publish an economic and fiscal outlook alongside the budget which set out its assessment of the effect of government decision take on tax 
 borrowing cost be soar the economy be weaken and we need to spend much more on defence in those circumstance can people be absolutely confident that to meet her fiscal rule the chancellor will not be raise income tax in the course of this parliament 
 the obr ’s spring forecast will take place on   march   and be accompany by a statement to parliament from the chancellor ahead of the statement the government will not give a run commentary respond to forecast and economic development but i reassure the hon member that the chancellor ’s commitment indeed the whole government ’s commitment to our fiscal rule be non negotiable 
 it should not be work people who pay more tax because wealth inequality be grow in the uk and improve living standard be ultimately what the government will be judge on do the minister see the merit in introduce an annual wealth tax of on people with over £ worth of asset which would go an awful long way to raise £ per annum to equalise society 
 i hope my hon friend will welcome the £ investment in the grangemouth facility which have already be speak about today i hope he will also support the government ’s decision to restore fiscal responsibility to public finance within the tough fiscal rule that the chancellor set out at the budget

 it be right that the government have put more money into defence however in answer to a previous question the chief secretary to the treasury say that there be an impact assessment of the overseas development budget do that mean that it be still in scope of the spending review and that there could be change to that budget in june 
 just to clarify i do not say there be an impact assessment i say that the impact of the change be be consider by the government but we will set out the detail on that in due course 
 i commend the government for their international leadership at this challenging time event overnight make it even clear that europe must find considerably more resource for ukraine the chancellor have rightly continue our policy of use the interest on frozen russian state asset to benefit ukraine but i believe that now be the moment to go far by actually seize those asset russia ’s invasion of ukraine violate the principle of sovereign equality provide a basis in international law for such a policy and by act in concert with our ally we can ensure that there be no risk to financial stability may i urge the chancellor to push for co ordinated action to seize those frozen russian state asset and give that money to the ukrainians so that they can defend and rebuild their country 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his word about this government step up the funding for defence last week we expand sanction on russia include by look at financial service this week we have sign off a uk export finance package to provide more military support above and beyond our defence spending and as well as the loan repay use the profit on those asset as the prime minister say yesterday we would look at go far but as the right hon gentleman know it be incredibly complicated to do that in line with international law however we keep   all option on the table because as he be absolutely right to say russia should pay for the damage that russia have cause

 we urge all party to fully implement the ceasefire to help deliver a permanent end to hostility we be very concerned at report that israel be prevent humanitarian aid from enter gaza israel must not block aid come into gaza humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or use as a political tool we urge the government of israel to lift restriction immediately and unconditionally 
 the humanitarian situation in gaza be dire the halt on good and supply enter gaza risk breach israel ’s obligation under international humanitarian law the uk be do all we can to provide support alongside our exist support on   january the then minister for development my right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds announce a furth £ in funding to ensure that healthcare food and shelter reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure across the occupied palestinian territories and neighbouring country 
 we must all work together with the united nations and all partner to continue to facilitate aid and ensure it be sustain fully reinstate commercial delivery will be key as will allow more type of good in so that civilian who lose their home can be protect and civilian infrastructure repair 
 we welcome the announcement of an agreement to end the fighting in gaza and we welcome the release of hostage in gaza so far include british national emily damari and eli sharabi who both have both close link to the uk emily of course have meet the prime minister and discuss her dreadful treatment at the hand of hamas the hostage and their family have endure unimaginable suffering from the cruelty of hamas and the situation in gaza have continue to worsen the current ceasefire be the only way for the region to move forward 
 as we have make clear we want to see a negotiate state solution with a sovereign palestinian state include the west bank and gaza alongside a safe and secure israel we have also make it clear that we would oppose any effort to move palestinians in gaza to neighbour arab state against their will force displacement of palestinians or any reduction in the territory of the gaza strip be simply not an option we need palestinian civilian to be able to return to their home and life and to rebuild international law guarantee they this right a state solution be the only way to secure long term peace and security for palestinians and israelis 
 as the foreign secretary say 
 you can hold in your heart the pain of the israeli people and the plight of those hostage and their family and at the same time you can hold in your heart the awful damage pain and suffering that this have work on gaza with well over palestinian people have lose their life ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 we must continue to focus on the future and on turn the current ceasefire deal into a political process that lead to a state solution include the west bank and gaza 
 over the weekend the israeli government take the decision to block the entry of humanitarian aid into gaza the minister talk about that aid but it can no long be deliver israel be once again use starvation as a weapon of war and today we hear that it have also announce a so call hell plan that would see electricity and remain water supply cut off 
 these decision coincide with the end of the phase of the ceasefire agreement with negotiation on phase barely begin jeopardise the release of the remain live hostage plan for the withdrawal of israeli force from gaza and a long term peace agreement the un have say 
 international humanitarian law be clear we must be allow access to deliver vital lifesave aid 
 oxfam describe the move make as ramadan begin as a 
 reckless act of collective punishment explicitly prohibit under international humanitarian law 
 and the international court of justice have previously issue explicit instruction to israel to facilitate aid delivery to gaza 
 do the minister agree that the israeli government be again in clear violation of the ceasefire agreement and of international humanitarian law have she or have her colleague speak to their israeli counterpart to condemn israel ’s hell plan and to make it clear that there must be no resumption of the war and that   it be unacceptable for the people of gaza to be deny critical food water and medical or any other supply what action will the uk take against the israeli government if they continue illegally to use humanitarian aid and access to water and power as a bargaining chip i know that the minister want the ceasefire to hold can she share her assessment of the impact of these late development on the prospect for a last just and fair peace 
 i thank the hon lady for the urgent question a halt on good and supply enter gaza such as that announce by the government of israel do risk breach obligation under international humanitarian law to answer her question directly the uk government have be in touch with interlocutor to make that point in fact the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer be in the region push for a peace deal hence my cover this brief today although i be the indo pacific minister 
 humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or use as a political tool on   january the then minister for development my right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds announce £ in funding to ensure that healthcare food and shelter could reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure across the occupied palestinian territories the uk have announce £ of funding for the opt so far this financial year include £ for the united nations relief and works agency 
 the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns   ask about the long term ceasefire prospect the uk play its part in push both side towards a hopeful future for the region we be work with not just arab state but partner such as the us to try to push for a solution that be in line with international humanitarian law 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 i have just come back from the middle east where i go with the foreign affairs committee while the world watch with increase alarm the disintegration of the peace process in gaza we be warn in saudi arabia jordan the west bank and israel that the far right government in israel may have no long term plan on gaza but that there be a long term plan for the west bank and that be annexation the international community be well aware of that it see the eviction the demolition the increase number of israeli settlement and that people have recently be displace in these day of hard power what be plan b what will the international community do to stop the annexation of the west bank it will not be enough to simply condemn it once it have happen 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for her ongoing interest in this important matter of foreign policy and for the work that she and her committee have do include through personal interview and visit to the region that be all part of the supportive role that the uk must play it must take an international role in push for peace 
 the uk government have take a very tough position on militant faction or group attack palestinians in the occupy territory and the west bank we continue to look at the measure available to get our message across in not just word but action with my right hon friend ’s permission i will write to she as chair of the select committee with an update assessment of the situation 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 as recent day have show the ceasefire continue to be incredibly fragile of course we all want this agreement to hold and none of we should be in any doubt that that hinge on the release of each and every hostage hold by the iranian back terrorist hamas who cause the conflict by their sickening act on   october as the minister have point out those hostage and their family have now suffer unimaginably for more than day and that can not go on the hostage have be hold in barbaric condition and the world have be shock by the distressing scene involve those who have be release 
 the minister rightly refer to emily damari and other emily have share detail of her really awful ordeal in captivity by hamas we all wish she well in her medical appointment and in the treatment that she be receive last week we also tragically see the distressing return of the body of those kill in hamas captivity our heart break for their love one and we mourn with they and with the people of israel 
 i have a series of question for the minister what role be the uk play in help to get an agreement on phase of this ceasefire over the line what discussion have the foreign secretary have with america israel and other regional player in recent day what engagement have the government have with the plan for the future of gaza that be be discuss in cairo and on how to prevent hamas from continue to control the gaza strip 
 secondly what be the government ’s practical response on aid access how be they work to unblock this situation and what be happen to the british aid that be already in the region or en route finally what recent conversation have foreign office ministers have with the international committee of the red cross both on its effort on hostage release and on humanitarian assistance more broadly 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for emphasise the effect on family on both side of this terrible conflict but particularly on the british family whom the prime minister have meet and on emily damari and their dignity and grace she also mention all those who want a home want security in the region and have be affect by this most horrendous of war she evoke the terrible image of hostage be release while the most macabre of pantomime go on behind they that cruelty be utterly unacceptable and the uk have make that very clear to interlocutor both at ministerial and foreign secretary level 
 the shadow foreign secretary have talk about phase there have be stop and start in this peace process as there often be in these very difficult situation our role be to continue to speak very closely with the us and with steve witkoff to push for practical day to day solution she ask about british aid and what negotiation we be undertake we be in daily contact with the region and be push for discussion conversation and dialogue so that aid can get back in follow this urgent question we undertake to contact the red cross of our partner organisation with the message that this house want that aid to re enter the area and to save life 
 the powerful scene of palestinians celebrate the start of ramadan even as their home and life have be reduce to rubble by israeli force send a defiant message to the world that despite the displacement and destruction palestinians remain rooted in their land will the minister confirm that the decision to block all aid to gaza collectively punish the entire population be a war crime and a breach of international law contravene provision of the geneva convention and the rome statute 
 my hon friend be quite right to point out the devastating impact of no aid get through and to say that a halt on good and supply enter gaza such as that recently announce by the government of israel risk breach israel ’s obligation under international humanitarian law it be not for ministers at the dispatch box to make legal decision or judgment but i assure my hon friend that the former minister for development pledge £ to ensure that healthcare food and shelter can reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure   my hon friend must reassure her constituent that the foreign office be do all it can to get infrastructure across the opt and into gaza in order to relieve the suffering 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the israeli government be wrong to prevent humanitarian aid enter gaza that threaten the life of gazans who be dependent on aid after the destruction of the past month and be a clear breach of international humanitarian law what practical step be the government take to ensure that the israeli government back down and let that aid in i understand the depth of distress in israel about the despicable way that hamas terrorist have play psychological game with the hostage and their family but withhold essential supply of food medicine and shelter only worsen the devastation face by the palestinian people 
 in the west bank we also see illegal settler violently attack palestinians and apparently receive the support of member of the israeli cabinet do the minister agree that we in the uk must do all we can to undermine the extremist in this conflict so that a phase of the ceasefire can be negotiate all hostage can be release and gazans can receive the aid that they desperately need 
 i thank the lib dem spokesperson for his word he be quite right to emphasise the psychological impact of this terrible conflict and the traumatise state of people in the region as the foreign secretary have say we welcome the release of the hostage in gaza include of course emily damari whom we have already mention we think so much of those member of the lifshitz family they of course have strong tie to the uk who be hold hostage by terrorist in gaza and who die we thank qatar egypt and the us for provide support to ensure that the horrific ordeal of individual and family can come to an end but unfortunately this be not the end that be why it be so important that we take this moment to push 
 the hon gentleman ask what we be do practically we be in daily contact with the region include our mission there obviously in the context of the international debate intervention such as this urgent question push for a just solution for those on both side of this terrible conflict 
 last week i be in the west bank alongside other member of the foreign affairs committee on our wide trip to the middle east while the world ’s attention be rightly on the devastating humanitarian situation in gaza we meet palestinians in the jordan valley whose school be be attack whose mosque be be burn and whose livestock be be steal by extremist israeli settler this be happen with the apparent connivance of the israeli security force and it appear to be part of a wide plan for annexation what step be we take to prevent further erosion of palestinian land in the west bank that would put the state solution even far away 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his expertise on aid and foreign affair he be quite right to emphasise the action of some settler there be many settler community that just   get on with it and that want a peaceful solution but he be right to say that there be violence in the settlement which be of course unlawful under international humanitarian law and harm the prospect of a state solution i thank my hon friend for put on record the impact on the faith community particularly during the holy month of ramadan and the fact that mosque have be attack we will ensure that that point get through in our next discussion with our interlocutor both on the israeli side and on the palestinian side 
 no be surprised that as soon as the world ’s attention shift from gaza israel reimpose its siege prevent the entry of all humanitarian aid the minister know the impact that this will have on the beleaguered civilian population who be already suffer from disease starvation and an absence of healthcare after month in which israel have be give carte blanche none of we least of all netanyahu expect there to be any meaningful consequence from israel ’s action but do the minister consider what be happen in gaza to be collective punishment if she do not what would she call it 
 sometimes the word we use be really important there have be an enormous amount of suffering we know that so many in israel feel that we do not understand their need for security and so many in gaza feel that we do not understand the depth of their suffering we must redouble our effort to communicate what we want which be a state solution and a peaceful future for both community which must live side by side 
 the leader of the arab world have make welcome proposal about the future of gaza and its people what update can the minister give on the uk ’s support for those proposal and will she join i in welcome the fact that the proposal recognise that the terrorist death cult hamas can have no part in the future governance of gaza 
 my hon friend be quite right to say that as a proscribe terror organisation hamas have certainly display some very frightening characteristic that we would expect of a terrorist organisation there be also the macabre pantomime that we see in the past couple of week during the release of hostage that be truly shocking i thank he for his question the exact detail on the next stage of the negotiation be to be define by the party but we play a real role both with the ally which be israel but also work with egypt qatar and the wide region that be why our minister right now be in the region make the point that we want to be involve push for a peaceful solution and to see that day when terrorism be not extant and the community can live side by side   in peace 
 i be go to ask what we would do if the israelis refuse to let in aid or to turn on the water and power but i think we all know that basically the answer be nothing instead let i ask this the minister rightly mention the macabre display around the return of the hostage and the condition of those hostage and she be right i think she say that she have take that up with interlocutor    why have not she mention the return of the palestinian non combatant why have not she mention their condition when they be return often emaciate and show sign of torture why have she not mention the number of senior medic who have be detain without charge and then die in mysterious circumstance in israeli detention apparently there be some kind of investigation but it never come to a conclusion be she surprised that people have become cynical about british conduct in this conflict when it seem that we be only concerned about the welfare of side 
 with all due respect i think that across this house we have have a very balanced approach to the suffering of all the community in the region the right hon member be right to mention the terrible suffering of those who have experience arbitrary detention or alleged torture by various law enforcement agency he be also right to include that in what need to be the next step of the negotiation the hostage on the side but those be release from prison on the other i remind he that there be concern that some people who might have be release should not have be all of that have to be take in the round and balanced i encourage balance and understanding about the suffering of both side of the community and the desire for security in the word that we use in the house 
 the issue of collaboration and infiltration between hamas and some unrwa official be well document clearly people in gaza need aid so can the minister update we on how we be monitor the work be do to restore neutrality and confidence in unrwa 
 the uk government have be a supporter of the work of unrwa throughout this conflict and before it we have be support unrwa financially as have all international organisation and country there have be problem with certain challenge to individual who have be employ by unrwa but we have consistently join with ally in express our concern about the role of unrwa be curtail at the un security council session on   november   december   january   january   and   february and in a joint statement with partner on   october we urge that the important work of unrwa can continue 
 the blockade of aid be just the last line in a long list of activity that israelis have commit against the palestinian people now that we have cut our overseas aid to a mere of gdp the low in real term in year do the minister still agree with the labour party manifesto that international aid make the world 
 a safe more prosperous place 
 do she agree that with this move the uk ’s historic role in the middle east be dead and over 
 the hon member be right to talk about the ongoing need for aid in the region and the prime minister be very careful in his speech at the end of last week i think he have mention it since then in the press to say that humanitarian aid must continue gaza be specifically mention because it be of   our top priority the hon member be aware that the decision to divert some of our aid spending into the defence of europe be only a week old but he must also be aware that we will come forward with the detail of that i reassure he and his constituent that gaza be specifically mention in this house by the prime minister because it remain of our top priority in the foreign office 
 it be clear that israel have be embolden by trumpian tactic in impose a total siege and block all supply include humanitarian aid into gaza to force new ceasefire term we in this house should be clear and call that what it be collective punishment of the palestinian people starvation as a method of war and a blatant war crime will the minister finally sanction israel for these gross violation of international law 
 specifically on the question of sanction i think my hon friend know what i be go to say which be that we do not talk about they until we make a decision we review any tool that we have available to we to protest we also need to understand that we be in the midst of a peace process we know that peace process throughout history have have stop start element what we be do be make clear our view the view of this house and of the government that humanitarian aid must not be prevent from enter gaza while this important peace process be go on people still need to eat they still need lifesave medical treatment child still need to be educate that be the point we have continue to make all the way along 
 in her letter resign as development minister last week   the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds   write that 
 it will be impossible give the depth of the cut

 i congratulate the hon member on all the work she do in her community to show international support and solidarity for community in gaza we know that the humanitarian situation remain extremely challenging with more than have be kill and of the population have be displace many repeatedly i think the uk have a really good story to tell we have be in there for many decade now she mention the outgoing minister for development and a further £ be announce on   january   so that healthcare food and shelter could reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure the hon member ask about ongoing funding and she be right to ask that question and hold our foot to the fire once we have have time to look at the come financial year and the comprehensive spending review she will have her answer 
 do the minister agree that israel ’s decision to block aid to more than palestinians in gaza be collective punishment with of gaza ’s health infrastructure destroy medical worker kill and the world health organisation estimate that palestinians include child require urgent medical evacuation what concrete step have we take to ensure that aid get in and that those who need medical treatment have that treatment make available to they 
 i thank my hon friend for her ongoing campaigning on humanitarian aid for gaza it be very positive that the rafah crossing remain open that have lead to a significant increase in the number of medical evacuation in recent week it be vital for israel to ensure that there be a sustained passage for patient who need treatment that be not available in gaza and official from all relevant whitehall departments be explore avenue to ensure that our support well meet the need of the those who be critically ill there   the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse   talk about the medical staff who be under threat we have support they with technical advice and training and we have also announce £ for the egyptian ministry of health and population to be deliver through who egypt to support palestinians who have be medically evacuate from gaza 
 yesterday the all party parliamentary group on uk israel hear from the family of of the remain hostage it be estimate that of the who be still in captivity only be alive and have be murder the recently release hostage eli sharabi describe the condition in which he be detain he be hold in chain brutally beat and starve alon ohel who be hold alongside he remain in captivity the family believe that the remain hostage be in a very vulnerable position clearly the demand must be for all of they to be release immediately and that should be the aim of the british government what action be the minister take to ensure that happen 
 i thank the hon member for his ongoing support for peace in the region he specifically mention the family of eli sharabi and we know that those family have a uk connection the uk have play an active role in co ordinating with international partner since the beginning of the conflict the foreign secretary have visit israel and the occupied palestinian territories on occasion since take office and have work closely with european partner in push for a resolution to secure the ceasefire i think the situation have improve on that front in the last couple of week but the hon member be right to emphasise the importance of the return of hostage as part of the negotiate next part of the peace process 
 i thank the minister for update the house on this troubling matter the israeli government ’s decision be contrary to international humanitarian law and clearly undermine such a fragile ceasefire both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have be absolutely clear about the right of palestinians to return home to gaza to rebuild their life do the minister agree that their right to   return be jeopardise by the blocking of critical humanitarian aid and what action will the government take if that right continue to be restrict 
 my hon friend be right that humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or use as a political tool and we urge the government of israel to lift restriction immediately and unconditionally he ask what else this government will do we will continue to support the peace process which should involve both side get around the table free the hostage allow the aid in and have a vision for the future of this region that be so affect by conflict and death 
 i pay tribute to the former development minister my constituency neighbour   the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds for her work in this area and also for the wise word in her resignation letter 
 the minister have rightly say that force displacement be unacceptable indeed i think she say that the action of the illegal extremist settler be unlawful you may have see the oscars ceremony this week mr speaker which feature an incredible film call no other land which highlight the force displacement in masafer yatta and be make by israelis and palestinians together it win the oscar i bet they would trade every gong go for that film to have its desire effect and for the violence to stop we can do something and if ever there be a time for we to ban the illegal settlement good that fund those extremist settler be now not that time
