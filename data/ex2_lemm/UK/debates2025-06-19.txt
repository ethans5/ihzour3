the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help prevent animal disease outbreak 
 good morning can i start by acknowledge the expertise that the hon gentleman bring to the house we be invest in the animal and plant health agency and have commit more than £ to the next stage of rebuild our biosecurity facility at weybridge to enhance our ability to understand detect prevent respond to and recover from outbreak that be in addition to support farmer through the animal health and welfare pathway which include veterinary visit to improve livestock health welfare biosecurity and productivity 
 i thank the minister for his comment the recent national audit office report be hugely concern and it be clear that the uk be at high risk of and unprepared for a major animal disease outbreak post brexit check mean that only of animal be physically check as they come into the uk we know that a lot of illegal meat be come in through the port and our farm animal veterinary workforce be overstretch also climate change and antimicrobial resistance be put we at a high risk of disease outbreak if a disease such as foot and mouth hit again it will devastate british agriculture and rural community and have an impact on our food security can the minister assure we that the government be treat the issue that the report raise as a strategic national threat and that its warning will not be ignore until it be too late 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right we take this matter extremely seriously sadly it be not a new problem we have have similar report in the past and i can assure he that we be give careful consideration to this report we will develop a plan to address it he will be aware that there be a range of threat and it be important that we balance our work we have take strong measure to restrict personal import give the threat on the continent 
 as the house will know sadly the epicentre of the uk bluetongue outbreak be in my south norfolk constituency so biosecurity be a huge issue for my farmer will we look to lower our biosecurity risk by return to check product at the bastion point inland border security centre at the white cliffs business park which be close to the border point instead of product have to travel nearly mile before they be check 
 i thank my hon friend and relatively near neighbour he be right to raise the bluetongue issue which have be deal with effectively by our official his point about border control and check be under close consideration partly as a consequence of our new arrangement with the european union 
 many welsh farmer in mid wales depend on be able to move their livestock back and forth over the border with england indeed farm straddle the border the imposition of a veterinary hard border between england and wales will be damaging for the farming community in my constituency and the local economy that they support farmer simply can not afford to pay £ a beast for testing and apparently there be not even enough testing capacity for all the livestock that cross the border anyway what step be the minister take to address the situation and to prevent welsh farmer from lose out 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to ask that question as i just reference the bluetongue issue have be serious and difficult we have make a sensible decision for england and the approach we have take have manage to control the spread the decision in wales be obviously a matter for the welsh government and i be sure that he would understand that i respect that decision we be talk about how we can resolve the difficult issue that he have raise 
 i be deeply distressed that the government be plan to extend the badger cull because the evidence show that with good testing and biosecurity we can bring down rate of tuberculosis i hear what the representative from gatcombe farm say when they visit parliament just a couple of week ago will the minister look at the evidence before move forward with a badger cull will he look at biosecurity measure that could ensure that we really get on top of bovine tb 
 i can assure my hon friend that we be not extend the badger cull we have a clear commitment to end the badger cull in this parliament and i will visit gatcombe with other in the week ahead we be take an evidence base approach we also have to make sure that we help farmer tackle a distressing and difficult disease 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this month the national audit office ’s resilience to animal disease report lay bare the startling reality about our biosecurity state 
 defra and apha would struggle to manage a more severe outbreak or concurrent serious outbreak 
 and the risk of site failure at the apha site at weybridge be at its maximum rating as i have raise time in this parliament a fully fund and urgent rebuild of apha in weybridge be critical it get no mention at all by the chancellor in the spending review it merely have repeat partial funding from the department when will the government wake up get a grip and press on with this vital project as soon as possible before disaster strike 
 the hon gentleman know that i take this issue very seriously i gently point out to he that this exact situation be point out by the national audit office during the last parliament the previous government have year to get the principle in place so i will not take any lesson from the conservatives i can tell he that we have a £ investment this year that be what be ask for i can assure he that there will be fund in future because we take biosecurity very seriously 
 what step he be take to help restore chalk stream 
 chalk stream be not only a beautiful and iconic part of our precious natural landscape they be symbol of our national heritage the protection and restoration of our cherish chalk stream be a core ambition in our overall programme of reform to the water sector 
 i be grateful to the minister for her response in hampshire we be bless with several rare and irreplaceable chalk stream include the river loddon the river itchen and the river test the minister will be aware of the campaign to secure great protection for these irreplaceable habitat include during the passage of the planning and infrastructure bill and i pay tribute to the hampshire isle of wight wildlife trust greener basingstoke and natural basingstoke for all their work can the minister confirm that this government be commit to the protection of chalk stream and set out what further step they will take to restore these precious habitat 
 my hon friend be quite right chalk stream be a source of beauty and national pride just a few week ago i have the privilege of visit a chalk stream restoration project with charles rangeley wilson who be a passionate campaigner for chalk stream under this labour government water company will spend more than £ to deliver over action for chalk stream restoration and will reduce their abstraction from chalk stream by litre per day 
 the river chess in rickmansworth be of the chalk stream that go through my constituency the volunteer at the rickmansworth waterways trust be keep our canal heritage alive despite funding for the canal river trust be cut i believe the cut be short sighted because these waterway tackle water shortage boost   biodiversity and protect mile of national asset for a modest cost will the minister rethink the funding cut and back the fund britain ’s waterways campaign so that local champion like david montague and his team at batchworth lock be not leave to sink or swim on their own 
 the hon gentleman be quite right to say how important volunteer be in support our natural environment up and down the country he will be aware that the decision to reduce the funding for the canal river trust be take by the previous government and that be extend under this government there will be a tapering off of some of the funding but we continue to support water project up and down the country as i have already mention the change that we be introduce for water company will help to protect not only our beautiful chalk stream but all our river lake and sea 
 what step he be take to ensure that nature friendly farming funding scheme be accessible 
 on   june we commit to the large ever investment in nature funding for the environmental land management scheme will increase to £ per annum by and we now have more farmer than ever in nature friendly farming scheme which we should all be pleased about we be reform the sustainable farming incentive to target fund fairly and effectively and to ensure that in those scheme the user experience be absolutely prioritise 
 farmer in my constituency of frome and east somerset have have to deal with constantly change information regard the sustainable farming incentive we welcome the news that the government have allow those who start their application between january and march to submit it now but when it come to sustainable farming and nature recovery what support be in place for those who have not submit or start their application 
 the hon lady will appreciate that we inherit a scheme that do not have proper budgetary control once the money be spend none be available to people who have yet to come into the scheme we have deal with the administrative problem of those who have expect to benefit when they apply we be plan to make an announcement in the next few week in which we will explain the future scheme for people who be interested we very much want to get more people in 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 lord don curry ’s recent report on a sustainable farming model for the future be send to the secretary of state early this month have the secretary of state and the minister read it yet do they agree with i and lord curry that the uk be in a dangerously precarious position give that we produce domestically only of the food we need and that we be therefore not food secure   and need an urgent plan for food security will he meet i and the noble lord to examine this industry wide report and start the process of put britain on the path to food security 
 i think the hon gentleman know i well enough to know that when a report from lord curry arrive in my inbox i read it i do so with great interest i do not agree with the hon gentleman that we be not food secure the food security report produce at the end of last year explain this very carefully but i be always willing and happy to discuss these issue with he and lord curry 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the closure of the fruit and vegetable aid scheme on fruit and vegetable grower 
 the fruit and vegetable aid scheme be an eu legacy scheme and it close in england on   january it be available only via producer organisation that be an eu requirement and only of grower be benefit from it get no benefit all grower will continue to benefit from the farming innovation programme ’s £ of grant and the year extension to the seasonal worker visa scheme that we have announce 
 in my constituency i have busby the big strawberry and raspberry farm in leicestershire it use the fruit and vegetable aid scheme which be due to run out at the end of in order to invest and innovate the government have be in power for year they write to i in may say they have 
 plan to simplify and rationalise agriculture grant 
 but we have month to go before the scheme end and busby still do not know what its future funding will look like what be replace the scheme so that busby can carry on grow the fine strawberry and raspberry in leicestershire 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to praise our fruit grow sector it have be know for a long time that this scheme be come to an end and i be afraid the truth be that it do not provide very good value for money we will replace it as part of our new food strategy and announcement on that will be come down the line however i be slightly surprised to hear that he be so keen to preserve an eu base scheme who know that there be opposition members still hanker to be in the eu 
 if he will make it his policy to redistribute fine levy against water company since november to the water restoration fund 
 this labour government have launch the large ever crackdown against poorly behave water company as part of   this operation ofwat have hit thames water with a £ fine which be the big in british history i be delighted to confirm today that fine collect by regulator will be directly invest in project lead by community up and down the country to clean up our river lake and sea 
 i thank the minister for her answer on the water restoration fund but it would be good to know when it will come back into action a liberal democrat freedom of information request find that ofwat have fail to force water company to pay any fine for sewage discharge case since despite sewage be pump into waterway for over hour last year alone meanwhile water company boss earn a collective total of £ in the financial year the water restoration fund provide valuable fund to local community to improve water quality and river health when will the government stand up to the water company make they pay for the damage they be inflict on our environment and ringfence this money for community so that they can protect and improve their waterway 
 i thank the hon lady but with respect the response be in my original answer as i confirm the water restoration fund be continue as plan successful project have be notify and money have be announce and give as i have state all the money collect from water fine will be divert into nature project to help clean up our river lake and sea across the country and yes that money will be ringfence 
 the interim cunliffe report on the water sector have highlight weak disjointed and reactive regulation by various regulator if the commission ’s final finding confirm the assessment of the regulator can the minister confirm that she will act swiftly and decisively to reform regulation of our water company 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the important work that the commission have be do i do not want to get ahead of any announcement the commission may make it be not long to wait now mr speaker it be only a few week but clearly regulation have not be work so action be need 
 what step he be take to tackle fly tipping 
 fly tipping sky rocket under the conservative government this labour government will crack down on the waste cowboy in order to clean up britain ’s street we will support council in seize and crush their vehicle we will use drone and cctv to hunt down the fly tipper force they to clean up their mess and we will bring in new prison sentence for those transport waste illegally i be delighted to tell the house that we be begin the clean up of the disgraceful fly tipping in hoads wood site of special scientific interest which happen under the previous government that work be ongoing 
 i thank the minister for her very strong answer recently i have be make aware of a recur incident of fly tipping in bedwell in the heart of my constituency the council be work very hard to clear up the mess and find those responsible but the situation be be make bad by people pick up that rubbish and take it to the nearby wood will the minister offer extra support to council like mine so that together we can clean up our community and crack down on criminal who think that they can dump their waste with impunity wreck the life of constituent like mine and make their life a live hell 
 i have the great sympathy for my hon friend ’s constituent i encourage stevenage borough council to work with our national fly tipping prevention group which share good practice on tackle fly tipping we be also take direct action on some of the littered item because once there be litter people think that they can fly tip and then they think that they can dump that be why we have ban the sale of single use vape from   june and i stand ready to work with his council 
 when it come to crack down on litter and fly tipping i would welcome anything the government do however during proceeding on the crime and policing bill which pass through this place this week government members have ample opportunity to accept various new clause and amendment that would ensure strict tackling of litter and fly tipping but fail to do so what message do that send to those who go around tossing litter and fly tipping and importantly to the many volunteer in constituency like mine who work day in day out to clear up that litter 
 we have say that we will use exist power to create clean up squad which will force the waste criminal to clear up their mess it be a little rich of the conservative party after year of failure to attack we after just month in government we have say that we be change the carrier broker and dealer regime to tighten up arrangement relate to who can carry and transport waste because the conservatives leave we a paper base system that be open to fraud 
 what step he be take to improve young people ’s access to nature for outdoor activity 
 i thank my hon friend who be a distinguished mountaineer and mountain guide for his personal courage and bravery in climb various very tall mountain and for championing access to the outdoor the government be introduce the national youth guarantee and invest £ in bursary to help disadvantage young people to access the great outdoors we can not love what we do not know so we be delighted to be introduce the new natural history gcse in order to build on the uk ’s unrivalled history and research in this area 
 i thank the minister for acknowledge the power of the outdoor i should say that i have fail to climb many more mountain than i ever actually get up many of the lesson i learn in the mountain be the reason why i be here today the power of the outdoor in build confidence and resilience among young people be enormous i be so pleased that young people in rossendale and darwen be right now take part in the duke of edinburgh ’s award scheme that be fantastic for many discover the power of nature can be life change nationally the evidence of the benefit of outdoor recreation be extensive and unarguable yet for too many access to the outdoors remain limited and people do not live within minute of green and blue space do the secretary of state and the minister agree that a key ambition of access legislation must be access for all 
 the government be absolutely committed to extend access which be why we have commit to create new national river walk and national forest the of which be the western forest which i have the pleasure of plant a tree in a couple of month ago we be also designate wainwright ’s coast to coast walk as a national trail my hon friend be right about the duke of edinburgh ’s award scheme which my daughter will be take part in this summer we support the award which aim to reach a quarter of a more young people by next year 
 the river and coastline in my constituency be treasure by local family and child include my own whether they be kayak and paddleboarde on the cuckmere and ouse river or swim off the beach of seaford bay yet they be regularly blight by sewage discharge courtesy of southern water will the minister meet i to discuss our local campaign to secure bathing water status for the cuckmere river and blue flag status for seaford beach to reassure local family and visitor alike that we be take water quality seriously so that they can be confident that they can use these outdoor space safely 
 i would be delighted to offer up the water minister my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy to meet the hon gentleman on that issue i would just say that the king charles iii coastal path will open up a quarter of a hectare of open access land on the coast i know that lewes be very close to some of that spectacular scenery 
 what step he be take to encourage public body to prioritise the purchase of british produce 
 we have a strong ambition that half of all food purchase across the public sector should be locally produce or certify to high environmental standard the new national procurement policy statement require government contract to favour product that be certify to high environmental standard which we believe british producer operate to high standard will be well place to supply 
 both beef and crop farmer in my constituency tell i how important it be to produce high quality food and contribute to uk food security can the minister outline what conversation he have have with public body to encourage they to prioritise purchase local british produce and to maximise the social value of uk food production 
 i thank my hon friend and relatively near neighbour for her question we be in constant dialogue to achieve exactly that objective she will have notice last week ’s announcement on the extension of free school meal to everyone on universal credit which be a key plank of our food strategy it be exactly those kind of initiative that we think will benefit british producer 
 many gb base horticultural company as well as other company want to supply british produce into northern ireland but have difficulty with the bureaucracy and paperwork require by the procedure implement some year ago will the minister operate in concert with his colleague in cabinet and government to eliminate the bureaucratic problem that be prevent those company from supply uk citizen in northern ireland 
 the hon gentleman make an important point it be exactly why we want to improve our relationship with the european union we have negotiate and be undertake further negotiation to improve those system to very much help people to achieve that we genuinely believe there be real opportunity here if we can eliminate some of the unnecessary bureaucracy 
 what step he be take to tackle river pollution 
 my hon friend will be aware that we inherit record level of sewage pollution in our waterway from the previous government since the election we have launch the big crackdown on water pollution in history unfair bonus have be ban for water company executive and water boss who cover up pollution crime now face up to year in prison we will also invest a record £ of private funding to upgrade crumble sewage pipe and reduce discharge by nearly within year 
 i remain extremely grateful for the £ of support the government have give to the river wye action plan a pioneer joint effort between the uk and welsh governments but we must do more include use sustainable farming initiative to support farmer to look at their stocking rate i be concern by report of thames water seek regulatory easement can the secretary of state assure i that this government will continue to crack down on water pollution from all source in the wye the thames and all across the uk 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and i understand her concern i reassure she that the government will always act in the national interest on   these issue thames water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligation to its customer and to the environment it be only right that the company be subject to the same consequence as any other water company the company remain financially stable but we have step up our preparation and stand ready for all eventuality as i have say before include a special administration regime if that be to become necessary 
 as the secretary of state know my constituency of north herefordshire be very seriously affect by water pollution in the lugg and the wye i confess that i be disappointed that in both his answer to   the hon member for monmouthshire catherine fookes he do not mention agricultural pollution at all that be despite the fact that agriculture be the main source of water pollution in the country as be show in the report of the independent water commission which unfortunately be not allow to look into it in any detail i pay tribute to river action which this week win a court case force planning authority to consider the cumulative impact of industrial agricultural development and to greenpeace which last week point out the impact of toxic sewage sludge will he confirm whether he be update the farming rule for water give that he have cut the budget of the department for environment food and rural affairs 
 order i be sorry but we be over time as it be 
 the hon member will be aware that we be support work in the wye catchment area to deal with those problem but she be quite right in what she say the environmental land management scheme support farmer to reduce agricultural run off we be make the announcement that she just mention today and we be also support the elm scheme which help farmer to improve their soil quality so that the soil hold more water and to use less fertiliser and pesticide which reduce the amount of run off therefore we be take action on agricultural pollution and the announcement that she ask for be be make today 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 last week the minister for water and flooding and i attend the united nations ocean conference in nice we announce that the government will introduce a bill by the end of the year to ratify the high seas treaty deliver on our commitment to protect of the ocean by this agreement will provide the legal mechanism to create protect area in international water the uk reiterate our commitment to agree an ambitious plastic pollution treaty in geneva this come august and we have outline our plan to ban bottom trawl across more of our english sea in marine protect area these measure will protect sensitive seabed habitat and important specie from the destruction cause by this damaging practice 
 the beddington energy recovery facility have an outstanding request to increase its annual permit tonnage to tonne from the originally approve tonne when planning be approve i know the secretary of state be familiar with this as the facility be a mere metre from his constituency may i ask he whether the environment agency will listen to local resident include his own and to council across sutton merton croydon and kingston and refuse the permit expansion as sufficient incinerator capacity already exist in london 
 as the hon member say i do know of this situation because the facility be adjacent to my constituency as well he will know that i can not comment on what the environment agency be intend to do because it be its decision none the less i certainly agree with he that the ea must listen to constituent and people live in the local area who will be affect by this decision 
 whether it be cheap vape litter our park and town centre or fly tipping block country lane in norton canes my constituent be rightly feed up with waste crime my local council have have to deal with instance of fly tipping in the past year and it be all too often pay for by taxpayer not criminal will the minister tell we what the government be do to get tough on waste crime 
 we have announce plan to tighten up the regulation of those who transport and manage waste move they from a light touch regime into a permit system which give the environment agency a great range of power it will also introduce the possibility of up to year in prison for those who breach the new law 
 i call the shadow minister

 as i say the law officer convention prevent i from disclose whether lord hermer advise on this issue or indeed any other it do not however prevent i from say that i be surprised that the hon gentleman want to talk about illegal migration give the abject mess the conservatives leave the country in 
 counter terrorism power could optimise the effectiveness of the border security command could the solicitor general advise on how the crown prosecution service be be empower to tackle illegal migration and people smuggle 
 my hon friend raise an important point and refer to a critical part of the government ’s plan to secure our border the cps have recently receive new funding to step up surveillance and prosecution which will mean that those who commit horrible crime in relation to people smuggle feel the full force of the law 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 of our european ally have write to strasbourg request a reset of the european convention on human right to allow national parliaments to remove foreign offender who threaten public safety britain ’s signature be miss in fact we be not even ask to join unfortunately that say everything about the way in which this government be view by other can the solicitor general confirm whether the government will now back that initiative or will they leave it to other to defend the primacy of democratic lawmaking 
 as the lord chancellor make very clear yesterday the uk remain committed to the echr but it be absolutely right that as the challenge face modern democracy evolve so must international law and indeed domestic interpretation of that law this government be take a serious consider and responsible approach and we have a history of engage constructively with the court 
 accord to press report qari abdul rauf a convict ringleader of the rochdale child rape gang be still live in the town that be nearly year after a judge order his deportation repeat appeal under article of the echr the right to family life have block his removal what action be the government take to stop criminal abuse article to defeat parliament ’s clear intention to deport they 
 if you come to this country you play by our rule that be why since we come into office we have be take action to ensure that foreign offender can be deport at the early opportunity in the period since we have be in office we have deport nearly foreign criminal and fail asylum seeker that be the high rate of return for more than half a decade it be the right thing to do it will save prison capacity and it will save taxpayer money 
 if she will take step to reduce the number of prosecution bring for non violent drug relate offence 
 in its recent report the advisory council on the misuse of drugs highlight the government ’s safe street mission as a key vehicle to address the connection between drug use and criminality the government ’s flagship crime and policing bill will expand police power to conduct more drug test on more suspect upon arrest which will help to direct more drug user into treatment and away from illegal drug use 
 as drug relate death be now at record level particularly because of the increase in synthetic opioid i believe that we need to look again at supervise drug consumption facility which be an evidence base intervention that could save life and public spending both the advisory council on the misuse of drugs and the health and social care committee support the idea will the solicitor general consider facilitate a legal mechanism here as in scotland under the   lord advocate to enable local health and police authority that wish to pilot such facility to establish their efficacy to do so 
 it be absolutely right that we ensure that those who fall into drug addiction be able to access adequate support service and route to rehabilitation as my right hon friend the minister for policing say to the scottish affairs committee recently the government do not have plan to amend the law to permit the introduction of drug consumption facility we be clear however that drug death be avoidable and we be commit to support more people into recovery so that they can live healthy and long life 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 give that the independent sentencing review suggest that more use could be make of community sentence in such case but court seem reluctant to use they as an alternative to custody what can the law officer do to ensure that sentencer have confidence in community sentence which have well outcome than imprisonment in reduce reoffende 
 as my hon friend know david gauke have conduct a sentencing review that cover a wide range of these issue my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to have public confidence in community sentencing that be important 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people smuggler 
 the government be take the serious robust and tough action need to secure our border that be why we be give the police counter terror power to deal with people smuggle gang we have back that with a funding boost to the cps to enhance its capacity to prosecute case involve these appalling cross border smuggling network 
 people across lichfield burntwood and the village want the government to get a grip on people smuggling in the channel after the previous government ’s dereliction of duty too many life be at risk too many people be make that dangerous crossing although it be great news that police be work hard and have arrest dozen of people smuggler and seize almost half a pound of criminal cash it be clear that we need to go far and fast what step be the solicitor general take to ensure that people smuggler face the hefty jail term that they deserve 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be vital that police and prosecutor work together to bring people smuggler to justice and that our criminal justice system send a clear message that people smuggling will be meet with hefty jail term i be pleased to tell he that an offender who play a lead role in an organise crime group that smuggle nearly migrant be sentence to year imprisonment in may 
 do the solicitor general understand the frustration annoyance and anger of many people in the united kingdom about the fact that we be pay the french authority many million of pound to do what appear at the moment anyway to be very little to smash the gang that we keep be tell will be smash 
 international partnership be an incredibly important part of our plan to smash the gang our recent work with the french government in particular be bear a great deal of fruit in fact we hope that the french will soon be able to address the situation that they currently can not when would be migrant be in shallow water 
 what step she be take to ensure the uk meet its legal obligation under the european convention on human right 
 this government be fully commit to meet our legal obligation the rule of law be the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy not only do it underpin our legal and judicial system it provide the basis for the global success of our legal service sector 
 i thank the solicitor general for her answer in the light of the supreme court ’s judgment define sex in the equality act as strictly biological and public comment from the equality and human rights commission suggest trans individual may not be entitle to privacy protection under article what step be the solicitor general and her office take to ensure that domestic law remain fully align with the uk ’s obligation under the european convention on human right particularly article and do the government intend to clarify or consolidate domestic equality law and the echr obligation to avoid grow legal divergence 
 as to the step that the law officer be take i be afraid that i have to refer to the law officer convention with regard to the hon member ’s wide point and the supreme court ’s ruling in the for women scotland case the government have be very clear that we will continue to support single sex space while also affirm the important right that trans people have and continue to have under the equality act 
 i want to ask about our compliance with article with regard to the fast track justice system my constituent a woman with schizophrenia have be convict of not pay her tv licence during mental health difficulty spark by her mum ’s mental illness will the solicitor general meet i to discuss the single justice procedure and the way it be use in case such as that 
 i will indeed meet my hon friend to discuss that issue i believe that the ministry of justice have recently consult on the single justice procedure and i be more than happy to discuss it with he

 i would like to start by congratulate the right hon lady this be the time i have have the pleasure of respond to she at business question and they have prove to be remarkably fruitful encounter at our encounter i ask she to press the chancellor to u turn on winter fuel payment the leader of the house be clearly very influential because the u turn on that shameful attack on pensioner come just a few week later 
 at our encounter i ask the right hon lady to get the government to u turn on a national inquiry for the victim of the rape gang and this week the prime minister finally do the right thing and deliver a u turn on that as well the prime minister may be get dizzy from all his u turning but i congratulate the right hon lady on listen to the opposition use her influence and secure those u turn 
 let i turn to of the most important task of any government get people into and keep they in work on the conservative benches we know that economic growth come from the success of business   and risk take entrepreneur the labour party have never understand that and we be now see it have disastrous consequence for our country 
 unemployment reach record low under the conservative government labour government be always incredibly successful at drive unemployment higher this government seem determined to be the good ever at put more and more people out of work last week we see the devastating impact of the chancellor ’s reckless national insurance tax raid which business warn she would cost job they be right the uk unemployment rate be now at its high level since the pandemic job vacancy have collapse last month there be few employee on payroll these be the direct result of a chancellor and a government who do not understand business 
 it be about to get a whole lot bad business be clear that the employment rights bill will cost more job the uk ’s lead business group have collectively tell the government that the bill will damage economic growth and job the government be give people right in job that they simply will not have the truth be that this government be beholden to their union paymaster and can not listen to business they be a government who have take a time machine back to the employment nightmare of the 1970 when union baron give labour ministers their marching order 
 while the government and the union try to refight the battle of the 1970 the world of work be change at a rapid rate because of artificial intelligence ai bring many benefit but it be also a clear and present risk to the stability of our labour market and the livelihood of million of people in this country despite their love of regulation in all other aspect of our life this labour government have yet again delay their artificial intelligence regulation bill so ai be develop unchecked and change job in way that will have a long term impact 
 while business and worker grapple with the new reality of a century ai economy the government be determined to burden they with taxis and regulation from the last century so will the leader of the house use her considerable and prove influence to deliver a u turn on the employment rights bill before it be too late if not will she grant we a debate in government time on the impact of their union inspire tax and regulation policy on business will she bring her party back to the century and grant we a debate in government time on how we address the role of ai in the future of work 
 the story of this labour government and their economic policy be now clear if it move they tax it if it do not move they still tax it if they can find a way they send unemployment higher if business warn they that thing will get bad they do not listen if the union want something they give it to they this be a government fight the battle of the 1970 and behave like they be still student politician it be a government make the people of this country poor as each day pass 
 i know the whole house will be follow the unfold event in the middle east carefully and with a great deal of concern i assure the house that the government be work with our partner to urge de escalation and diplomacy as well as continue to engage very closely on the situation in gaza for aid to get in and for a sustainable ceasefire 
 this week be the anniversary of the murder of my and many other member dear friend jo cox this week we remember everything that jo stand for her value her passion and her commitment to build bridge and resolve conflict and to international development i send my thought and i be sure the thought of the whole house to brendan cuillin lejla jean and gordon and of course to jo ’s dear young sister my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater who i know jo would have be incredibly proud of especially in recent week

 i accept the hon lady ’s invitation to say a little bit about child exploitation but i do not accept her characterisation of there be any kind of u turn i thank she for her tone which be really important in these debate because in the midst of such unforgiveable injustice it be essential that we come together across the house to lower the temperature and to put victim and their experience at the centre as a government we have always say that we would leave no stone unturned to uncover the truth get justice for victim and lock up the perpetrator which be why the prime minister commission baroness casey ’s review in the place 
 we never rule out return to the issue of a national inquiry we have always be guide by what would be the most effective way of get the action truth justice and accountability in the most effective way possible some of those measure include implement the recommendation in the jay inquiry around mandatory reporting and the introduction of new aggravate offence for groom offender be include in the crime and policing bill that we vote on last night i be surprised to see conservative member vote against the bill which strengthen those measure so perhaps they can reflect on that next time they criticise the government 
 the hon lady raise job creation and the economy i happy to debate that subject with she she do not mention the unprecedented trade deal that we have secure the conservatives be once the party of the trade deal and free trade but they seem to have set themselves against the trade deal that be already secure job and investment since we come into government economic activity have reach a record high we have create half a new job move people into employment and real wage have grow more in the month since last july than they do in the year of the conservative government so we be happy to stand by our record on job creation and the economy 
 the hon lady talk about the employment rights bill which be absolutely not something that this government will be u turn on we be incredibly proud of give the big boost in a generation to worker in this country and it be about time too we be give they   right on sick pay abolish exploitative hour contract for the time as call for by many member for a long time and introduce fair pay agreement and many other thing in a bill that we be incredibly proud to be deliver for this country 
 finally in this week of all week parliament have find itself at the centre of the national debate a place where we should always find ourselves there be big issue at stake globally and here at home which members of parliament from all party have be grapple with and take decision on to the good of their ability whether about the conflict in the middle east the publication of the casey audit or vote on abortion and assist dying among many other issue i put on record my thank to all those across the house who have approach those issue with the respectful non partisan tone that they deserve 
 we be all elect to this place to make hard decision to represent our constituent with integrity and to work in their good interest i know that every single member of this house take that job incredibly seriously however we also have a duty not to slide into personalised over politicise clickbait attack on each other which if we be not careful undermine we all and democracy as a whole and threaten the safety of individual i be disappointed to see that member of the shadow cabinet be do just that this week and i hope they will reflect and withdraw some of the dangerous attack that they launch particularly as we remember jo cox we have a responsibility to take the heat out of the political debate—[interruption personalise political attack line exactly we have a responsibility to approach these difficult challenge with the thought respect and humility that they deserve and i think the whole house will want to do its job without fear or favour
