 integrity professionalism and accountability at every level 
 what be it about the judgment of david cameron and his relationship with lex greensill or his lobbying for chinese state interest that make the prime minister consider he a suitable candidate to be foreign secretary 
 i be delighted that the former prime minister have rejoin the government as foreign secretary he bring unrivalled experience and relationship across the world and will do a fantastic job champion british interest everywhere he go 
 tackle illegal immigration be a crucial issue for my constituent many of whom will be extremely disappointed by this morning ’s judgment from the supreme court be the prime minister able to update the house on what that decision mean for the government ’s plan to tackle illegal immigration 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i know he have champion this issue and that it matter to his constituent as i say the judgment confirm that the principle of remove asylum seeker to a safe country be lawful the government have already be work in advance on a new treaty with rwanda which we will finalise in the light of today ’s judgment to address the challenge that be raise i say again that if it become clear that our domestic legal framework or international convention be still frustrating plan at that point i be prepared to change our law and revisit those international relationship the british people expect we to do whatever it take to stop the boat and that be precisely what this government will deliver 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 the prime minister obviously think so little of his own mps that he have have to peel david cameron away from his year exile in a shepherd ’s hut and make he foreign secretary a few month ago the intelligence and security committee say that the now foreign secretary ’s role in a chinese investment fund may have be these be its word 
 engineer by the chinese state 
 i hardly need to remind the prime minister of the threat pose by the chinese communist party or the intimidation of member of this house when will he instruct the foreign secretary to give full public disclosure of his work for chinese interest 
 as i say i be delighted that the former prime minister have rejoin the government as foreign secretary as an individual with unrivalled experience he will help britain to navigate an uncertain world in challenge time of course like every other minister he will go through the normal process with the independent adviser the government ’s position on china be clear china represent an epoch define challenge that be why we have take strong and robust step to protect ourselves against the risk that it pose we will take no lesson from the labour party on protect our national security it have take almost £ from an allege chinese agent interruption 
 order those on the front bench just need to calm down 
 for someone who have spend the last few week complain about recycle bin it be ironic that the prime minister ’s late reset involve recycle the architect of year of tory failure this be the prime minister who reanimate the career of   the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman   in order to resuscitate his own just day after she be sack for a national security breach be he ashamed that he be so desperate to become tory leader and so scared to face a vote that he put someone so totally unfit for office in charge of britain ’s national security 
 the right hon and learn gentleman mention year but we should remember what happen at the beginning of those year it be this party that restore the country ’s financial security   after the labour party leave no money behind it be a bit rich to take lecture on security from a man who want to make   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   prime minister of our country 
 the right hon member for islington north be not even a labour mp any more it be a change party with strong leadership interruption 
 order we have a lot of very important business today with some important vote i want to get through this speedily 
 for year our security have be undermine by this tory government and now we have the most ridiculous pathetic spectacle of all the prime minister ’s rwanda scheme cook up with his national security threat former home secretary have blow up he be tell over and over again that this would happen that it would not work and that it be just the late tory gimmick but he bet everything on it and now he be totally expose the central pillar of his government have crumble beneath he do he want to apologise to the country for waste £ of taxpayer cash and waste his entire time in office 
 obviously the right hon and learn gentleman do not hear what i say about our approach to rwanda when it come to stop the boat rwanda be part of our plan which have already deliver a reduction in the number of small boat this year by a he talk about apologise and he talk about the right hon member for islington north not be a labour mp now yes he be not a labour mp when he decline different time to say that hamas be a terrorist organisation this week which be shameful but he be a labour mp indeed the right hon and learn gentleman serve with he he tell the country that the right hon member for islington north would make a great prime minister at that point the right hon member for islington north describe hamas as friend do he want to apologise for that now interruption 
 order be we serious hon member yes oh i would not challenge i have to say that our constituent be watch this they be very concerned about the affair of today and the vote later a lot of members wish to speak those who do not want that to happen please go outside and have a conversation there if you want to bawl and shout do it elsewhere but it will not be happen in here today 
 i be so glad that the prime minister agree that this be a change labour party while he be waste his time on this gimmick the asylum backlog have swell to people taxpayer be pay £ a day on hotel bill and people arrive by small boat last sunday alone plan a have fail after this session whether he like it or not he will have to go back to his office back to the drawing board and start from scratch can he assure the british public that he will drop what his former home secretary call his magical thinking and start treat small boat crossing with the seriousness they deserve 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about a change labour party perhaps we will see that this evening he can not even make his   party do the right thing when it come to stand by israel in the vote later today he talk about take small boat crossing seriously he have oppose every single measure that we have take let i update he on what we have do this year the number of illegal albanian arrival be down by some people have be return this year the number of crossing be down by a he mention hotel we be close of they with money be save for taxpayer all those measure by the way be oppose by the opposition what be his plan ah yes there we have it a cosy deal with the european union that would see the uk accept illegal migrant he do not want to stop the boat he want to welcome more of they 
 it be very straightforward the prime minister promise that he would stop the boat this year today be   november he have waste all his time on a gimmick and now he be absolutely nowhere will he level with the british public and finally admit that he have fail to deliver on his promise 
 this government have do more to tackle illegal migration than any in the past let we review the right hon and learn gentleman have be on the wrong side of this issue his entire career this be a man who describe all immigration law as racist he say it be a mistake to control immigration and he have never once in this place vote for strict asylum rule it be clear that while he might want to listen to the open border activist i be side with the british people 
 if the prime minister be confident about his promise he would have give an answer say that he stand by it and will deliver it by the end of the year the absence of that answer be absolutely amazing in the circumstance he have have reshuffle a forget conference speech an empty king ’s speech he even find time to fanboy elon musk but not of they have make the slight difference to the life of work people if we have a pound for every time he have a reset the cost of living crisis would have be over long ago 
 the prime minister like to think of himself as the man from silicon valley the tech savvy californian the country ’s ai pm and yet his big idea be to keep turn his government on and off at the wall and hope that we see sign of life be he start to feel that as somebody once say he be the future once 
 i slightly miss the end of that i be glad to hear the right hon and learn gentleman finally bring up the cost of living on that he be right as it be the no challenge face family up and down the country and he talk about deliver on promise but he fail to recognise that today be the day we deliver on the most important pledge i make to halve inflation we be deliver on that commitment and ease the burden for family up and down the country everything we would see from the labour party would jeopardise that progress borrow £ a year undermine our energy security and give in to his union backer with inflation bust pay rise that be not a sensible plan it would push up mortgage rate push up inflation and harm working family all the while we be go to continue deliver for the country 
 what assessment he have make of recent trend in economic growth in the west midland 
 i be sure that my hon friend will be delighted that the west midland now top regional ranking for foreign direct investment the government be invest significantly in the region include through hundred of million of pound of level up fund and town fund investment and introduce a new pilot scheme to help business in the region become more energy efficient 
 i thank my right hon friend for that encouraging answer on behalf of my constituent in lichfield may i thank he for have the gut to stop hs2 may i ask that for the area in the north of my constituency where construction be still go on that happen swiftly and that in area that will not have hs2 compensation be give swiftly to those people who be expect it

 i call the leader of the scottish national party 
 in the then prime minister and now foreign secretary david cameron say 
 people in gaza be live under constant attack and pressure in an open air prison 
 do the current prime minister not agree that if there be not an immediate ceasefire we all in this chamber will be watch on as that open air prison be turn into a graveyard 
 no can deny the suffering that the people in gaza be undergo at the moment i speak about this on monday and i speak about it consistently with mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority we be do everything we can to get aid into the region and we have repeatedly and consistently call for humanitarian pause to get aid in and get hostage and foreign national out as quickly as possible we will continue as will the foreign secretary to make sure that happen 
 how much bad do it need to get in gaza child be already dead baby in the neonatal intensive care unit be die because they do not have access to oxygen for member across the house this be a question of value and of conscience    do the prime minister not agree that should there be a vote on an immediate ceasefire member across the house should be afford a free vote 
 our position as a government be clear it be right that israel be able to defend itself that be a principle that we support it have suffer an appalling terrorist attack hamas be a terrorist organisation and it be not just israel ’s right but its duty to protect its citizen at the same time at the united nations and bilaterally with all our partner we have consistently call for humanitarian pause to ensure that more aid can get in and hostage and foreign national can get out that be the right thing to do we will continue to do everything we can to alleviate the suffering of the palestinian people i be confident that our effort be already make a big difference on the ground 
 kirklees council have close dewsbury sport centre deliver just of education health and care plan within the week target and be unable to deliver a year land supply those be just of its many failing now it want to introduce extortionate car parking charge punish hard work family and destroy the high street in our town and village do my right hon friend agree that labour run kirklees council be no long fit for purpose 
 i share my hon friend ’s disappointment with the labour run council in kirklees just this week we see a labour councillor suspend for antisemitism as he say it have also close dewsbury sport centre and be propose to increase car parking charge punish local business and shopper in the run up to christmas clearly the council be no long fit for purpose local resident deserve well 
 last week member from across the house hear testimony from a young israeli man who lose both his peace campaign parent in the   october   attack this morning we hear from palestinians who have lose generation of family in the south of gaza because of the military attack there this be a question of humanity and morality the prime minister have an opportunity to lead the call for peace or to endorse death violence and destruction which will he choose 
 i think that be an extremely naive and simplistic way of look at the problem the hon member fail to mention the fact that a proscribe terrorist organisation perpetrate an awful attack on over individual israel have every right to defend itself in those circumstance people in that country would expect nothing less than for it to provide security for its citizen of course alongside that it must abide by international law we will do everything we can as i have say to ensure that aid flow in and alleviate the suffering of the people in gaza 
 proposal for a new rail station at edginswell have be look forward to for a decade but a final funding gap exist will some of the fund release by the decision to scrap further phase of hs2 be use to resolve that 
 i can assure my hon friend that our decision on hs2 mean that every region of the country will now receive more transport investment than it would have do before include the south west i be pleased that there be fund to protect the vital rail link between exeter and plymouth that there will be a £ road resurfacing fund and that his constituent in the south west will continue to benefit from the £ bus fare until the end of next year we have previously provide almost £ to progress the station that he mention i can reassure he that the rail minister will have hear his representation and will continue to update he on the progress be make

 a significant lack of judgement 
 what do his appointment say about the prime minister ’s own judgment 
 as the hon gentleman know the government commission nigel boardman to review all those issue and strengthen the system follow those recommendation i be very confident that this nation will be well represent abroad by the former prime minister he be a prime minister with unrivalled experience of foreign affair and will help britain to navigate an uncertain world in challenge time in contrast the labour party would offer to the country a shadow foreign secretary who back the leader of the opposition ’s predecessor to be leader be pay to appear on russian television and even vote against trident do that sound like a man who should represent britain 
 the inflation number publish this morning be very welcome but the tax burden continue to bite will the prime minister agree in principle that the concept of high rate tax be never mean to drag in police sergeant band nurse teacher with additional responsibility and other and that a priority for his treasury ministers should be to return fairness to the tax threshold

 my son love football and i understand that the prime minister be a big southampton supporter after his late cabinet   reshuffle i wonder whether he can answer i this since have we see more southampton manager sack or have we see more housing ministers come and go the answer might help to explain why the government be fail so miserably on new home ownership

 it be insult that in the week that mark year since the abolition of section the prime minister have appoint a minister without portfolio who frequently attack the lgbtq+ community and who with their so call war on woke seek a return to those awful day deny our human right and attack our very existence do the prime minister agree that he have manifestly and repeatedly fail it be time for he to resign and to call a general election 
 actually this government and previous government have a proud record in championing lgbt right it be this government who introduce same sex marriage we will continue to ensure that everyone in our society can live with tolerance and compassion and have every opportunity available to they that be what we have deliver and that be what we will continue to deliver 
 last year through the homes for ukraine scheme my family and i welcome a refugee family to our home i be proud that this country have always offer refuge to those who need it however it be essential that we in this country decide who come here the prime minister have rightly say that he will do whatever it take to stop the small boat and the evil trade around they but be it not apparent   after this morning ’s ruling that what it will take be a new law to override the human rights act and cut through the thicket of case law build up by judicial activism so that we can bring back control of our border and stop the small boat 
 it be right that we go through the judgment carefully and properly as i have say the government have already be work in advance on a new treaty with rwanda to address the concern that be raise previously and be raise by the supreme court which also acknowledge that change can be deliver to address those issue let i repeat however that if it become clear that our domestic legal framework or indeed international convention be still frustrating plan after that point i be prepared to change our law and revisit those international relationship because we be absolutely committed to stop the boat 
 i thank the prime minister for meet my constituent noam it have be day since his mum ada sagi be kidnap by hamas on october we all condemn hamas ’s action and fight for the return of all hostage noam want the language of love to be loud than the language of hate some palestinians have be kill more than of they child international law be important do the prime minister agree that we can support israel but also call out breach of international law 
 i have be consistent from the start that while israel have a right to defend itself it be important that it comply with international law it be a point i have make in every meeting or phone conversation i have have with prime minister netanyahu it be a privilege to meet the hon lady ’s constituent and to hear of the pain they be go through which i have enormous sympathy for that be why we be do everything we can to bring hostage home we be engage intensively in diplomatic activity in the region and work to get foreign national and british national home and i be pleased to say that well over have now leave gaza we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that everyone can safely leave who need to 
 the prime minister know that i stand unapologetically with my steelmaker in scunthorpe he know that i believe as many across this house do that the uk must retain a virgin steelmaking capability for strategic reason if nothing else will he reassure the house that he be personally follow development at british steel and do all he can to retain what be a vital sovereign capability 
 my hon friend be a fantastic champion for her local steelworking community i hope she be reassure by the action that this government have already take to support steelmaking in our country reach a landmark agreement with tata steel to safeguard thousand of job there as well as during the pandemic   i agree that it be important for our industrial base and we will continue to have constructive conversation with all those company to ensure that we can support they in their transition to a clean green steelmaking future 
 accord to the british independent retailers association on a matter that affect every constituency across this kingdom of retailer do not even bother report physical attack on their staff and shopkeeper need to sell an additional item to make up for each item that be steal will the prime minister support the effort be make by the association and by many member across the house to ensure that retailer be protect that theft against they be call out and that they be support in every way possible and today at a meeting in dining room c will he encourage its member from those shop in their effort 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his work as vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on retail crime he be absolutely right about the importance of this issue i work in my mum ’s shop her pharmacy grow up and i understand exactly what he be talk about when small business be the victim of crime our expectation and our agreement with police force we do this early this year be that all shoplifting should be follow up where there be evidence such as cctv footage and that any violent or abusive behaviour towards shopworker particularly those who provide a valuable service to the public be never acceptable that be why we introduce a statutory aggravate factor for assault on worker who provide a service to the public i commend my hon friend for everything he be do on this issue 
 final question i call sir william cash 
 will my right hon friend give the house an assurance that he have make it clear to the new foreign secretary who of course we wish well that his policy and conduct of eu relate affair will be consistent with the government ’s election manifesto and the referendum and that he be now fully commit to uk parliamentary sovereignty self government and democracy in accordance with the government ’s subsequent legislation 
 i be delighted to give my hon friend that assurance because this government be seize the opportunity of brexit aid by his advice and support we pass the retained eu law revocation and reform act to ensure that we can regulate our growth industry more competitively and we have sign trade deal with the fast grow region across the world include most recently the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership it be this government who be deliver the benefit   of brexit to every part of our country and long may   that continue 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on the government ’s plan for end illegal immigration 
 the supreme court have today uphold the judgment of the court of appeal mean that we can not yet lawfully remove people to rwanda the important thing to note be that today ’s judgment be make on the basis of fact from month ago the government of course fully respect the supreme court but its judgment do not weaken our resolve to deter people from make these illegal dangerous and unnecessary journey 
 this be a lengthy judgment that we now need to digest and reflect upon we take our obligation to the court very seriously which be why we have already take action to address a number of point raise by the low court it be only through break the business model of illegal people trafficker that we can fully take control of our border and save life at sea this be why the prime minister back our deal with rwanda pass legislation to deliver it and say last december that other country would follow our lead we have now see that other country be indeed also explore country model to address illegal immigration include austria germany and denmark italy ’s deal with albania be a new and innovative model for process asylum claim 
 nothing in today ’s supreme court judgment dim our commitment the supreme court say there be issue with rwanda ’s asylum system that could create the possibility of someone be return to a country where they could face persecution i be strike by the court ’s remark about the risk of refoulement 
 the structural change and capacity building need to eliminate that risk may be deliver in the future but they be not show to be in place at the time when the lawfulness of the policy have to be consider in these proceeding 
 the judgment be make reference to the early proceeding 
 we have a plan to provide exactly that certainty we anticipate this judgment as a possible result and for the last few month have be work on a plan to provide the certainty that the court demand we have be work with rwanda to build capacity and to amend our agreement to make it clear that those send there can not be send to any country other than the uk our intention be to upgrade our agreement to a treaty as soon as possible which will make it absolutely clear to our court and to strasbourg that the risk lay out by the court today have be respond to will be consistent with international law and will ensure that parliament be able to scrutinise it 
 the prime minister have say that if our domestic legal framework frustrate our plan he be prepared to change our law but we be not go to put forward proposal simply to manufacture an unnecessary row for political gain we have a plan to deliver the rwanda deal—[interruption opposition member be not listen but they might want to listen to this we have a plan to deliver the rwanda deal and we will do whatever it take to stop the boat 
 illegal immigration be a huge global challenge and that challenge be grow it be a topic that i regularly raise with country across europe and around the wide world in my former role as foreign secretary across europe monthly illegal migrant number be trend upwards with an exception our number be fall illegal immigration be dangerous it undermine the law of our country and it be unfair on those who come here legally and on the british people who play by the rule it must and it will stop 
 this a wonderful country i recognise that because i have just have the chance to see it as other see it from overseas inevitably people aspire to come here but more people come here illegally be not fair on those struggle to get gp appointment housing or access to school or on those people live near to asylum hotel the impact be feel by some of the poor in our society and we have a duty to address their concern while the conservative government have take action to protect our country the labour party have vote time and again more than time not to protect our border 
 rwanda be ready and willing to help the united nations high commissioner for refugees operate its own refugee scheme in rwanda rwanda be ready to receive thousand of people process their claim give they excellent care and then support they to integrate in rwanda this be an african country full of potential and promise we have a future focus mutually beneficial partnership with it and we have a plan to deliver it 
 the rwanda plan have only ever be tool in our toolbox we have a plan to drive down number and our plan be work before the prime minister launch his point plan last december the number of people enter the uk illegally in small boat have more than quadruple but while illegal migration in the rest of europe continue to rise crossing to the uk be now down by a 
 we be tackle illegal immigration at every stage of the journey of a would be illegal migrant and our plan be work last year the prime minister sign the large ever small boat deal with france we have expand our joint intelligence cell to deepen intelligence sharing and dismantle the criminal gang cutting edge surveillance technology be in play and we have beef up security infrastructure such as more cctv at key border crossing point along the channel we have ensure that more french official and officer patrol french beach and they be work closely with uk staff so far in nearly crossing attempt have be prevent because of the close co ordination between british and french official that mean less money that the british taxpayer have to spend on hotel less profit for the criminal gang and few people to process it send a clear message to the gang and to those who want to cross that we will stop they 
 as foreign secretary i work closely with my right hon friend the immigration minister to agree a new deal with albania with well datum sharing close operational working and financial support in response to the work that he and i do the number of albanian small boat arrival have fall by 90%—i repeat that figure of 90%—so far during and we have return more than people in just month we want to ensure that it be hard to get into of those boat in the place include by reduce the supply of boat 
 we be target the movement of those good such as dinghy and engine that be use to facilitate the crossing in order to undermine a key component of the smuggler business model 
 those who do make it through will not be able to stay we have expedite return arrangement with country include france albania turkey and italy we have increase the number of illegal work raid by almost we have cut the asylum legacy backlog by more than case we have free up hundred of hotel bed with the use of alternative site we have announce the closure of the asylum hotel and we have pass the illegal migration act the most ambitious immigration legislation in decade which make clear that the only route to asylum in the uk be via of the safe and legal route we have put in place anyone who come to the uk illegally will not be able to stay they will be remove either to their home country if it be safe or to a safe country if it be not 
 mr speaker i can assure you that our commitment to end illegal immigration be unwavere we be a positive outlier in europe our effort be work small boat crossing be down our decision making be fast we be remove those with no right to be here and take action against those who be work illegally 
 we have do deal with multiple country and will continue to do so arrival down decision fast return up we be get on with the job and will do whatever it take to deliver on our commitment to stop the boat i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i welcome the new home secretary to his post he be the conservative home secretary in year and what a mess he have inherit the supreme court ’s conclusion today be damn it expose the complete failure of the prime minister ’s flagship rwanda policy of his judgment in make it the central part of his policy and of the conservatives in get the most basic grip on the boat and asylum chaos 
 there be no serious plan on the dangerous boat crossing that be undermine our border security and put life at risk the end of which we all want to see there be no serious plan to sort out the chaos in the asylum system include end place people in costly asylum hotel because of the soar backlog there be a readiness to spend more than £ of taxpayer money on this plan money we can not get back now that the policy have totally fail that add to the prime minister ’s disastrous judgment in appoint and back the previous home secretary who be unfit for the job 
 i do not agree with pretty much anything the home secretary ’s predecessor ever say but she be right in this message to the prime minister 
 if we lose in the supreme court you will have waste a year and an act of parliament only to arrive back at square your magical thinking have mean you have fail to prepare any sort of credible plan b 
 wasting time waste money and let the country down that be the conservative record 
 the supreme court judgment outline a catalogue of problem with the policy but ministers know all about they when it be announce month ago i raise in the house the problem with the israel rwanda deal minister be warn many time about failure and weakness in the rwanda asylum system but they just press on even if the plan have be find lawful today they have admit it would have cover only a few people anyway at a time when people apply for asylum in the uk last year on the conservative watch and that it would have cost about twice as much per person as decide case in the uk 
 the truth be the government have waste not just but year by fail to deal with the situation year ago there be just a few people cross in boat but they let criminal gang take hold along the channel they let asylum decision collapse so the backlog soar and there be now more people in asylum hotel than there be when the prime minister promise to end that 
 will the home secretary tell we how much in total the government have spend on the fail rwanda plan so far the house have a right to know he say he want a new treaty how much more will that cost despite his optimism the supreme court judgment say 
 the rwandan government indicate that the contemplated arrangement might not be straightforward to implement in practice the provision of resource do not mean that the problem which we have describe can be resolve in the short term 
 again we have more of the magical thinking 
 what do this mean for the prime minister ’s flagship legislation he boast about pass it only yesterday but the government have not actually commence the central clause of the law because without rwanda and frankly even with rwanda the policy do not work and will just lead to an endless ever increase permanent backlog will the secretary of state confirm now that he will not be implement the central tenet of that law this year will he also confirm that this mean that the prime minister ’s pledge to introduce the new law to stop the boat and end hotel use will all be break this year 
 why will the home secretary not put that money into a proper plan to tackle the boat i do not believe that he ever believe in the rwanda plan he distance himself from it and his predecessor ’s language on it he may even on occasion have privately call it batshit but he and i agree that we need action to stop the boat crossing that be undermine border security and put life at risk we need a properly control and manage system for asylum and refugee 
 let we concentrate instead on the thing that can work we support the work with france along the northern coast we want it to go far we support the work with albania and with other country across europe to tackle the gang but it be far far too weak we need a proper comprehensive and massively scale up plan to go after the criminal gang a proper system to clear the backlog and a proper return unit in place so that we can end hotel use instead of that cost go up from £ to £ a day on his watch let we end hotel use and save the taxpayer £ that should be common ground so i suggest that he stop waste taxpayer money on more fail scheme that   he ditch the magical thinking and the culture war of his predecessor and that he ditch the gimmick and finally get a grip 
 of the danger of write a critique of government policy before read the fact lay out in a statement be that the statement make the critique obsolete the right hon lady talk about hotel usage which i remind the house be come down she talk about small boat arrival in the uk which i remind the house be come down she talk about form close working relationship with our european partner which i remind the house we be already do 
 in response to the right hon lady ’s various question i have write here do labour have a plan interruption if those on the labour benches could curb their enthusiasm and listen to what i be about to say next they would hear that i be go to concede that it be clear that they do have a plan their plan their great idea be to do what the government be already do which be buck the european trend when other country be see or increase in their illegal arrival we be see a reduction of in ours buck the trend 
 we have always say that rwanda and the deterrent effect of the rwanda plan be an important tool in our toolbox we have never claim that it be the only we have always pursue a range of option when i say we i mean my right hon friend the immigration minister with i watch he from king charles street although the collective we be appropriate here and as i set out in my statement those activity be have an effect 
 my final point be that the mask have slip the glee that i detect from those on the opposition benches for this temporary setback on the delivery of our plan display what we on the government benches know to be true they do not want migration control to work they do not want to take control of our border they would rather delegate it to anybody else—[interruption 
 order i want to hear the home secretary i do not need those on the front bench—[interruption you may pull face but the bottom line be that i want some quiet to hear what be be say our constituent at home want to hear that as well but when you be chuntere so loudly they can not do so 
 indeed mr speaker 
 may i welcome my right hon friend to his new position the home office be a great department of state and i hope that he enjoy his time there as much as i enjoy my time as home secretary will he confirm that the judgment that the supreme court make today be not contingent on the european convention on human right indeed the fundamental judgment be make regardless of the echr 
 i pay tribute to my right hon friend and predecessor she be a fantastic and long serve home secretary and i intend to compete with she on both of those metric she make an incredibly important point we look closely at the judgment and find that it draw our attention to work that we can do work with our partner in rwanda to address the   supreme court ’s concern about people be return to unsafe country that be where we will address our focus because that will be the pathway to ensure that rwanda remain a key element of our basket of response to illegal migration 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 we on the snp benches be very glad to see the unanimous decision of the supreme court today it really be quite ridiculous for the new home secretary to come to the house today to tell we that his predecessor ’s dream will never die it have go give it up do something else instead before the extremist on his own benches start to blame the echr the supreme court judge lord reed be very clear that this be not just about the echr but about the refugee convention the un convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the international covenant on civil and political right as well as our own domestic legislation 
 the supreme court make it clear that rwanda be not a safe country at the heart of the judgment today be the principle of non refoulement which mean that people must not be send back into harm ’s way the united nations high commissioner for refugees provide compelling evidence of rwanda do so even after it sign the memorandum of understanding with the uk as well as in its early deal with israel the unhcr point out that it have reject claim from country such as syria yemen and afghanistan it be absolutely ludicrous that those claim could be reject it also point to the lack of integrity in rwanda ’s own system it be a serious problem and that the home secretary claim today that he want to fix but he should focus his intention instead on fix the multiple failing of his own department 
 what now for the illegal migration act and for the people who will now be leave in immigration limbo without any recourse to claim asylum this incompetent tory government can not yeet they back to rwanda and they will not process their claim so what will happen to that group of people the solution lie not in puncture the market in rubber dinghy but in create function safe and legal route in the half of the year the large group in small boat be afghans that be proof positive that the scheme that the government claim exist be just not work 
 many people make these dangerous journey because they have no other option that remain the reality whoever the home secretary be so i ask the right hon gentleman when he will stop waste public money chase fantasy at least £ have be spend just on the legal challenge never mind the rest of this incompetent scheme when will he create a system that treat the most vulnerable in the world with the dignity and respect that they be due to rebuild their life here in the uk 
 the immigration minister have not even give glasgow ’s mps the meeting that he promise to discuss the people that the government be about to make homeless through their bulk processing if the home secretary will not take seriously his responsibility on immigration and on refugee will he at least allow scotland to have the right to do so because we want to welcome people to our world 
 on the hon lady ’s final point if scotland or rather the scottish government not the scottish people want to be more generous in practical term to people seek refuge here they can do so in my experience they choose not to 
 with regard to the work that we be do i make clear in my statement the various work strand that we be do in close co operation with country around the world to address all element of the illegal migration pipeline include interrupt the logistic around this evil practice and it be work i draw the hon lady ’s attention to the fact that many other country around europe country that we have close working relationship with be see a significant increase in their illegal arrival in stark contrast to the reduction we be see in the uk 
 the hon lady talk about a number of thing but ultimately i be draw to the remark that the court make about refoulement 
 the structural change and capacity building need to eliminate that risk may be deliver in the future 
 that be exactly what we be seek to address 
 i welcome my right hon friend and essex neighbour to the great position of home secretary and wish he well in all his endeavour on this incredibly difficult issue he touch on the supreme court ’s decision and its comment on refoulement today ’s judgment be clear on that but the issue be not new it be raise early this year in the court of appeal if i may say so ministers have the opportunity to address some of the practical measure prior to today ’s judgment i urge the home secretary to take every necessary step and measure to work with the government of rwanda on the practical operational delivery of the migration and economic development partnership to give all those assurance that partnership be clearly integral to ensure that we break the business model and stop the evil trade of people smuggle address that principle will go a long way towards bring in this essential deterrent in the illegal migration battle 
 my long stand friend and predecessor be absolutely right we will break the people smuggle gang we will undermine their business model we will pursue all the various workstream that my right hon friend will be familiar with from her time in this fantastic office in parallel just as she suggest we will work indeed we be already work to address the issue raise by judge in the low court to ensure that we can prove what they need to see which be that we will remove the risk of refoulement 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 i congratulate the right hon gentleman on his new role this morning at the home affairs committee david neal the independent chief inspector of border and immigration tell we that the big challenge face the home office be be professional maintain objectivity be fair and understand human right the inspector also say that what keep he up at night be the question of who be protect our border and whether they be do so to the good of our collective   ability could the home secretary tell we whether today ’s ruling on rwanda prove or disprove mr neal ’s concern 
 the government be responsible for the protection of this country and it be a role and responsibility that we take incredibly seriously it be the primary function of government in this statement and in the other statement i intend to make and which ministers from the department will make from the dispatch box we will show the house and the country that conservative members take that responsibility incredibly seriously and we will take whatever action be necessary to ensure the protection of the people and the border of this country it would be helpful frankly if the labour party would break the habit seemingly of a lifetime and once in a while vote to support the action that we take 
 as well as welcome my right hon friend most warmly to this post a post in which his and my former london assembly constituent in bexley and bromley be massively proud to see he i congratulate he on the tone and manner of his statement it be right that as a rule of law abide country we respect the decision of the court however they go the supreme court be ask a legal question and it give a legal answer do he agree that it be clear that the decision be essentially fact specific apply to well establish legal principle and the solution be to look at how those fact can be rectify to make this compliant 
 my long stand friend and former south east london representative be absolutely right their lordship tell we what we need to do to address their concern we intend to do what they say need to be do we will address their concern operationalise this plan break the business model and stop the boat 
 per cent of those claim asylum in this country be lgbtqi+ people flee country where just be themselves can be a death sentence do the home secretary agree with his predecessor that they be pretend 
 if the right hon gentleman want to know my view on thing he can ask i for my view on thing rather than ask i to comment on other people ’s view 
 i welcome the new home secretary to his place and share his disappointment at this morning ’s judgment as we have hear the supreme court focus on the principle of non refoulement hopefully that can be address in a new treaty perhaps it will be make more robust if we can work jointly with other european partner who have express an interest in a rwanda type scheme why however be this not consider in the original rwanda treaty and which law officer be responsible for give legal advice to the home office about how it might stand up to challenge in the court 
 my hon friend know that government legal advice be for inform the decision making of minister it be not appropriate to discuss government legal advice at the dispatch box and we will not do so he know that we always prepare for a range of   eventuality as i say in my statement we recognise that this be of the decision that might come from the court we listen carefully to the statement make by the judge in the low court and we have already start to take action in response to the concern that they have raise 
 i too welcome the new home secretary to the dispatch box he have a difficult job but it be in everyone ’s interest that it be do well i also welcome the part of his statement in which he say we be not go to put forward proposal simply to manufacture an unnecessary row for short term political gain that much at least will be a refreshing change but he should be aware that his hon friend   the member for ashfield lee anderson the deputy chairman of the conservative party be report as have tell itv that the prime minister should ignore the law follow the supreme court ’s decision will the home secretary dissociate himself from those comment 
 this country pride itself on be a law abide country so to hear the government ’s position on thing listen to the statement of government ministers i have make it clear that we respect the judgment we listen carefully to the comment make by their lordship and the low court as i say we be already respond to the comment that they make to ensure that the action we take when the rwanda scheme be operationalise be in strict accordance with international law 
 will the home secretary explain to those of we who be not expert in this area why it be that people who arrive illegally on our shore from a safe nearby country can not immediately be return to that safe nearby country clearly it would be in breach of certain law so can he set out perhaps in a statement what those law might be 
 receiving country have to consent that be the nub of the issue that be why it be so important that ministers in the department particularly the immigration minister have spend so much time work with those country from which we have traditionally receive illegal migration include france and other most notably in term of the statistic albania with which we have develop an excellent work relationship i will claim a bit of credit here because my right hon friend the immigration minister and i form something of a tag team with the government in tirana and we be see the success that come from pragmatic but determined relationship with european partner and other i pay tribute to the immigration minister for that work 
 i also warmly welcome the home secretary to his post not least because i know people in the foreign office who be rather sad to see he go however let i try this question again what do he think about the of people who claim asylum on the basis of their sexuality because they face massive persecution and death threat in their own country do he think they be pretend to be lesbian gay or bisexual if he do can he provide evidence for that 
 the hon gentleman will know that we can not prove a negative that be a fallacy i thank he for his kind word about my time as foreign secretary he will know since he clearly have a mole inside my old organisation how passionately i pursue the right of lgbt people around the world include have some very difficult conversation where necessary i absolutely want to make sure that those people be protect but we should also recognise that bad people hide among good people and sometimes people lie to take advantage of the good will of other 
 it be nonsense to suggest that everybody who claim to be suffer persecution because of their sexuality be lie and i would certainly never say that but we need to ensure that people be not attempt to abuse the process as we do with any process or system because that limit our ability to help those who genuinely be in need i recognise that lgbt people do face genuine persecution around the world and we want to support and help they 
 much of the supreme court ’s judgment today be encouraging with a high court endorse yet again the principle of what we be look to do with rwanda as be touch on early much of the decision turn on the fact particularly those relate to refoulement that is the risk that those transfer to rwanda might be return to a country where they would face persecution may i test my right hon friend on what work he be do look at the decision make capability of the home office to help rwanda to build up its own decision make capability and how our judiciary might work with rwanda ’s judiciary to address some of the supreme court ’s point in that area 
 i pay tribute to my right hon friend—[interruption i mean to say my hon friend although he deserve to be my right hon friend i know that he do a lot of the work on this very subject and his question go to the heart of how we operationalise the rwanda plan their lordship set out exactly the point he raise about capacity building and professionalise rwanda ’s system i have have exchange this morning with my rwandan opposite number who i have meet before the rwandans be keen to build and strengthen their institutional structure and they see we as a key partner in achieve that together we will work to operationalise this plan i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work he do on this very issue 
 the supreme court ’s judgment have put pay to the lazy ill inform argument that it be the european convention on human right and only the european convention on human right that be block this government on asylum and immigration this government have spend year formulate a policy that have prove incompatible with a multitude of international treaty to which the uk be sign up and with numerous provision of our domestic law the supreme court be very clear about that my question for the home secretary be this when be he go to explain to his back benchers that the uk government ’s response to this judgment must be to produce a humane asylum policy that work not to try to overcome vital check and balance of the rule of law and human right law that stymie bad policy decision and protect human right 
 our immigration policy as lay out in the figure i run through in my statement be have the positive effect that we commit to we be bring down small boat number the need for hotel place and so on i say in my statement that their lordship have set out the route to successfully operationalise the rwanda scheme through address those concern about refoulement we will focus on what we need to achieve to unlock that we recognise that this be a constant battle against criminal and as with all constant battle against criminal we focus on what be effective and right their lordship set out exactly what that be and that be what we will focus on 
 i genuinely welcome my right hon friend to his place at the dispatch box speak softly and carry a big stick be always a very good way of behave no reference intend i fully agree with all his intention and the direction of travel in which he want to go to settle this issue in term of proper organisation such that concern be deal with in the court do he not agree that those who greet this judgment with glee need to remember that people be die in the channel try to cross in the boat 
 will the home secretary ask our right hon and learn friend the attorney general to come to the dispatch box in due course to reflect on the judgment it appear to i that it be much wide than the migration judgment because we be now link directly to applicability in uk law agreement that be make with the un that be never bind into uk law whether want it or not that widen the whole issue of what become justiciable and i would be grateful if she would come to the house at some point and deal with that 
 i thank my right hon friend for his kind word my focus in this role be make sure that the department be highly effective in protect the british people and protect our border this be not about try to look tough it be about try to deliver for the british people and that will be my relentless focus my right hon and learn friend the attorney general remind i that her advice like that of all very good in house lawyer be limit to the client which be his majesty ’s government however i have no doubt i could persuade she to meet my right hon friend on a private basis 
 i welcome the home secretary to his new role i be sure he would want to join i in express gratitude to all those in our public service who come here as refugee and make such a fantastic contribution to our country at the heart of this case be a series of asylum seeker of whom i know have be confirm as a victim of trafficking he have be stick in an asylum hotel since may as yet the government have not even begin to look at his claim for asylum can the home secretary tell we when his department will begin to process the claim of those people and get on with find out whether they be illegal asylum seeker or be he just go to continue with the charade that he can make rwanda workable 
 i do not have the detail of the individual case that the hon lady raise so i can not comment on the specific but i remind she and the   house that as part of the prime minister ’s point plan eliminate that historic backlog of case file be a commitment at the start of this process the backlog stand at case it have now be reduce to 
 few than 
 few than so we be deliver on our commitment to work through that backlog of case it be of the area where we make a commitment we be deliver on it and we will pursue all the element of our plan 
 rise 
 order i urge colleague to be brief in their question so that the home secretary can be brief in return we have a very pack agenda today and i want to make every effort to get everyone in 
 i add my congratulation to the home secretary on his new role it seem to i that the key word be time we can not keep relitigate this question to achieve what seem an ever move target in what the court want we to achieve our constituent send we here with a very clear message sort the small boat issue parliament have pass legislation to sort the issue can my right hon friend be specific about the point at which the attempt by the government to recondition the agreement with rwanda into treaty form will have elapse and a notwithstanding clause of the kind that my hon friend   the member for harborough neil o’brien   have set out will become the only tool by which we can ensure that the will of this house take effect we can not allow this cycle to continue indefinitely 
 order i remind the house that i do just say be brief 
 i listen carefully to my right hon friend ’s comment we be absolutely determined to maintain the deterrent effect of the rwanda scheme to an extent it be already demonstrate utility by the fact that we know anecdotally so i will not over interpret these figure that the fear of it as part of our arsenal be already have a deterrent effect which be exactly what it be design to do national governments can not just vote themselves out of international commitment i recognise as a former foreign secretary that they be incredibly powerful tool as we try to do good around the wide world i give my right hon friend the commitment that we remain relentlessly focused on ensure that we continue to drive down the small boat crossing use the full range of capability at our disposal 
 the home secretary and the government be right to prioritise end illegal migration by my count he speak time in his statement about have a plan the only word he leave out be cunning because his plan seem to be as workable effective and chaotic as baldrick ’s in blackadder that be no laugh matter because while the plan be not work there be still pressure on our infrastructure there be still criminal gang profit   from people ’s misery and people who use legal route be be disadvantage will the home secretary give we the commitment that if the european court of human rights continue to be a barrier to the will of this house the government will take action and ignore the demand of that court 
 the right hon gentleman know that i have a huge amount of respect for he point that i take from the judgment today be that it be not just about the echr their lordship set out a number of international commitment that we have make but they also set out what we need to do to get the rwanda plan up and run that be on a very specific legal point which we be already in the process of address 
 i respectfully disagree with the right hon gentleman because small boat arrival be down unlike almost everywhere else in europe where they be significantly up the use of hotel bed space be down because of the arrangement that we have put in place the speed of processing have increase and the volume of processing of asylum claim have significantly increase there be always multiple strand to this plan as set out in the point that my right hon friend the prime minister put forward and they be have the desire effect we will just keep work to deliver on our commitment 
 do my right hon friend agree that of the glory of our parliamentary democracy be that government have to obey the law in the same way that individual citizen and corporation do do he also agree that those who look carefully at the judgment and think that there be a simple solution with lever to pull will be disappoint
