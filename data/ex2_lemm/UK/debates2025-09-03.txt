 i thank the hon gentleman for that question and for all his work to amplify the voice of victim and survivor like he i be sicken by the treatment of the majority of woman and girl who go through this in our criminal justice system he will know that we inherit a criminal justice system in absolute crisis that be why we conduct a once in a generation review of our court process the leveson review which the government will respond to shortly and a once in a generation sentencing review to consider exactly the issue that he be talk about i will happily meet he to discuss this far 
 my constituent who have be the victim of historical domestic abuse by both her partner and her child recently raise with i the need for a clear understanding and definition of child to parent abuse at the time of her abuse she do not know that what her child be do could be classify as domestic abuse and both the police and social service fail to understand that she be the victim not her child will the minister provide an update on the work to reach a legal definition of child to parent abuse

 i recognise the importance of gender recognition certificate let i be absolutely clear to this house as i have be on many occasion no include trans people should suffer indignity or a lack of respect they must of course have access to safe provision and appropriate service however the supreme court ruling be clear that biological sex be the mean by which single sex provision will be deliver 
 i be really pleased that the government be commit to deliver a full trans inclusive ban on conversion therapy when will that legislation be introduce to bring that abusive practice to an end

 the result of the previous government ’s call for input show that although the law be be follow in the majority of case a small number of example be identify that seem to have misinterpret how the single sex exemption of the equality act operate as the hon lady will appreciate it be for the independent regulator the equality and human rights commission to follow up on these issue through the appropriate process it be do so in more detail and will work with organisation to put that right

 it be in the interest of the whole of society for tran people to be able to leave the house and for there to be a loo that they can use in peace when they do so while they contribute fully to our society do the secretary of state agree that when the final guidance be publish which we expect soon parliamentary scrutiny would be a good thing to ensure that the guidance be as good as it can possibly be so that trans people can live their life to the full with the clarity and security that they need 
 i agree that trans people and woman deserve appropriate access to safe space and the right level of accommodation and that we must ensure that provision be there so that no feel that their safety be at risk to be clear to the house the government do not receive advance sight or notice of the interim update from the ehrc the ehrc have now consult on its propose change to the draft update code follow the ruling i have yet to receive that code from the ehrc once that happen we will ensure that as a government we consider it fully as the house would expect

 i be sure that the whole house have sympathy for the case that the hon gentleman have outline i understand that the inquest be ongoing but to answer the substantive point of his question child ’s and adult social care have historically not always be what victim feel they could rely on with many case to demonstrate that over the year without doubt as i sit next to the secretary of state for education the work with my office with the ministry of justice and with her office to ensure that that be handle in the violence against woman and girl strategy and more broadly be at the top of the agenda for all of we 
 will my hon friend use this opportunity to remind the house how many woman and girl be vulnerable to people they know as distinct from people they do not know will she also use this opportunity to condemn elect politician who peddle misinformation about who be most at risk and where the target really be 
 i do not have in front of i the exact datum that my hon friend have request i be not entirely sure that exact datum exist but what i can say base on decade of experience be that woman and girl in our country be far more at risk from people who know our name and whose name we know and who we work among and live alongside the idea of stranger danger be that most woman do not recognise the people they fear be people they know 
 the parole board be extremely concerned about the impact on domestic abuse victim of the sentencing bill that be now before the house i urge she to keep in close discussion with member of the parole board and with the justice secretary as the bill progress

 do the minister agree that listen to the voice of bereaved family who have lose their baby be of essential importance if he do will he listen to the call of sussex family to appoint donna ockenden to lead their review 
 i agree that it be vital to listen to those voice it will not be possible to get to the bottom of why care be not of an acceptable standard without hear those voice i have hear what the hon lady have say about donna ockenden and i will certainly take that away to discuss with ministerial colleague

 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i know the whole house will want to send our condolence to the family of our former colleague david warburton 
 i also welcome the fact that the deputy prime minister have refer herself to the ethic adviser she have admit that she underpaid tax so why be she still in office there be not just a crisis at the very top of the prime minister ’s cabinet there be a crisis brewing for the whole country when be the last time that the cost of government borrowing be so high 
 i join the leader of the opposition in her comment about mr warburton i think the whole house would unite on such an issue 
 in relation to the deputy prime minister she have explain her personal circumstance in detail she have go over and above in set out the detail include yesterday afternoon ask a court to lift a confidentiality order in relation to her own son i know from speak at length to the deputy prime minister just how difficult that decision be for she and her family but she do it to ensure that all information be in the public domain she have now refer herself to the independent adviser that be the right thing to do but i can be clear that i be very proud to sit alongside a deputy prime minister who be build home who be bring forward the big upgrade to worker right in a generation and who have come from a working class background to be deputy prime minister of this country 
 on the question of borrowing cost they have rise across the world as the leader of the opposition well know we be drive they down by get debt down that be hardwire into our fiscal rule those fiscal rule be non negotiable i be not go to take lecture on the economy from the conservatives who crash the economy mortgage go through the roof and there be a record fall in living standard 
 i be not sure we would have hear all that sympathy if it have be a conservative deputy prime minister who be be attack i remember when the prime minister say that tax evasion be a criminal offence and 
 should be treat as all other fraud 
 if he have a backbone he would sack she 
 but let we get back to the issue of borrowing the prime minister do not answer the question about why it be so high the conservatives leave he the fast grow economy in the g7 under he the cost of our borrowing be now high than it be in greece why do the prime minister think that be 
 if it have be the conservatives there would not have be the accountability which be now in place because they spend year and year avoid it the right hon lady ’s claim about the economy on   their watch be about as credible as her place at stanford university interruption she leave out of her account because she want to talk down the country that we have the high growth in the g7 i look forward to she get up and welcome that we have have interest rate cut in a row and of course £ of investment in the year of a labour government that be a record 
 it be a terrible record i stand by every single thing that i have say the prime minister can not say why borrowing be high under he i will tell he why it be high it be because the chancellor change the fiscal rule so that she could borrow record amount she maxe out the country ’s credit card and that have push up borrowing cost these be their bad choice former member of the monetary policy committee be warn that 
 we be head for an economic crash 
 why do the prime minister think that he be right and they be wrong 
 the right hon lady can not resist it she come straight back to talk the country down at every opportunity she do not welcome the high growth in the g7 she could have get up and welcome that but no what about the job that we have create she could welcome that but no what about the trade deal that we have not only do she not welcome they she oppose they and of course she have not welcome the norway deal the big deal for shipbuilde in a very very long time she should stop talk down the country and get behind the renewal that this government be deliver 
 the prime minister be drag down the country he be drag it down how can he stand there and say that he be create job unemployment have go up in every single month under this labour government he do not know why borrowing cost be go up another reason be that the market can see that he be too weak to control spending now we be read that he want to have another go at welfare costing what make he think that labour members will vote for it this time 
 i think i see that the leader of the opposition say this to the sunday times at the weekend 
 i have inherit a gigantic mess and i ’m clean it up 
 she say 
 it ’ very difficult it ’ go to take a while 
 i know exactly how she feel 
 more 
 we be not the one refer ourselves to ethic adviser the fact be that he be flounder he—[interruption perhaps he should have a read—[interruption 
 order 
 perhaps he should have a read of the—[interruption 
 order we do not want to start the session with someone leave do we if someone want to volunteer please do so if not i will choose 
 labour members can do the fake cheer as much as they like the whole country know what a mess of the economy they be make 
 it be clear that taxis be go up for everyone except perhaps the deputy prime minister i warn before the summer that we would face week of speculation about which taxis would be go up the former head of the institute for fiscal studies have say 
 this sort of uncertainty be actively damaging to the economy 
 and now we find that we have to wait until   november   for a budget do the prime minister really think that the country or the market can wait that long 
 the right hon lady say that the opposition be not refer themselves to the ethic adviser that be among the reason they get boot out of office last year she complain that we be go through the due process for a budget and go through the necessary step we try a budget on their watch without go through those step what happen they blow up the economy we will take no lesson from they 
 this be desperate stuff from the prime minister this week he have another reset this morning the prime minister scrap his mission after scrap his foundation his step for change and his pillar for growth the truth be that this man have get no clue clue but this be serious the prime minister ’s incompetence be hurt real people they be lose their job and the cost of everything be go up from energy bill to the weekly shop this be a crisis make in downing street be it not the truth that he be too weak to change course and too arrogant to admit he get thing wrong 
 i do not know what social media site the right hon lady have be on this morning but i think the chair of the tory party say that this government be the firefighter well in a sense we be because we be put out the fire that the conservatives create they be the arsonist the big fall in living standard on record blow up the finance we have spend the year put out their fire quite right too but now we be deliver on the cost of living fund childcare worth £ for working family free breakfast club and open new school base nursery that be what we be fight for the good start for every child in this country 
 the mayor of the west midlands richard parker be deliver growth and job by back sme such as booghe toys in my constituency which have just double in size will the prime minister join i in praise this success and confirm that boost ambitious small and medium sized business across the uk remain a key priority of his government 
 may i recognise and congratulate the business in my hon friend ’s constituency we have publish our small business plan which be very   well receive it include new rule crack down on late payment which have long be ask for a £ boost to more business loan and fair business rate system to support small business that be why it be so warmly receive

 we have all see the horrifying image from gaza the baby so thin from starvation that you can see their skeleton the body of child kill while queue for water the emaciated hostage still hold captive by hamas the prime minister have rightly say he want to stop all that so when the man in the world who have the power to stop that come to our country on a state visit will the prime minister look president trump in the eye and urge he to use his influence on netanyahu and qatar to make it stop 
 may i join the right hon gentleman in his comment about annette brooke and also in his description of the horrifying situation in gaza it be horrify we be look at a man make famine on top of everything else that be why we be expend so much of our time with partner on seek to bring about a ceasefire to get humanitarian aid in at pace to get the hostage out and of course to put forward a peace plan that can actually take we to a stage solution of course i will talk to all international leader about that i gently say to he that if he have not refuse the invite to the state banquet he could have be there week on tuesday speak to president trump himself i be surprised it be not an act of leadership to pass up that opportunity 
 i have to disagree with the prime minister on that we be now debate this issue 
 here be an issue on which i hope the prime minister will agree with i the european convention on human right be a british creation that protect all our basic right and freedom the right of child disabled people survivor of domestic abuse victim of horrific crime everyone it protect care home resident from abuse and family from be spy on by council but the leader of the conservative party and the leader of reform want to join russia and vladimir putin by withdraw from the convention the liberal democrats disagree and so do the majority of the british people will the prime minister categorially rule out withdraw from the echr suspend it or water down our right in any way 
 we will not withdraw from the european convention on human right we do need to make sure that both the convention and other instrument be fit for the circumstance we face at the moment and therefore of course we have be as we have make clear   look at the interpretation of some of those provision it would be a profound mistake to pull out of these instrument because the thing that would follow be that every other country in the world that adhere to these instrument would pull out of all their agreement with this country that would be catastrophic for actually deal with the problem 
 scotland have a proud heritage as of the world ’s great shipbuilding nation on behalf of the defence industry worker across ayrshire and beyond i welcome the large export deal for new warship ever secure by the uk do the prime minister agree that this show how under labour we can build on our proud past to secure a bright future for our shipbuilding industry 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be very pleased to get the call from the prime minister of norway on saturday night tell we that the uk have win this contract beat off competition from the us france and germany because of the quality of shipbuilding in this country this be a £ deal—15 year worth of shipbuilding particularly in place like the clyde and thousand of skilled job in scotland it show the importance of the defence industrial strategy and the importance of britain be take seriously again on the international stage it come on top of the record investment in defence that we have already announce early this year

 this week the global sumud flotilla which include british citizen set sail for gaza to break the illegal blockade and deliver much need aid in june a british boat the madleen be threaten and its crew detain but we take no action can the prime minister say what have be learn from this and what step be be take to protect the british citizen on this flotilla 
 my hon friend raise a really important issue in relation to the horrifying situation in gaza the israeli government be prevent urgently need aid from get in which be why we be now   see a man make famine and that should cause we all to pause and reflect we be work with other country to get aid in by any practical mean but land route be the only viable and sustainable mean of get aid into gaza on the scale that be require israel must lift the restriction to allow aid agency to deliver the life save supply that be so desperately need 
 so the budget date have finally be announce and once again scotland be some sort of distant afterthought the budget date have be leave to the hour because the government do not know how to resolve their countless counter bùrachs it be a budget date that have practically wreck scotland ’s budgetary process leave it almost impossible for we to pass a budget before christmas and leave great uncertainty for scotland ’s public service do you know mr speaker that they could not even be bother to notify the scottish government leave they to find this out on social medium i ask the prime minister how be this reset in relationship work out 
 the hon gentleman overlook the fact that at the last budget there be a record settlement for scotland—£50 a year he talk about support we have just win the norway frigate contract that be year of shipbuilding in scotland the snp minister have say what about that since sunday absolutely nothing i know we have another snp question in just a moment perhaps that will be the opportunity to welcome the deal that we have win and the job now for scotland 
 prime minister last year my online safety forum of child and young people from every secondary school and college in darlington find that of our year 10 and 12 have be contact by a stranger online a shocking failure that our online safety act will hopefully prevent go forward will he join i in call on the hon member for clacton nigel farage and all oppose to this vital act to pick a side be they with we parent and child protector or be they with the predator harm our child online 
 of course   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   be not here to represent his constituency in the house that he be elect to no he have fly to america to badmouth and talk down our country it be bad than that mr speaker if you can believe it he have go there to lobby the americans to impose sanction on this country that will harm work people you can not get more unpatriotic than that it be a disgrace the online safety act protect child from material on suicide self harm and online predator reform say it would scrap it when its leader be ask well what would you replace it with his answer be 
 there need to be a tech answer i do not know what that be 
 you can not run a country on do not know answer 
 mr speaker i be sure that you like i get to enjoy everything that uk hospitality have to offer over the summer local pub receive nomination in my community pub award i visit place include the   bull inn in battle the castle inn in pevensey the swan inn in dallington the new inn in westfield and sidley work man ’s club many of they tell i how hard hit they have be by labour ’s job tax ukhospitality estimate that job have already be lose and the british beer and pub association say that a pub a day will close this year can the prime minister name a single pub landlord who think that the deputy prime minister ’s employment rights bill will help rather than just make thing bad 
 i hope the hon gentleman pace out the visit to all those pub and do not do they all in go ukhospitality have welcome our small business plan which obviously apply to pub interruption yes it have the reason be that it permanently lower the business rate that they pay and it tackle late payment something for which it have be ask for a very very long time the conservatives talk about fix that but they never deliver we be deliver 
 my constituent have endure major fire in recent month across our community include that cause the devastating destruction of cumbernauld ’s iconic st mungo ’s church yet the scottish fire and rescue service be consult on downgrade cumbernauld fire station increase response time and put life at risk will the prime minister make representation to the scottish government that they should not risk life with cut to our vital emergency service 
 i think the whole house be sorry to hear about the awful fire that my hon friend ’s constituent have face include the destruction of st mungo ’s i know just how important that church be to the local community the scottish government have receive the large settlement in the history of devolution—£50 a year that should be focus on the issue that matter to her constituency i will take this up and make sure that we raise it with the scottish government 
 of all i refer to my comment early in the week since the prime minister ’s research be not up to scratch 
 george reid a former presiding officer of the scottish parliament and mp pass away over the summer he be a humanitarian to his very fingertip he abhor the demonisation of asylum seeker include those desperate enough to cross the channel in small boat figure publish by the house of commons library show that the number of asylum seeker who be force to cross increase dramatically after brexit as a result of our leave the dublin regulation instead of punch down and join in with the victim blaming of reform and the conservatives will the prime minister reject their isolationism and look to rejoin the dublin convention which every other country in western europe have join 
 there be nothing progressive about people cross the channel in small boat nothing at all we need to ensure that that stop 
 i agree with the hon gentleman on the question of the dublin agreement we have a return agreement with the whole of europe but it be rip up when we leave the eu by people who make promise that that would not be the case we be rebuild that relationship we have reset it and we now have a return agreement with france we would not need a single return scheme with france if we have not rip up the dublin agreement 
 we be at a very dangerous political moment with opinion poll warn that for the time in our country ’s history we risk the election of an extremist far right government we all have a duty to prevent that to do so do we not need to rebuild support through a return to real labour value with real action to tackle poverty and inequality a wealth tax on the super rich and ethical foreign policy that take a strong principle stand on war crime whoever commit they 
 we do stand at an important moment we can have the politic of renewal under this government or the politic of grievance under reform reform do not want to fix the problem it want the grievance to continue the last thing it want be improvement in the life of work people in this country because it feed off the problem and grievance be there that be the difference 
 admiral lord west be head of the royal navy chief of defence intelligence and a labour security minister and he sit on the intelligence and security committee when he write in the national press denounce what he call the 
 disgraceful decision to hand over ownership of the chagos archipelago 
 add that he do 
 not accept that the move be absolutely vital for our defence and intelligence as the prime minister claim 
 should we rely on his professional judgment or not 
 i have the misfortune to disagree with he 
 new mum and dad in my constituency tell i that of the thing they worry about most be whether they can afford the childcare that they need to be able to go back to work that be why it be great that parent will be able to save up to £ a year on nursery fee thank to this labour government do the prime minister agree that not only be invest in childcare important for tackle the cost of living crisis but it will help to remove barrier to decide to have child in the place 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter i be very proud to make our announcement about childcare on monday as she say rightly it will save family on average £ in a cost of living crisis but crucially it also apply from month to year under the previous government there be a disparity at age between child arrive at reception with some barely out of nappy and other quite articulate that lock in inequality for   life i be really pleased that the measure that we announce on monday unlock that ensure that every single child age get to the starting line in reception with a fair chance of go as far as their talent will take they 
 while the conservative party delude itself with the myth of endless fossil fuel the rest of we know just how ridiculous and reckless that be extract more oil and gas from the decline north sea basin will do nothing to protect energy security or job the prime minister himself have state 
 climate action be at the heart of this government ’s mission for the protection and prosperity of britain and the world 
 with a decision loom on the rosebank oil field will the prime minister prove that his word mean something and finally put an end to this climate wreck project 
 i do notice that the leader of the opposition go to scotland i think this week to announce that if she ever become prime minister which be extremely unlikely she would pull down £ of investment in renewable in scotland this be good secure job of the future absolutely reckless behaviour the opposition have not learn anything 
 the greens have a new leader unfortunately for the hon lady and we can now see what they really stand for withdrawal from nato at a moment like this totally unfunded spending that would blow up the economy and block all planning proposal they also have a leader who have make to say the least some very strange comment about woman there be only party deliver fairness and tackle the climate crisis and that be the labour party 
 prime minister in september you meet ex arsenal player michael thomas in portcullis house alongside other former footballer of the v11 when i host they in parliament last night the bbc broadcast the v11 documentary expose the fraud perpetrate against they and the financial abuse that they have suffer within the footballe system they have all suffer terrible financial loss but his majesty ’s revenue and customs be still chase they for taxis from fund that be defraud from they prime minister will you join i in meet michael thomas and other player to see how we can protect victim of fraud and instead go after the perpetrator of fraud 
 i will and i have meet michael thomas a number of time of course he have a special place in my heart have score that win goal at anfield when we win the league although the less say about win at anfield at the moment probably the well the serious point be that these be sporting hero who have bring we so much joy and they should have proper support from their sporting body on both health and welfare michael thomas and other be run an important campaign to bring this to our attention we do need a trust system that take the wellbeing of our sport people seriously particularly those in vulnerable position i know that the minister for sport be in contact with the campaigner 
 on a recent visit to the uk space agency base in my oxfordshire constituency i learn of the huge value create by our space sector generate more than £ for every £ invest give the government ’s decision to scrap the uksa as an executive agency will the prime minister guarantee its international credibility its operational independence and its budget and will he visit harwell campus to hear what our brilliant space company need from government 
 i thank the hon member for raise this important issue and reassure he that we do want to keep the huge expertise and knowledge of the uk space agency staff include those work in his constituency we have already secure almost £ in contract from the european space agency and this will cut cost reduce duplication so we can really focus on grow this important sector 
 since the start of the full scale invasion into ukraine russia have steal abduct and indoctrinate at least child it be of the most heinous crime of this war i warmly welcome this morning ’s announcement of an additional package of sanction on those perpetrate these crime and will the prime minister assure the house that he will do everything possible to return these child to their home 
 i acknowledge my hon friend ’s campaign on this really important issue russia ’s policy of force deportation and indoctrination of ukrainian child be despicable and anybody who have hear the story or see the picture can not be other than profoundly move we have take firm action this be issue that we discuss week ago in washington when i go over with other leader to ensure that we be all impose maximum pressure among the very many horror of the ukraine conflict this be right up there as of the absolute bad 
 like many i be deeply concerned that a police force deem it necessary to take armed officer to arrest a comedy writer from a flight some may have find mr linehan ’s comment offensive but that be not the point if we do not support speech that we do not like we do not support free speech will the prime minister commit to review our speech law to ensure that legitimate free expression be protect and will he condemn the culture within the public sector that prioritise this dangerous and perverse nonsense 
 i thank the hon member for raise this point he will have see that the commissioner put out a statement this morning in relation to this case i have be clear throughout that we must ensure that the police focus on the most serious issue and the issue that matter the most to our constituency and all community that include tackle issue such as antisocial behaviour knife crime and violence we have a long history of free speech in this country i be very proud of that and i will always defend it 
 in a week when the prime minister have work tirelessly to place clydeside glasgow and govan at the epicentre of type shipbuilding be he as perplex as i be at the   radio silence from the snp and the contempt that the snp continue to show for the defence sector do he agree that it be a contempt for job and growth and an year long contempt for scotland 
 i be perplexed that the minister have not welcome the deal it be a massive deal for scotland it be year of shipbuilding i would have expect the minister to hold a press conference to celebrate what we have do with this deal those year of shipbuilding be extremely important to the clyde and many industry and they be a reflection of the professionalism and dedication that worker in scotland have show over many year i urge the minister to come forward and welcome this deal 
 for the final question i call sir john hayes 
 mr speaker i know you will agree   that flag and banner in bring national pride nourish individual sense of worth and nurture our shared sense of belong will the prime minister take step to ensure that across every part of our kingdom alongside the cross of st george in england st patrick in ireland st andrew in scotland and the red dragon in wales our flag be fly on every government and public building hospital school police station and railway station for every briton deserve the chance to see a forest of flagpole and the flutter of the union jack 
 i share the right hon gentleman ’s pride in our country ’s flag it represent our history our heritage and our value that be why we display it i be the labour leader who put the union jack on the membership card for the labour party and i be very proud to do so it belong to all of we we should be proud of it and value it 
 on a point of order mr speaker i be chair of the public and commercial services trade union group in parliament as member will know pcs member from the house ’s security division be take strike action today these be professional dedicated and committed staff and it take a lot to motivate they to take strike action their sense of grievance there be a clear difference of view between the management of the house and the union about how we have arrive at this situation could i use this mechanism to urge the senior management of the house to seek another meeting with the union to clarify the situation and to come up with a reasonable offer that will resolve this dispute i do not wish to see our dedicated staff outside of work on this basis they provide we with the security that we need 
 i thank the right hon member for give notice of his point of order while it be strictly not a matter for the chair i would agree that it be in everyone ’s interest to work together to resolve matter i hope that we can get people around the table rather than strike i do not want to go into further detail and i think it be well we leave it at this stage 
 before we come to the minute rule motion i wish to make a short announcement about the house ’s sub judice resolution a coroner ’s inquest have be open into the death of simone white and those proceeding be now sub judice however give the significant public interest in address this matter i as speaker have decide to grant a waiver from the house ’s resolution relate to matter sub judice in respect of any inquest into the death of uk citizen or resident result from methanol poisoning overseas member may therefore refer to the case in the course of proceeding but i would urge they to avoid say anything that might prejudice any future criminal or civil proceeding in the uk 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require travel advice issue by the secretary of state and other person to include guidance about the risk of methanol poisoning and for connected purpose 
 i have be work closely on this issue on behalf of of my constituent chloe lassetter who alongside her family sue neil tom and amanda have be fight to raise awareness of the danger of methanol poisoning abroad follow the tragic death of simone white last year as member may have see from medium coverage at the time simone be travel with her friend bethany in laos they be stay in a small riverside town about hour north of the capital it be a hub for backpacker travel across south east asia it be there that simone and her friend consume free shot of alcohol offer at the hostel 
 the next day both feel unwell but they carry on with their plan hour later after board a bus to their next destination thing worsen bethany faint simone vomit they be eventually take to a local hospital but doctor have no idea what be wrong and initially suspect food poisoning still confused and deteriorate the girl make it to a private hospital i can not imagine how frightened and confused they must have be at this point but sadly by then it be too late for simone she start have seizure during dialysis and be eventually take for emergency brain surgery the surgery relieve the pressure but cause bleeding and the other side of her brain start to swell the result confirm methanol poisoning be not available until week later but by then simone have sadly already pass away 
 although bethany recover follow her hospitalisation other young people fall victim to suspect methanol poisoning have drunk at the same hostel young australians young danish woman and an american all lose their life as the australian prime minister say in november this be every parent ’s bad nightmare my heart go out to all the family who lose love one in the most unbelievably tragic circumstance 
 over the last year i have learn so much about simone who be a much love young woman she have a brilliant life ahead of she and when i attend her funeral it be clear that she be deeply love by her friend and family 
 a year ago like so many of we here i do not know much about methanol poisoning yet over people die from it every single year worldwide this be such a huge danger but barely any of we know about it i also go backpack after university but never know about the danger and sadly the same be true of so many of our young people that must change for member who be less aware than we should be methanol be tasteless and have only a faint smell make it impossible to tell if a drink have be contaminate when consume it can lead to a coma convulsion blindness nervous system damage and death medical specialist say drink as little as ml of methanol can be fatal but it be sometimes add to drink because it be cheap than alcohol 
 since their devastating loss simone ’s family have campaign tirelessly to prevent similar tragedy from affect other family alongside simone ’s friend bethany they have be raise awareness of the danger of methanol poisoning and it be an honour early this year to help to arrange a parliamentary drop in session on the subject alongside my hon friend   the member for orpington gareth bacon   and   the hon member for dartford jim dickson the family be join by representative of the travel industry the national poisons information service the british toxicology society and the foreign commonwealth and development office to educate mps and the message be clear awareness save life but only when government guidance be accurate clear and consistent 
 sadly current official travel advice be fall short in some high risk country there be very little warning at all where advice do exist it be vague and understate traveller be tell that certain drink might carry a risk or that they should exercise caution this be not a matter of caution this be about a lethal preventable danger i appreciate that the foreign commonwealth and development office have update the health section of the travel advice on its website but we must do more to make the warning clear and more explicit so that information be more readily available to everyone the government ’s travel aware website have an informative section on methanol poisoning but more must be do    to make that advice and guidance well know to young people before they travel as thing stand they really have to search to find it 
 my bill support by my hon friend   the member for orpington and the hon member for dartford for cheadle mr morrison   and for lewisham north vicky foxcroft propose a straightforward proportionate solution it do not attempt to police alcohol sale abroad it do not require costly programme or enforcement it simply require the government to provide prominent clear and consistent guidance about methanol poisoning for country where the risk be know to exist other government have already take step to warn their citizen australia ’s smartraveller service provide unambiguous practical advice and reach young traveller through target campaign we should do no less and we must not be leave behind 
 family such as simone ’s who have endure unimaginable grief be not ask for the impossible they be ask for honesty clarity and actionable guidance so that other family do not have to suffer the same loss we have already show in this house that collaboration between family expert and parliamentarian can and do raise awareness now it be time to turn awareness into action i know that ministers in the foreign office be well aware of simone ’s story as we have exchange many letter on the topic and the foreign office kindly host i my hon friend the member for orpington and the family at a meeting early this year i thank they for their engagement to date and i look forward to continue work with they as i know they understand the grave risk at stake 
 as simone ’s mother sue white say 
 if it can happen to simone it can happen to anybody 
 so let ’s start the process today to prevent future tragedy i commend the bill to the house 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that laura trott gareth bacon jim dickson tom morrison and vicky foxcroft present the bill 
 laura trott accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday may and to be print bill 
 i inform the house that i have not select the amendment i call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer 
 i beg to move 
 that this house note recent report that the government be consider a wide range of increase to taxis on property note the prime minister ’s commitment last year not to impose capital gains tax on primary residence and call on the government not to introduce an annual property levy which would tax the family home high rate of council tax or a land value tax or to lower the threshold or far increase liability to inheritance tax for example by change the year gift rule 
 i trust you have a good recess mr speaker i be absolutely certain that the deputy prime minister also have a good recess we see many photograph of she down at the seaside just off the coast in a rubber dingy rather like many of the other photograph we see over the summer give this government ’s reckless policy on illegal migration she be probably celebrate the acquisition of another property for her property empire but that celebration be perhaps slightly ting with a nagging doubt as to whether she have indeed pay enough stamp duty well we will get to the bottom of that in due course 
 those who could not avoid pay the taxis impose by this government be business right up and down our country many of which i take the time to visit during the recess in the leisure sector alone some job have be destroy by the national insurance rise and this have particularly affect those take their job young worker part time worker and female worker job be be destroy 
 while the deputy prime minister be lounge on her boat with her wine this government be all at sea like a cork bob on the tide with no control over the event swirl around they when it come to the economy although eclipse by the calamity around illegal migration we see recently the panicked reshuffle of the treasury front bench i offer my congratulation to the exchequer secretary to the treasury   the hon member for chipping barnet dan tomlinson   and warmly welcome he to his new role however i should also tell he that he be join a sink ship whose captain have just have all her authority strip from she while all his comrade down below deck be fiercely try to bail it out i also offer a fond farewell to the former chief secretary to the treasury   the right hon member for bristol north west darren jones who no doubt think he be very clever when he leapt off the sink ship he will not be feel quite so clever when he discover that the place to which they have send he be even more dysfunctional than the treasury front bench 
 among all this news of arrival to our shore we have have a cruel summer of speculation around tax we have see in the sky cloud of kite fly largely by   the treasury as to what taxis it be go to put up it have all be tax tax and tax i be remind of the beatles song taxman 
 i ’ll tax the street 
 if you try to sit i ’ll tax your seat 
 if you get too cold i ’ll tax the heat 
 if you take a walk i ’ll tax your foot 
 when it come to tax it be not so much good day sunshine as help!”[laughter okay it be a bit hammy but it be worth a try i be go to try penny lane as well but i draw the line there 
 it be worth examine how we get to this point for a reckoning for our country be surely come this will be a story for all time 
 will my right hon friend give way 
 i will do so momentarily 
 it start with broken promise this be a party that say during the run up to the general election that it have no intention of raise taxis left right and centre and yet within a month or this government do precisely that with devastating consequence tax rise on business that stifle growth they talk down the economy by confect a £ black hole that do not exist what an irony it be that it be they who bring in the office for budget responsibility to decide whether that £ black hole exist and that the obr say it could not legitimise the claim the government be wrong 
 what happen with spending and borrowing it get completely out of control the combination of pass on price rise because of the national insurance increase and the extra borrowing and spending have lead to high inflation we be an outlier when it come to inflation 
 will the right hon member give way 
 in a moment 
 that in turn have see interest rate high for long and the servicing cost on our national debt now run at over £ a year more than twice our defence spend i will now give way to whoever be try to intervene behind i 
 would my right hon friend agree that correct this loss of market confidence demand decisive action from the government at the budget and that that decisive action can not be take solely on the tax side the tax side be what have drive we into this loop we need decisive action on spending and particularly on welfare if we be to see some restoration of market confidence and get ourselves out of this rut 
 my right hon friend as ever be absolutely right the reality as we see in the bond yield at the moment be that the market have no confidence in the ability of this government to get on top of spending we see the farce of a government who come into office scrap the £ of welfare saving that be already bake into the obr ’s scorecard because we have bring they in and attempt to bring forward their own reform only for their back benchers to vote   they down my right hon friend be so right this government do not have the will or the plan to deal with spending and that be at the heart of the reason why we will all be punish and pay the price of more taxis come the budget in november 
 i commend the shadow chancellor for bring forward this subject for debate he clearly share my deep concern that i have and that i think everyone in this chamber should have that the government be consider a further tax on property despite the fact that the prime minister commit to not impose capital gain tax on resident of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland last year it be the family inheritance tax this year those who own property those who have scrimp and save for their house those who be middle class those hard worker have now become the late target of labour tax policy 
 the hon gentleman be entirely right of course if the government have get into a situation where they be have to scrabble around and look at property taxis as we be debate this afternoon than really nothing be safe from the taxman under this government 
 i gently remind the right hon member that since this labour government come to power interest rate have be cut time a vote of confidence in our chancellor fix the foundation of our economy that save the average family on an average tracker mortgage in my constituency over £ a month will he remind i what happen to interest rate when his party be in power 
 as the hon lady will know interest rate be of the key tool in monetary policy and be apply to bring down inflation while she be right that there have be reduction in the level of the base rate there should have be many more the reason be the evidence be there that this government have stoke inflation inflation be still rise it be at twice the level or thereabout that it be on the day of the general election when a government stoke inflation we pay the price through high interest rate and that be precisely what have be happen 
 my right hon friend be right to highlight the massive impact of these tax rise on so many family and business up and down the country will he comment on how we can have a deputy prime minister who have admit avoid pay the tax that she owe and who continue in office and this from a party that call for the resignation of people for far low offence do that not expose the rank hypocrisy that seem to run right through this government 
 if the right hon lady want to make the rule she should live by they that message will go out to business and family up and down the country there be no way that they can avoid the juggernaut of taxis that be come down the track 
 in return for the right hon member ’s generosity in give way i will say something pleasant about the last   conservative government interruption i know wait for it it will be just thing 
 the last government allow council like westmorland and furness run by the liberal democrats to double council tax on home it be right to do that because excessive home ownership annihilate community in the lake and the dale the west country and elsewhere but can i encourage the conservatives and the party in government now to do something that would do much more to limit the number of home than that bring in a new planning category of use so that national park and council can manage the number and save community 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind word about the conservative party i be sure that they be deeply feel and very genuine what the deputy prime minister should be do be deliver more home it be quite clear that the target of home which the government claim they will deliver at the rate of a year will not be meet i be quite happy to be prove wrong but i very much suspect that i will not be unfortunately 
 we have end up in a situation in which a huge black hole be loom the national institute of economic and social research put it at possibly as much as £ the economic mismanagement of the labour party be a recurrent theme in the october budget the government ’s there be headroom of about £ against the fiscal rule that plus £ more be blow by the time of the spring statement the emergency budget once again it appear that considerably more have be blow all over again 
 that be no surprise the u turn on winter fuel payment and on welfare reform which we have already discuss in this debate lead to unfunded commitment of around £ unfunded commitment after the chancellor have say that the labour party would never find itself in that position what she say have simply not happen what signal do it send to the market when the government can not control spending in the long term it will be interesting to see what the office for budget responsibility have to say about its forecast for growth in recent time year bond yield have hit a year high we be pay more to borrow than greece there be a potential debt crisis loom and this country could be on the brink all on labour ’s watch 
 the government inherit bond yield high than those in many other country right now bond yield be go up in japan germany and the united states be the chancellor responsible for all that 
 there be no doubt that under the previous government there be a need to support the economy that involve the expenditure of £ not least on the furlough scheme i do not remember the hon gentleman ’s party argue at the time that we should not do that in fact it argue that we should go far still the conservative government step in support job and save we from go into mass unemployment that many fear would be bad than even in the 1980s and i take great pride in that but we be where we be now and what the government should be do be grow the economy stoke up   business sentiment get taxis down and get the economy move but they be do precisely the opposite 
 be not the difference now that we be see stagflation high inflation and the economy not grow as it should be we be therefore see job loss and unemployment go up every month under this labour government unless they do something drastically different it will only get bad and that will impact on our growth prospect and therefore on the prosperity not just of our nation but of the individual who work and try to thrive here 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we be see high inflation anaemic growth high gilt yield and a pound that have be plummet in recent time all those be signal flash red on the dashboard 
 instead of get a grip on spending and get taxis down the government have be out there pitch roll yet more taxis over the summer we have see briefing to the press suggest tax rise on property the labour party have an opportunity this afternoon to rule out those possibility and the minister should do just that when he respond 
 there have be a suggestion that there will be change to the private residence relief under the capital gain tax regime that would strike at the heart of our country as a property own democracy people would be penalise simply for sell up and move home it would have clear implication by bung up the property market and clear economic implication by cause friction in the process of people move from part of the country to another often in search of work it would discourage downsize even though that would be beneficial in provide more home for people to live in before the election the prime minister say that there never be a policy of that type so it do not need to be rule out but let we rule it out just in case anyone pretend that there be such a policy when he respond will the minister confirm that he stand by the word of the prime minister 
 secondly there have be a suggestion of an annual tax on home what a tax on aspiration what a tax on people who have save hard and manage to get on the property ladder but who will then be stick with annual taxis what about those who be asset rich but income poor and can not afford to pay be they expect to sell up will the minister rule out that possibility and put people ’s mind at rest 
 if that be not enough we hear that the government may be consider change to the gift regime in inheritance tax they be not content just to pulverise farmer and family business and to see those business and farm break up when they be pass on from generation to another because of the imposition of tax in fact it be a labour government in the 1970 who bring in the relief that this government have choose to abolish the inheritance tax yield will double over this parliament the opposition say enough be enough we should not punish parent who wish to pass something on to their child socialist do not understand that we do not all stand as atomised individual we work   together as family and community we care about each other we care about the people we love and it be right that we have the opportunity to pass something on to they 
 i thank the shadow chancellor for introduce this debate on such an important issue property and asset be vital to the country and to people on the lifetime limit for inheritance tax over the past year everyone will have hear the government tell farmer and family business to get their affair in order and to plan not have a limit on the lifetime cap be what allow they to plan if that be cut or the cap be not in the right place it will negate every argument that the government have make in the past year to justify their family farm and family business tax will the minister please acknowledge that and rule out any change to the cap which would penalise family farm and business 
 my hon friend have put it brilliantly and succinctly and she be absolutely right in their horror in their recoil from the inheritance tax change that be exactly what farmer and family business owner have be do think about alternative the year rule have be of those alternative and it would be a really heartless and extraordinarily cruel moment if the government be to shut that down as well 
 my right hon friend be explain the situation in his usual powerful way if as seem likely the government impose capital gain tax on a person ’s principal private residence will he as mitigation consider whether there should at least be indexation allowance to provide some relief from the horror that i fear be about to be inflict on my constituent he will remember that the finance act abolish that relief on other property i suspect that the government will not be sympathetic to such a suggestion give what happen in but it would at least take the edge off the imposition of taxis on the sale of a person ’s principal private residence 
 my right hon friend raise his point in his usual eloquent manner that be a question for the minister and i hope that when he rise to the dispatch box he will rule out our concern in their entirety in the event that he can not perhaps he will choose to answer my right hon friend ’s inquiry 
 be it not the case that those in the labour party have a clear misunderstanding because they have no business experience those on the government front bench have no business experience in set up company or understand the meaning of business taxis the experience be simply not there labour will talk about tax wealth but do it not understand that if we tax wealth we will get less of it 
 it have be estimate that about high net worth individual have leave our country in the period in which this government have be in power a consequence of that tax just walk out of the door be that we will require somewhere around a of a to half a people on average earning to make up the difference this be not a case of good riddance to wealth the government should as the conservative party would encourage and turbocharge wealth at every turn 
 will my hon friend give way 
 if i be an hon friend i will certainly give way 
 i be sure hansard will correct i 
 the right hon gentleman just make some comment about high net worth or high value individual in my constituency i be particularly interested in individual on low income in peterborough i represent a city with of the high level of those employ on hour contract and in chronically insecure work do he not agree that his party often want all the spending but none of the funding for delivery he talk about reduce taxation for some of those with high net worth but will he also talk about which doctor surgery in my constituency would suffer cut under his plan which individual would receive no protection for their employment right and how the people of peterborough would be bad off because he want to reduce the spending that will fix the foundation of this country 
 the hon gentleman refer to cut spending his party attempt to cut spending but entirely fail to do so my point be that if he want money to spend on public service he need to cut welfare and should worry about how to do so i do not know how he vote when that be put to the test in this house but if he in any way vote against his own government and against get on top of the welfare bill he should ask his own question of himself 
 as for those on low income they be precisely the people who be now be devastate by the increase in national insurance there be not just an increase in the rate but a substantial reduction in the threshold at which national insurance kick in which have mean high unemployment in particular among young worker part time worker woman and people get that vital job so that they can get themselves on a career path they be the people whom the labour government be punish most 
 be that not exactly the point that the top of earner pay almost of income tax if we lose they we damage the people who need the support and the investment from the very taxpayer we have just scar off should not the reverse be happen we should attract more people into this country to spend more money so that we have more money for such service through tax collection 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i have already share with the house the classic example of the number of people who have leave this country because of a punitive tax regime and the cost of that 
 far to the excellent point make by my hon friend   the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans the labour party denigrate wealthy individual who choose to come to this country however it be about not just the tax that they provide but the job and opportunity they create by invest in constituency up and down the country this country have prosper for hundred of year by be open and welcome to   inward investment if we lose that we lose a key plank of the competitiveness and growth that have be associate with our economy 
 that be right we live in a highly mobile world it be easy for people with substantial wealth or money to invest to go anywhere in the world we have to remain competitive and this government be make we less competitive my right hon friend refer to unemployment but just look at the record should we have expect any more from this government no not really every single labour government in history have leave unemployment high when they leave office than it be at the time they come into office what have we see on unemployment since this government have be in office it have increase every single month since they have be in power 
 the right hon gentleman have spend the past minute circle around figure gather by a consultancy that aid the super wealthy to migrate from this country where be the conservative party get its economic idea from it speak volume that he have spend so much time up to this point speak for the high net worth individual serve by that consultancy and his previous point be about inheritance tax which be pay by only of all estate in the uk if he have any idea what will the conservative party do to grow the economy for the benefit of all people in this country 
 the hon lady ask where we be get our idea from where we be not get they from be from academic and researcher who believe in tax wealth and who now sit there on the treasury bench or in other place where they advise no they talk on a regular basis about tax property wealth share and asset of any description that they can think of but that be the road to ruin she ask where we get our idea from and i will tell she i set up my own business in the 1980 from absolutely nothing i grow it from scratch and then i take it over to america and grow a business there i have live breathe and eat business most of my life i also go up and down the country to speak to other such business they be the people who understand what need to be do on the tax front and who have to live with the red tape that her party be bring in to tie they down they be the people whom this party be listen to 
 the right hon gentleman have talk at great length about tax the wealthy but he have omit of the suggestion that come forth over the summer which be to get rid of the punitive council tax system which tax poverty and deprivation in this country the former conservative leader of hartlepool borough council famously cheer when he put up council tax on deprive people in hartlepool why be the conservative party and now reform that former conservative leader have now defect to reform so attach to that regressive system 
 i think that council tax different variant of it revaluation and so on be thing that government should look at because we do not want they to be entirely static there can always be reform and change i will observe however that the average   council tax pay in labour area be demonstrably high than the equivalent taxis in conservative area that come down to the approach that a conservative council take to spending and to ensure that council be efficiently run rather than the profligate approach of the labour party 
 of the suggestion make to the government early this year be from conservative run hampshire county council to increase the council tax on my constituent by that be block by this government by the secretary of state will the right hon gentleman join i in condemn conservative run hampshire county council ’s proposal to increase council tax by 
 i be not go to get into specific thing go on in the hon gentleman ’s area how can i be expect to opine with authority on something of that nature relate to his constituency interruption hold on my general point stand the simple fact be that labour control local authority charge more in council tax than conservative run council do 
 rise 
 order member can not keep stand up and wave their hand in the air the right hon gentleman have to give way 
 what the right hon gentleman have say be not a fact the reality in my region be that milton keynes the labour run local authority have low taxis than all the surround tory authority include in northamptonshire which have fail over and over again conservative and now reform council have fail as have buckinghamshire while milton keynes have be label by the local government association as of the well run council it still deliver low council tax than all those tory run authority 
 it be a simple matter of logic that even if the hon lady ’s assertion be true i do not know whether it be or not it do not contradict the point that i make 
 be it not the current prime minister who say 
 not a penny more on your council tax 
 be the shadow chancellor aware of how that work out 
 in a word badly 
 a moment ago the shadow chancellor suggest that he would not get into speculation but this whole debate be premise on medium speculation i ask he to comment on an actual proposal that be make to the government by a conservative run county council to increase local council tax for my constituent by so he be ask we to vote on a motion about media speculation but he will not comment on an actual proposal
