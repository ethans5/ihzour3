i would like to start by thank all right hon and hon member for their invaluable contribution during the passage of the bill to date and in particular member of the public bill committee for provide insight scrutiny and debate i be honour to have take on responsibility for this bill it be a watershed piece of legislation and the most significant public health intervention since the ban on smoking   in public place in it will establish a smokefree generation by gradually end the sale of tobacco product across the uk so that a child turn this year will never be able to be legally sell tobacco save countless life in the process it will strengthen exist power to reduce the harm of hand smoke in public space in keep with our manifesto commitment to the british people it will outlaw the manipulative promotion of vape to child to protect the next   generation from become hook on nicotine finally it will implement robust measure to strengthen enforcement activity 
 i do not need to tell anyone in this chamber that tobacco kill we all know that what hon member may not know be just how much it kill the rate at which it kill and the devastation it cause for individual family and community across the country let i remind hon member that tobacco kill more people than any other preventable cause of death around people in the uk lose their life to tobacco every year it rob an average of year off the life expectancy of smoker it substantially increase the risk of many major health condition throughout people ’s life such as stroke diabetes heart disease stillbirth dementia and asthma this daily tragedy continue unabated with someone be admit to hospital because of smoke almost every minute day in day out with no end in sight 
 tobacco harm be not feel equally either our most disadvantaged community suffer most with household live in smoking induce poverty in blackpool of pregnant woman still smoke at the time of delivery compare with in kensington and chelsea over a quarter of people with a long term mental health condition smoke 
 beyond the immeasurable cost to life in the uk the staggering economic impact of tobacco on our nhs can not be ignore the treatment of smoking relate disease consume approximately £ a year of vital nhs and social care resource the cost of smoking to our economy be even great £ be lose in productivity every year far outweigh the tax receipt it bring in of around £ the bill be a vital step to break the devastating cycle of tobacco addiction and safeguard future generation from a lifetime of ill health 
 but the world move forward and we can not ignore the alarming rise of youth vaping while vaping be less harmful than smoke and can be an effective quit aid for adult smoker child should never vape however in the past year youth vaping have more than double in to year old try vape in and that be no accident it be in part due to the deliberate branding and advertisement of vape to our child with brightly coloured packaging and entice sweet like flavour a calculate strategy to hook young people on nicotine we can not afford to wait to act 
 i turn to the government amendment which seek to strengthen the bill and ensure great clarity as we create the smokefree generation and strengthen age restriction on vape and nicotine product we want to support retailer in take appropriate step to ensure they do not sell to customer under the age of sale new clause and government amendment to to to to and be a package of amendment and consequential amendment to the bill they seek to remove potential ambiguity for retailer regard the use of digital identity for verify the age of prospective customer when sell tobacco vaping and nicotine product 
 in committee members raise concern that the list of identity document to satisfy the defence for a person charge with sell product to someone under the age of sale be limited and query the inclusion of other form of physical and digital identity these amendment remove the list of physical id from the bill and instead   provide power for the secretary of state and the department of health in northern ireland to specify in regulation the step that may be take to verify a customer ’s age to meet the requirement for the defence this revised approach well future proof the defence against development in identification process and provide the potential to recognise digital id as well as physical id in the context of the defence support the widespread use of digital id 
 the amendment provide the opportunity for effective interaction with part of the data use and access bill that be currently go through parliament which include provision relate to digital verification service digital verification service provide an opportunity to securely verify age for in person and online sale we will continue to work closely with the department for science innovation and technology and other departments when develop the regulation 
 new clause provide a similar power for scottish ministers to prescribe in regulation the step that should be take to establish a customer ’s age as a defence to an age of sale offence that will enable scottish ministers to respond to change in technology and consumer behaviour which may move away from the presentation of a physical document 
 the last labour government take bold action to prohibit display of tobacco product to protect child and young people from be entice into addiction and to create a more supportive environment for adult seek to quit the bill go far and give power to limit the display of a wide range of product include herbal smoking product cigarette paper vape and nicotine product government amendment and will alter the power in the bill for england wales and northern ireland that regulate display of product and their price so that they also cover tobacco relate device as be discuss in committee pipe heated tobacco device and bong be currently display in shop and can have the effect of promote tobacco usage the amendment will ensure that we can make regulation to stop product that facilitate the consumption of tobacco be openly display by retailer 
 the bill ban the sale of vape nicotine product and cigarette paper from vend machine in england wales and northern ireland and restate the exist ban on tobacco vend machine we know that vend machine be use to bypass age of sale restriction and to undertake proxy purchase on behalf of people under the age of sale government amendment and be clarify amendment that make the scope of the prohibition on vend machine absolutely clear as be discuss in committee the government ’s position be that the protection from tobacco sale from vending machines england regulations already apply where a customer have a coupon receipt or token purchase elsewhere that can be redeem at a machine we be amend the clause so that all machine that dispense product in connection with a sale be clearly capture by the ban 
 the bill strengthen the enforcement regime to support law abide retailer while take action against those who break the rule along with introduce new fix penalty notice and new power to create a licensing system the bill re enact provision on restrict premise order and restrict sale order those be exist   measure that local authority trading standard in england and wales can use when deal with a retailer that persistently breach restriction that ensure there be a range of tool in the enforcement armoury so that trading standard officer can act quickly and effectively against rogue retailer 
 government amendment and clarify a point raise in committee by remove a duplicative and unnecessary provision that would prevent a business or individual from operate a vend machine for the sale of tobacco vaping or nicotine product follow the issuing of a restrict premise order or a restricted sale order give that the bill already prohibit the use of vend machine for tobacco vaping or nicotine product there be no need for restrict premise order and restrict sale order to expressly prohibit the use of vend machine together the government amendment will improve the implementation and enforceability of measure in the bill to ensure the most effective protection for the public and i commend they to the house 
 turn to the other amendment in the group i thank hon member for their scrutiny of the bill so far when i wind up i will try to cover the key theme that be touch on on the amendment that seek to undermine the smokefree generation i be sure we will hear argument from some hon member who have be listen to the tobacco industry ’s argument and myth about how people should be free to make their own choice i would say to they that smoke kill third of its user quarter of people wish they have never start smoking and the majority want to quit that be not freedom of choice the tobacco industry take away that choice with addiction usually at a young age 
 on smokefree place we have be clear in england we intend to consult on extend smokefree outdoor place to outside school child ’s playground and hospital but not to outdoor hospitality setting at this time no smoker want to harm people but with hand smoke they do if people can smell smoke they be inhale it this be particularly important for child pregnant woman and people with pre exist health condition such as asthma or heart disease the only way to stop this harm be to stop people smoke around other while i understand hon member proposal to list specific place in the bill or to add additional limit to the use of the power it be right that we consult on the detail before make regulation and have the necessary power to protect child and vulnerable people from the harm of hand smoking 
 i be grateful to the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on smoking and health my hon friend   the member for city of durham mary kelly foy   and   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman for their long stand support for the bill through their amendment they highlight the importance of retain a focus on support for current smoker that be why we be invest an extra £ for local stop smoke service this year and work to ensure that all nhs hospital offer opt out smoking cessation service into routine care i hope they will be pleased that we have be able to confirm the extension of the swap to stop scheme for the come year with up to £ of funding to provide free vape starter kit for smoker to use as quit aid 
 on the group of amendment relate to vape advertising we realise that product be deliberately market at child be unacceptable which be why we have include a commitment to stop vape be brand and advertise to child the government be also invest £ of new funding for the come year for national trading standards to tackle underage illicit tobacco and vape and to boost the trading standard workforce by recruit new apprentice provide additional boot on the ground

 i thank my hon friend in particular for the work she be do on behalf of her select committee i be also grateful for the national debate that have be spark by the programme adolescence it be incredibly important that we act in these area the power that come in last week to take down illegal content but also the power that be come in later this year in june will mean that all those publishing content must make sure it be age appropriate that will be a step forward i be watch the impact of these new power closely and i will act accordingly if they be not strong enough 
 significant concern be raise in the recent westminster hall debate on the implementation of the online safety act will the minister take urgent step to well categorise online platform to well protect woman and girl online

 i call the shadow minister 
 tragically flaw in datum and its processing be pose grave risk to woman and girl the sullivan report expose serious failing in the collection and use of biological sex datum which be often be replace with gender identity the report highlight the risk that pose to the safe delivery of health service policing and security the health secretary have already show leadership on this issue but to date the secretary of state have remain silent when do he have sight of the sullivan report and when do he intend to act on it 
 the hon gentleman be right to ask that question the government be act on it and the health secretary have be act on it i myself have contact all government departments on the back of that important review to ensure that every department be aware of it of some of its content and of its relevance to different department and i will be meet the author in the come day and week to ensure that she be satisfied with the action that the government be take 
 if he will have discussion with cabinet colleague on provide additional support for research into motor neurone disease 
 we work closely with the department of health and social care to support research into this terrible disease uk research and innovation invest £ in mnd research in and it also play a key role in fund the underpinning research that benefit medical research more generally since the medical research council and the national institute for health and care research have award £ to mnd project lead by scottish research organisation 
 my hon friend will know of the important work of mnd campaigner include my constituent mark sommerville who be seek more government investment in mnd research i recognise that any further plan for research and development investment would be outline after the spending review in june but can my hon friend give some reassurance to those with mnd and their family for whom time matter so much that the department be give consideration to boost investment in mnd research work with key partner to accelerate the development of new treatment 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for draw attention to the work of the mark sommerville foundation in this important area government funder be invest in mnd research to accelerate progress let i give just example through uk research and innovation and the national institute for health and care research the government be invest £ in the mnd translational accelerator lead by dementias platform uk the aim of the fund project be to accelerate the development of treatment for mnd 
 it be good to hear that there be continue investment in the search for therapy and indeed cure to deal with this horrific disease but even if therapy do emerge of the frustration in get they to patient may be the inability of scientist to obtain access to clinical trial in life sciences vision publish in a number of group combine to look into access to clinical trial in the uk and the possibility of increase the number of such trial but acceleration have not be good i chair the all party parliamentary group for life science and of the comment i hear most frequently in the industry be about the need for a more focused effort in this regard would the minister consider establish a clinical trial taskforce in her department to drive this important work forward 
 the government be do and have do a great deal we have continue to support this work through both ukri and the nihr and a large amount of funding have go into clinical research however i should be happy to discuss the issue far with the right hon gentleman and to let he know what more work could be do on clinical trial 
 what plan his department have to support a uk space launch 
 be a leader in the new space race be vital to protect the uk ’s security and deliver on our mission for growth the government have invest in a range of launch capability include spaceport in cornwall and scotland and also launch vehicle most recently we invest £ to enable the uk rocket manufacturer orbex to complete the construction of its launch vehicle 
 what work be the department do to ensure that the uk space sector be a launch pad for innovation and investment and create skilled job both commercial and in the defence sector across scotland and the united kingdom as a whole 
 we have space skill across the uk but we have particular expertise in scotland i enjoy visit glasgow recently to see how every part of its economy support the space sector especially the small satellite manufacturing sector several launch operation include orbex be target orbital launch from saxavord spaceport in shetland this year that be a testament to the innovation take place throughout the uk and specifically in scotland 
 if that space launch happen and i believe it will it will happen at saxavord in unst and the secretary of state will be very welcome to join we when it do for the uk space sector as a whole to recognise the full opportunity we have we need to get serious about the delivery of the government ’s space strategy last year the national audit office identify a number of challenge that the strategy face when will we hear the government ’s response 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman that when we come into office we do not inherit a clear strategy for deliver on our priority for space that strategy be now be develop the investment we be make as a department and a government into space and the way we be make sure that our relationship with the european space agency be deliver for the british sector we have more grant be deliver in the uk in the late round of funding than any other country show that we be deliver i share his enthusiasm and certainty that a launch will happen this year and i very much look forward to be there alongside he to witness it 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of ofcom ’s reporting of mobile coverage 
 i be sure that every member of the house would agree that ofcom ’s reporting of mobile coverage be rather over optimistic and do not reflect people ’s live experience i be absolutely determined to change that and ofcom be help i to do so 
 my constituent lesley suffer from multiple health condition include epilepsy and live with the constant risk of seizure her family rely on broadband to use the landline but recently the broadband go down for several day which mean she be completely unable to make call because of the ongoing problem with mobile coverage in llandudno will the minister agree to meet i to discuss how we can safeguard vulnerable customer such as lesley and address the issue in llandudno 
 i think my hon friend also have a problem at of her university which we be go to try to deal with as well she have write to i and i will write back as soon as possible but perhaps we could short cut that with a meeting i be conscious that for medical condition the resilience of someone ’s connectivity be just as important as the day to day coverage 
 i thank the minister for his candour and honesty he be of the most effective experienced and able ministers in the government have pay those compliment can i encourage he to visit shropshire where there be still too many notspot perhaps of the reason be that this country have only mobile network operator be it not time that we have more competition finally be the share rural network agreement likely to hit its target by the end of this year 
 the shared rural network will reach its target the right hon member make a very good point which be that frankly the connectivity that people think they be get from ofcom be simply not what they be actually get their phone look as though it have lot of bar and be say g but they can not even download an app to park their car we have to transform that across the whole of the uk in the end most of that be down to the industry and i want to make sure that we remove some of the barrier to further investment in the industry to improve mobile connectivity for every single member of the house 
 what step his department be take to ensure that small platform be adequately regulate to protect child from online harm 
 i welcome the national conversation take place about how we protect child online the online safety act require all regulate user to user   and search service to comply with the illegal content and child safety rule the illegal content duty come into effect last week and i be closely monitor the impact of these duty on online safety 
 many school in my constituency of mid dunbartonshire use mobile phone as an educational tool yet along with this learning opportunity come easy access to site post horrendous content i would like to know how the government plan to tackle small foreign base website expose people to graphic content what step be the department take to ensure that small platform be adequately regulate to protect child from online harm 
 i be grateful to the hon member for her question and the manner in which she express it which recognise the complexity of smartphone use the benefit as well as the potential harmful aspect i can assure she that as of last week the power to demand that illegal content be take down have come into force i accept that there be still illegal content online but i be closely watch the way that ofcom respond i think that in the come day and week she will see action show how assertive it intend to be and i expect it to be in do so it also have a taskforce look at the small but risky site she mention i will be look at this very closely and support ofcom in relation to its requirement to act in those circumstance 
 the domestic abuse charity oasis in my constituency have alert i to the appalling situation whereby young woman be be coerce into set up onlyfans account to generate income will the secretary of state outline what step he be take to ensure that the sector can root out coercion and exploitation 
 my hon friend be a champion on these issue oasis a great charity be lucky to have she here in the house of commons as a voice for its work and for the need to make radical change to keep people safe online i can assure she that the situation she describe breach several aspect of law include the need to take down illegal content i will be watch closely as she will and work with she to ensure that the new power and those that be come online be effective and that we adapt to these challenge in future 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 on my safe screen tour to discuss online safety for child student themselves be call for action they talk about brain rot and the subtle but dangerous impact on their mental health their self esteem their world outlook and their time do the secretary of state agree with the liberal democrats that give this public health crisis and the massive profit make by social medium giant such as musk we should look to seek revenue from a digital service tax rather than cut benefit from disabled people and struggle family 
 i can assure the hon lady she will have hear this from my previous answer that we be determined to keep young people safe online online   activity and the service offer to people in this country and around the world be adapt and evolve fast because of the speed of innovation we need a regulatory and legislative landscape that can keep up with that innovation and we need a government who will ensure they be on the side of young people and vulnerable people of any age i can assure she that in this government and this secretary of state they have that 
 what recent progress his department have make on improve digital inclusion in sherwood forest constituency 
 if we be to be a successful digital nation we have to take the whole nation with we we be proud recently to publish our digital inclusion action plan the for year because of precisely that we want to take everybody with we 
 too often in ex mining community such as ollerton and edwinstowe in rural community such as farnsfield and even in hucknall west people struggle to get a phone signal and access to the internet constituent feel that they be leave behind and miss out on the new and upcoming technology that we know improve access to online job education and business opportunity do the minister agree that we need to ensure such community be at the heart of the government ’s digital inclusion ambition so no be leave behind especially those in deprive community 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and her constituency exemplify of the issue we face which be that we might have relatively affluent area cheek by jowl with much poor area that be why in our digital inclusion action plan we have try to ensure that we address all the different form of digital exclusion whether it be by virtue of age ethnicity educational background or physical geography 
 lack of access to digital service prevent people from apply for job study and accessing healthcare but community interest company such as donate it base in wincanton be help to bridge the gap by divert it equipment that be otherwise head to landfill by refurbish that tech and distribute it to the people school and group who need it donate it be help to address digital poverty how do the minister plan to support such organisation to prevent electrical waste from go to landfill and to tackle digital exclusion 
 i be really pleased that that be happen in the hon lady ’s constituency we be pleased as a government to be able to say not only that many government departments will make sure that we do precisely the same thing but that many major employer will also do the same it be crazy to chuck old kit into landfill when frankly it could be use much well to provide people with digital opportunity for the future

 under this labour government nhs waiting list be down for month in a row hon member hear hear the hospital of st cross in my constituency of rugby be play its part but many of my constituent remain concerned about long wait in a&e which we inherit from the conservative especially those constituent who have to travel to the general hospital in coventry will the prime minister set out how our plan for change to bring the nhs back into the heart of government will help we to support the frontline and deliver well emergency care close to the community which our constituent have long call for 
 our plan for change have already cut nhs waiting list by almost that have happen for month in a row during the winter month the local trust ’s waiting list in my hon friend ’s area be down and he be do great job for his community we have already deliver extra appointment that we promise because of the record investment in the budget the conservatives can not have it both way if they welcome nhs investment they can not criticise raise the money to pay for it 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 in minute we will hear the chancellor ’s emergency budget even the home secretary ’s husband call it an emergency budget as she scramble to fix the mess she make last october but let we turn to another government minister who be make a mess of her brief the education secretary—[hon member ah why do labour mps vote against ban phone in school last week 
 because it be completely unnecessary i have teenage child almost every school ban phone in school they do it already we need to concentrate on what be really important here which be get to the content that child should not be access i would genuinely like to work across the house on that because there be a huge amount of work to do but the battle be not with school already ban phone the battle an important emerge battle be to work together to ensure that the content that child be access wherever they be be suitable for their age 
 we can look at the content but if the ban be unnecessary why have the government start a review just last week the education secretary describe a ban as a gimmick yet teacher and headteacher say that the evidence already show that school that ban phone get well result the prime minister be wrong not all school do this only in school be smartphone free will he u turn on this 
 we need to ensure that all school do this but the vast majority do it be really important that we focus on the battle we need to have with mobile phone which be the content that child be able to access we need to ensure that that content be control wherever they be it be a question of have the right battle on the right issue not waste time on this when almost all school be already ban mobile phone 
 i be surprised that the prime minister would say that his own government ’s evidence say that phone disrupt nearly half of gcse class every single day discipline be the no issue in many school under the conservatives school become twice as likely to be good or outstanding after go through our behaviour programme so why do the education secretary abolish that programme 
 the right hon lady talk about the record of the last government under their watch a of child start school without appropriate level development such as not be able to use a knife and fork a quarter leave primary school without the require standard of reading writing and math and in child be regularly absent that be why we be push up standard with more information from ofsted transparency for parent and more intervention where school need it 
 the prime minister be not answer the question about discipline in school because he do not care about discipline in school everything he do be ideological and his decision be cost school so much the national insurance hike mean that every state school in the country have to pay more for teacher the education secretary promise to compensate school in full for the job tax why have it not happen 
 it be labour that introduce academy and push up standard this be not ideological i be a parent of teenage child both of whom go to a state school so i be invest in this and it matter hugely to i there be nothing ideological about it that be why we be drive up standard as we always have do 
 the prime minister do not answer the question about compensate school for the job tax which be cost school a lot of money the ceo of the united learning group say that the grant that they be give be short some school will face shortfall of up to can he guarantee that no teacher will lose their job as a result of his job tax 
 it be this government who put a record amount into our school at the budget just as we put a record amount into our nhs and public service which be utterly fail under the last government yet again the right hon lady want all the benefit the nhs but she can not say how she be go to pay for it that be what get we into the mess in the place 
 the whole house will have hear that the prime minister could not guarantee that teacher job be safe not only be he tax school but he be lower standard he talk about our record so i will tell he what our record be under the conservatives english school shoot up the international league table while standard fall at school in labour run wales academy freedom lead to the big improvement of standard in a generation but the education secretary be attack they with her reform can the prime minister point to any evidence at all that these discredit academy reform will improve school standard 
 yes take the example of school go into academy the vast majority of school be already academy therefore we need to think again about what we do about fail school that be already academy we need to go on to the next chapter the conservatives never take the big decision that be why we end up with their record open border which the right hon lady be a cheerleader for a crashed economy mortgage through the roof the nhs on its knee and hollow out armed force what have we get already under this government extra nhs appointment breakfast club include in her constituency record number of people who should not be here be return and a fully fund increase in defence spending that be the difference a labour government make 
 i recently visit harlow college and see the work it be do train the bricklayer and electrician of the future do the prime minister agree that the work of further education college like harlow ’s be vital for the house building that we need for future generation what will his government do to support harlow ’s next generation

 the british drama adolescence have shine a much need spotlight on the enormous damage be do by social medium to the mind of many of our young people especially teenage boy we have argue that social medium giant should be much more toughly regulated and pay more tax so that we can defend our young people from this harm we have have disturbing report that the government be consider scrap the digital service tax and water down britain ’s online safety legislation to appease president trump and his co president elon musk will the prime minister categorically rule out both those thing and make it clear that he will guarantee that british law on tax and social medium will be write in this house and not the white house 
 yes of course as the right hon gentleman well know online safety be important and important new measure be come in the next few month under the act we need to see whether we can go far on this issue because there be concern about whether the measure go far enough but will the law be make in this place of course they will 
 i be grateful for the prime minister ’s reply on the social media law but he do not answer the point on the digital service tax we will come back to that move on after president trump ’s national security adviser accidentally add a journalist to a group chat that be discuss military action in yemen and give all the concern that we share about president trump ’s relationship with vladimir putin and jd vance ’s insult disdain for britain and our armed force will the prime minister order an urgent review into the security of the intelligence that we share with the united states 
 we work with the united states on a daily basis i think that the right hon gentleman would like to think of himself as reasonable and when he be not jump in windermere quite serious but unpick our relation with the us on defence and security be neither responsible nor serious

 every person should have the right to work and we will always protect the most severely disabled and those with lifelong health condition we need to support medina and the other like she who can and want to work that be why we be   invest £ in personalised and tailor employment programme and introduce the right to try work guarantee the conservative party preside over a fail system that do not help they and then blame they we will never do that 
 those who know i well know that i do not talk of this often but for half of my adult life i be physically disabled when i walk through the door of this chamber i do so with a crutch on my right arm to support my body weight i know how it feel right now in scotland some of child live in poverty have a disabled person in their household can the prime minister explain to i actually no can he explain to those child how the labour party make mum and dad poorer will lift they out of poverty

 in england we inherit a fail system that could not be defend but it be also fail in scotland the right hon member focus on young people and young scot that be of they be not in employment education or training that be terrible almost scot be economically inactive due to temporary or long term illness what we be do be take the step to help people into work with £ of employment support the scottish government have record funding under the budget what be they go to do to help the young scot who be be fail by their government 
 the wrexham and flintshire investment zone be of the flagship example of how when the government talk about kick start economic growth they mean it this £ plan will breathe new life into the local economy and create good local job mean that young people in wrexham will be able to find more opportunity on their doorstep will the prime minister join i in welcome this important development for north wales and the potential that it will unlock 
 it be really important that we unleash the economic potential of north wales include by kick start the investment zone which be back by major business like airbus and jcb to leverage £ of private investment invest £ to benefit aerospace worker at broughton where i meet the fantastic young worker and secure £ of investment in shotton mill secure job on deeside we put a record amount of money into the welsh government at the budget a decision that be oppose by plaid 
 for what reason the government have order that the uk ’s shale gas well be permanently seal 
 the right hon member ask about shale gas there be very real economic and environmental consequence to fracke and community have clearly say no 
 i be sorry but that answer have nothing to do with my question which be to ask why the government be order the permanent sealing of britain ’s only shale gas well the government be perfectly entitle on environmental ground not to exploit such well in normal condition but do the prime minister not recognise that take a decision now to concrete these thing over so that a future government can not use they in a desperate situation such as an international conflict where other source of power be cut off from we be an extremely irresponsible and reckless thing to do 
 the right hon member know that there be real consequence of fracke as i have set out what we need to do to secure our independence and the next generation of job and to low bill be move at speed to renewable energy that be why i be pleased that record investment be come into renewable energy so that a tyrant like putin can not put his boot on our throat if the conservative party do not want to support that investment they should say so 
 will the prime minister join i in thank colleague from across the house and the excellent clerks and staff who have spend the last few month work on the terminally ill adult end of life bill committee do he agree that if the law be to change on assist dying it be extremely important to implement that change as soon as it be safe and practicable to do so 
 i congratulate all colleague work on the bill and take part in the debate it be an important issue on which there be different view across the house and within party the bill be a matter for the house but it be the government ’s role to ensure that every piece of legislation that pass through parliament be effective and workable so we will continue to work with my hon friend as the bill ’s promoter to do that in the same way that we do for every private member ’s bill that pass reading if parliament choose to pass the bill the government will implement it in a way that be safe and practicable 
 acorns child ’s hospice provide compassionate care to very young cancer patient and their family across bromsgrove and the village yet it face a staggering £ increase in national insurance contribution as a result of choice make by this government with no exemption for hospice and no uplift in non capital funding this mean that the charity will have to draw on charitable donation make by the public which will affect frontline service this be not right so will the prime minister take this opportunity to right that wrong and exempt hospice from this tax 
 we be invest £ in adult and child ’s hospice to improve facility equipment and accommodation as well as £ in funding   through the child ’s hospice grant interruption conservative members cry and moaning would have a lot more value if they start their question with an apology for crash the economy in the place 
 road in burton and uttoxeter and across staffordshire be litter with pothole local people be fork out thousand because of the conservative neglect and incompetence despite this labour government give tory staffordshire county council £ to get the job do do the prime minister agree that the people of staffordshire deserve well than road with more dimple than a staffordshire oatcake 
 my hon friend be right pothole be a real nuisance if somebody be use their car or van for work and they hit a pothole they be look at a bill of several pound which for many work family be unbudgete for that be why we be hand the west midlands combine authority an additional £ to help repair its road as part of a record £ invest across the country on top of that every council must now publish how many pothole it have fill so that we can show that we be make progress and deliver something that do not happen under the last government

 this be a really important issue and labour in scotland have be clear that it would separate that role that be the right thing to do for the reason that have just be articulate it be the obvious thing to do and obviously it be what we do in england and wales there have be call for a review of this issue since but the snp have not act fast on those call it really do need to bring forward proposal now to deal with this problem which have be sit there for a very long time

 as i set out at the budget last year i be today return to the house to provide an update on our public finance support by a new forecast from the independent office for budget responsibility ahead of a full spending review in june i will then return to the house in the autumn to deliver a budget in line with our commitment to deliver just major fiscal event a year 
 let i now turn to the obr ’s forecast i want to thank richard hughes and his team for their dedicated work the increase global uncertainty have have consequence on our public finance and secondly on our economy i will take each in turn 
 in the autumn i set out our new fiscal rule that would guide this government these fiscal rule be non negotiable they be the embodiment of this government ’s unwavere commitment to bring stability to our economy and to ensure security for work people because the british people have see what happen when a government borrow beyond their mean the mini budget deliver by the conservatives result in high bill high rent and high mortgage and it be not the wealthy who suffer most when they crash the economy it be ordinary work people they continue to feel the effect and a half year later of the damage that the conservatives do 
 let i be clear there be nothing progressive there be nothing labour about work people pay the price for economic irresponsibility the british people put their trust in this labour government because they know that we they know that i would never take   risk with the public finance and would never do anything to put household finance in danger we must earn that trust every single day 
 i set out rule at the budget the be our stability rule which ensure that public spending be under control balance the current budget by so that day to day spending be meet by tax receipt the be our investment rule to drive growth in the economy ensure that net financial debt fall by the end of the forecast period while enable we to invest alongside business 
 turn to the stability rule the obr ’s forecast show that before the step that i will take in this statement the current budget would have be in deficit by £ in have be project to be in surplus by £ in the autumn as the uk alongside our international peer like france and germany have see the cost of borrow rise during this period of heighten uncertainty in global market as a result of the step that i be take today i can confirm that i have restore in full our headroom against the stability rule move from a deficit of £ in and £ in to a surplus of £ in £ in and £ in that compare with the headroom leave by the previous government of just £ that mean that we be continue to meet the stability rule year early build resilience to shock in this a more uncertain world 
 the obr forecast that the investment rule would also be meet year early with net financial debt of of gdp in and in before fall to in to in and then to in provide headroom of £ in the final year of the forecast broadly unchanged from the autumn forecast 
 after the last government double the national debt—[interruption after they double the national debt debt interest payment now stand at £ this year that be more than we allocate to defence the home office and the ministry of justice combine that be the legacy of the conservative party the responsible choice be to reduce our level of debt and borrowing in the year ahead so that we can spend more on the priority of work people and that be exactly what this government will do i say that our fiscal rule be non negotiable and i mean it i will always deliver economic stability and i will always put work people i say it at the election i say it at the budget and i say it again today 
 let i now set out the step that the government have take at the budget we protect work people by keep our promise not to raise their rate of national insurance income tax or vat at the same time we begin to rebuild our public service after the conservatives leave a £ black hole in our public finance our be the right choice the right choice for stability and the right choice for renewal fund by the decision that we take on tax 
 as i promise in the autumn this statement do not contain any further tax increase but when work people be pay their taxis while still struggle with the cost of living it can not be right that other be still evade what they rightly owe in tax in the budget i deliver the most ambitious package of measure   we have ever see to cut down on tax evasion raise   £ per year by the end of the forecast today i go far continue our investment in cut edge technology invest in hmrc ’s capacity to crack down on tax avoidance and set out plan to increase the number of tax fraudster charge every year by these change raise a furth £ take the total revenue raise from reduce tax evasion under this labour government to £ these figure be verify by the office for budget responsibility and i to thank my hon friend the exchequer secretary for his continued work in this area 
 last week my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions set out this government ’s plan to reform the welfare system the labour party be the party of work we believe that if you can work you should work but if you can not work you should be properly support this government inherit a broken system more than people every day be qualify for personal independence payment in young people be not in employment education or training if we do nothing we be write off an entire generation that can not be right and we will not stand for it it be a waste of their potential and it be a waste of their future and we will change it 
 as my right hon friend say in her statement last week the final costing will be subject to the obr ’s assessment today the obr have say that it estimate that the package will save £ in the welfare budget reflect its judgment on behavioural effect and wide factor this also reflect final adjustment to the overall package consistent with the secretary of state ’s statement last week and the government ’s pathway to work green paper the universal credit standard allowance will increase from £ per week in to £ per week by while the universal credit health element will be cut for new claimant by around and then frozen 
 on top of that we be invest £ to provide guarantee personalised employment support to help people back into work and £ to support the department for work and pensions and our jobcentre to deliver these change effectively and fairly take total saving from the package to £ while spend on disability and sickness benefit will continue to rise these plan mean that welfare spending as a share of gdp will fall between and the end of the forecast period which be very different from what we inherit from the conservative party we be reform our welfare system make it more sustainable protect the most vulnerable and most importantly support more people back into secure work and lift they out of poverty 
 at the budget i fix the foundation of our economy to deliver on the promise of change that work have already begin there be some extra appointment in our nhs waiting list be down new breakfast club be open across england there have be the large settlement in real term for scotland wales and northern ireland in the history of devolution and asylum cost be fall promise make and promise keep and every single of they be oppose by opposition party 
 at the budget alongside provide an increase in funding for this year and next i set the envelope for the spending review which we will deliver in june lead by the chief secretary to the treasury that will set departmental budget until for day to day spending and until for capital spending 
 today ’s statement reflect step that we have take on our spending plan because we be live in an uncertain world as the prime minister have set out we will increase defence spending to of gdp and reduce overseas aid to of gross national income that mean that we save £ in day to day spending in to fund our more capital intensive defence commitment secondly in recent month we have begin to fundamentally reform the british state drive efficiency and productivity across government to deliver tangible saving and improve service across our country 
 early this month the prime minister set out our plan to abolish the arm ’s length body nhs england and to ensure that money go directly to improve the service for patient the secretary of state for health and social care be drive forward vital reform to increase nhs productivity and be bear down on costly agency spend to save money so that we can improve patient care 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster be take forward work to reduce the cost of run government significantly by that will be worth £ by the end of the decade this work show that we can make our state lean and more agile and deliver more resource to the frontline while ensure that we control day to day spending to meet our fiscal rule 
 today i build on that work by bring forward £ of investment to deliver the reform that our public service need through a new transformation fund that be money bring forward now to bring down the cost of run government by the end of the forecast period by make public service more efficient more productive and more focused on the user i can confirm today the allocation from this fund include funding for voluntary exit scheme to reduce the size of the civil service and for pioneer artificial intelligence tool to modernise the state investment in technology for the ministry of justice to deliver probation service more effectively and up front investment so that we can support more child in foster care to give they the good possible start in life and reduce cost pressure in the future 
 our work to make government lean more productive and more efficient will help deliver a furth £ of day to day saving by overall day to day spending will be reduce by £ by and it will now grow by an average of a year above inflation for comparison in the autumn that figure be i can confirm to the house that day to day spending will increase in real term above inflation in every single year of the forecast in the spending review apart from the reduction in overseas aid day to day spending across government have be fully protect 
 i can also confirm our approach to capital investment in the autumn budget i announce £ of additional capital spending to crowd in investment   from the private sector in order to fix our crumble infrastructure and create job in every corner of our country today i be not cut capital spending as   the conservative party do time and again because that choke off growth and leave our school roof literally crumble that be the wrong choice it be the irresponsible choice it be the tory choice today i be instead increase capital spending by an average of £ per year compare with in the autumn to drive growth in our economy and to deliver in full our vital commitment on defence this government will ensure that every pound we spend will deliver for the british people by increase productivity drive growth in our economy and improve our frontline public service 
 let i turn to the impact of increase uncertainty on our economy to deliver economic stability we must work closely with the bank of england support the independent monetary policy committee to meet the inflation target there have be interest rate cut since the general election and today ’s data show that inflation fall in february have peak at under the previous government the office for budget responsibility forecast that consumer price index inflation will average this year before fall rapidly to in and meet the target from onwards give family and business the security that they need and provide our economy with the stable platform that it need to grow

 as the previous government learn to their detriment there be no shortcuts to economic growth it will take long term decision it will take our putting in the hard yard it will take time for the effect of the reform that we be introduce to be feel in the everyday economy it be right that the office for budget responsibility should consider the evidence and look carefully at measure before recognise a growth impact in its forecast but i can announce to the house that the obr have consider and have score of the central plank of our plan for growth

 this be not just about line on a graph it be about improve people ’s life work people be still feel the pinch after a cost of living crisis cause by the conservatives that cause interest rate and inflation to go through the roof so i be pleased that the obr confirm today that real household disposable income will now grow this year at almost twice the rate expect in the autumn compare with the forecast in the final budget deliver by the conservatives and after take inflation into account the obr say today that household will be on average more than £ a year well off under this labour government that will mean more money in the pocket of work people and high living standard promise by this labour government deliver by this labour government and oppose by the party opposite 
 the world be change we can see that and we can feel it a change world demand a government who be on the side of work people act in their interest act in the national interest not retreat from challenge and not step back it demand a government with the courage to step up to secure britain ’s future and to seize the opportunity that be out there and before we i be impatient for change the british people be impatient for change after year of failure and we be begin to see change happen our plan for change be work defence spending be rise waiting list be fall wage be up and interest rate be cut that be the difference that this labour government be make 
 today the obr confirm that our plan to get britain building will drive growth in our economy and put more money in people ’s pocket there be no quick fix but we have take the right choice return stability to our economy after year of mismanagement by the party opposite and deliver security for our country and security for work people that be what drive this government that be what drive i as chancellor and that be what drive the choice i have set out today i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 at the last budget the right hon lady say that she would bring stability to the public finance but this statement more appropriately refer to as an emergency budget have bring she to a cold—[interruption 
 order rightly i want to hear the chancellor and i now want to hear the shadow chancellor interruption i do not need any help 
 this emergency budget have bring the right hon lady to a cold hard reckoning she have become fond recently of talk about the world have change and indeed it have this country be grow at the fast rate in the g7 only about a year ago just as the oecd the bank of england and other forecaster include we learn today the obr have state growth have be halve for this year it have be cut in as a consequence of the decision and the choice that the right hon lady have make on her watch inflation be down to 2%—bang on target under a conservative government on the very day of the last general election we be now tell that this year we will be run at twice the level as be forecast under we in that will mean price bear down on household and on business right across the country because of her choice 
 the obr also say that unemployment will be rise this year next year and the year after in fact across the forecast period it will not decline at all so much for the right hon lady ’ back to work plan we have already see what it mean when it come to control borrowing under this chancellor she have come forward now with a plan to squeeze spending later on in the forecast period and she have of course tell the obr that these be the element of spending restraint to which she will stick but what do the market think give her track record and the fact that she have fail to control spending and borrowing to date what do the right hon lady think the market will make of her late promise
