 a vital part of secure northern ireland ’s place in the union be the share prosperity fund which be about level up and make sure that northern ireland have its fair share funding be due to end next year in march what clarification can the secretary of state give to community voluntary and other group that need to plan ahead and whose funding face a cliff edge if they do not have assurance soon 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend the chairman of the select committee i be wary of give too many assurance because we be talk about a time beyond the next general election when there will be a new conservative government who will have priority that they will wish to update   we know about the success that the share prosperity fund have have in northern ireland i have visit project that it have fund i would like to think that it will continue strongly across the next spending review period 
 on behalf of my colleague may i extend our deep sympathy to the family of frank field he and i share year in the house and i always find he to be a very warm and engaging colleague someone who have time for young parliamentarian like i and who believe very much in this place and our country may i also thank the secretary of state and the minister of state department for business and trade   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for the inclusion of northern ireland in the horizon scandal bill that be incredibly important 
 as a unionist i believe in this country and will work every day to strengthen our place in it we recognise the safeguard the union command paper as an important step stone in maintain and secure our position the secretary of state mention the government ’s commitment to eliminate all routine check in the uk internal market system and we look forward to his faithful delivery of that however while we have see the creation of the east west council we have hear little about the construction of intertrade uk or the establishment of the independent monitoring panel may i ask the secretary of state to update the house on those issue 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question and look forward to work with he in his new role i can assure he that his majesty 's government be work apace and will deliver on our command paper commitment in full include our commitment on check he ask about a range of body and pledge that we have make just last month we hold the inaugural meeting of the east west council which give ministers from the united kingdom government and the northern ireland executive an opportunity to come together to discuss the main priority of the council ’s work programme we be committed to strengthen and safeguard the union through our implementation of that programme and we be committed to safeguard the uk internal market by establish new body such as intertrade uk which will promote and facilitate trade in the united kingdom i will respond to the right hon gentleman ’s other point when time allow 
 the secretary of state will recognise that of the issue absent from the windsor framework and subsequent agreement be the conclusion of an arrangement for veterinary medicine he will know how important agriculture be to the northern ireland economy and he will also know that northern ireland produce time as much food as we need to the benefit of our near neighbour the establishment of the veterinary medicine working group with the help of the minister of state and my hon friend   the member for north antrim ian paisley have be extremely positive but there be a cliff edge towards the end of next year we need a successful conclusion to the issue and i would be grateful if the secretary of state could inform the house that that will happen 
 this matter be very important to the government and for northern ireland the government ’s priority be to secure a long term sustainable solution on veterinary medicine and we wish to pursue such a solution through discussion with the european union and to prepare safeguard for all scenario as the right hon gentleman say we have set up a veterinary medicine working group to advise the government on solution and we be grateful for the expertise of members who be join that group it have meet twice and aim to report in a timely manner in june in the meantime we have put in place a grace period arrangement until the end of which support continuity of supply in northern ireland however the right hon gentleman be right to emphasise the importance of this matter and we be work hard on it 
 what step he be take to help increase gdp in northern ireland 
 the uk government be commit to the long term economic growth of northern ireland and be work closely with the executive and business to demonstrate what a fantastic place it be to live work and invest in for instance we have deliver the northern ireland investment summit we be commit to level up northern ireland ’s economy with £ be spend on city and growth deal we be implement key deliverable in the safeguard the union command paper and we continue to promote northern ireland ’s unique institutional arrangement 
 with the executive restore and enjoy a financial package of more than £ do the minister agree that northern ireland business be now in position for an era of transformational success 
 absolutely and i be grateful to my hon friend for highlight that but funding be of course only part of the solution the transformation of public service be vital but achieve that will require innovative strategic thinking as well as some revenue raising and the government stand ready to assist the northern ireland executive with formal structure to help they achieve those end 
 i thank the minister for his answer we have a massively skilled workforce in northern ireland as everyone here know include the minister however in order to increase investment we must create more skilled job and employ more people in the aerospace sector what discussion have the minister have with cabinet colleague about secure more job in our aerospace community in northern ireland we can do more we just need a bit more help 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question i have visit spirit aerosystems as well as other related company and there be a terrific pool of talent and skill in northern ireland we work with the department for business and trade to ensure that the same advantage be available to people and business in northern ireland as across the rest of the uk i sense that brevity require that i do not elaborate on dbt ’s full offer but it be certainly there i will write to he to set out the detail 
 if he will hold discussion with the northern ireland executive on the long term sustainability of northern ireland 's natural environment 
 the uk government regularly engage with the recently restore northern ireland executive on a range of issue and we will continue to work together for the benefit of northern ireland only yesterday i meet minister muir who be responsible for agriculture environment and rural affair to discuss the implication of the windsor framework and to work through how i can help he to succeed across his full spectrum of responsibility 
 i thank the minister for his positive response he will be aware of the ecological disaster at lough neagh which supply of northern ireland ’s drinking water it be partly cause by the run off of agricultural fertiliser climate change and the spread of the invasive zebra mussel but have be exacerbate by sewage dumping can he say a bit more about this issue in the past i have find that his department and the department for environment food and rural affairs have not be willing to work with stormont to address environmental issue in northern ireland what can he do to address they 
 i have stand on the shore of lough neagh and be conscious of the condition of that enormous body of water which be beautiful the reality be that the responsibility for it be devolve and we do not have an executive for a period we be absolutely delighted that it be back and be carry forward in a constructive spirit as i say i will continue to work with minister muir i do not want to tread on his toe but we will put ourselves at his disposal to offer whatever help we reasonably can he be a minister of great dedication and energy and i look forward to he succeed on this urgent matter 
 do my right hon friend agree that frank field leave an immense legacy in the field of pension he start off as chair of the all party parliamentary group on the maxwell pensioner problem and be then an inspired minister of state he be subsequently involve in all the great debate we have on pension we will miss he 
 what impact do the minister think that nature base solution to climate change could have on the sort of problem in northern ireland that we have be discuss 
 i be most grateful to my right hon and learn friend for his question and i agree with he on the pension point on nature base solution i would love to have that conversation with he perhaps in the tea room it be not my specialist area of expertise and i be confident that minister muir would be interested to hear my right hon and learn friend ’s idea if he wish to share they with i i will gladly pass they on 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the restoration of devolved government on northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the restoration of the northern ireland assembly on northern ireland 
 i be sure that my hon friend will welcome the fact that once again northern ireland have local politician take decision in a local assembly that be accountable to local people with a funding package worth over £ the executive be take forward the vital work of public service transformation and deliver sustainable finance and be ensure well outcome for the people of northern ireland in their daily life the impact of all this have be unbelievably positive 
 the commitment that this government and my right hon friend have show in push for the restoration of the northern ireland executive be clearly demonstrate in the £   for transform public service but what help be the home civil service provide to their colleague in northern ireland to make sure that people there have the modern and efficient public service that they deserve and how will that benefit all nation 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i agree that there be a fantastic opportunity which we be try to take for the uk government to collaborate with and support the northern ireland executive in transform public service the uk government have high hope that ministers in the executive will move quickly to deliver on their commitment to set up a transformation board and we be excited to work with northern ireland ministers to produce plan that will deliver transformation for northern ireland indeed i meet the minister and deputy minister last week we talk about this work and how we can further it in the very short term 
 do the secretary of state agree that the restoration of the northern ireland assembly provide the stability for further private investment in northern ireland this be a massive opportunity it be the miss piece in the puzzle and could make a huge difference how do he intend to capitalise on this 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the restoration of devolved government not only provide certainty and stability for business but allow we to harness our combine energy and expertise to make northern ireland a fantastic place to live work and invest my right hon friend the minister of state have remind the house of the success of the northern ireland investment summit last september which welcome business investor from around the world and of our £ investment in northern ireland ’s city and growth deal recently i visit washington dc with the minister and deputy minister and it be fair to say that the us business community be now well aware of the amazing opportunity in northern ireland and be look at they hungrily 
 the return of devolution have to be build on particularly as there be still some issue to be resolve while some in northern ireland concentrate on complain about the outstanding problem there be those of we who be committed to resolve they the secretary of state be in a well position than most to help to resolve they will he recommit today to our see further move in the come week in the direction of resolve all the outstanding issue 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on his recent honour for his many year of elect public service in this place and to his constituent yes he absolutely can have that commitment from i i be committed to deliver at great pace on all the pledge we make in the command paper and i be absolutely committed to deliver the good outcome for everyone across northern ireland because that be what northern ireland deserve 
 of course the restoration of devolved government in northern ireland be very welcome the minister will be aware that polling evidence have show a big growth since the good friday agreement in the number of people who identify as northern irish as distinct from irish or british what implication do that have for the way that devolve government conduct itself go forward 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question because there be a genuinely interesting point about the growth in the number of people who live in northern ireland who declare themselves to be northern irish i would like to think that it be reflect in the way that the minister and the deputy minister go about their business they be work together in a respectful and positive way respectful of each other ’s community and want the good for the place they represent i believe that signify a healthy development for the future of northern ireland politic 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr. speaker for your eloquent tribute to frank field he be a brave and a generous man 
 we look forward to work with   the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson   in his new position 
 the uk ’s successful bid to host the euros with ireland be a fantastic opportunity for northern ireland but with just year leave to build the casement park stadium the executive have yet to invite tender in may last year the secretary of state be ask who would provide the money and he reply 
 all partner i guarantee it 
 give that the clock be tick how and when do the right hon gentleman intend with other to honour that guarantee so that the stadium get build on time 
 the right hon gentleman know that he be ask that question of someone who have be a football referee for the last year and who be rather passionate about the game i really want to see these euro game play at casement park and i have   make that clear but the late cost that i have see be significantly high than the one i see a year ago and any taxpayer contribution to the casement park project will need to be make on a value for money basis i have also say many time that there be no blank cheque here especially when there be no contractor appoint yet we do not want to artificially inflate a price the northern ireland executive will also need to decide on whether and how they will underwrite any future increase in cost as i say back then all partner be work together to try to work out what the number be and how we can deliver on it 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for that reply 
 other challenge that the institution face be deal with the continue legacy of the trouble day from now all civil case and inquest relate to the trouble will come to an end under the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which be widely oppose in northern ireland do the right hon gentleman think that confidence in the new independent commission will be help or hinder by the fact that it have recently bring separate legal challenge to the disclosure by coroner of information to family about what happen to their love one information that they have be deny for so many year 
 the right hon gentleman conflate issue there be the ongoing element of how we deal with public interest immunity and the neither confirm nor deny policy in court case in northern ireland and indeed across the united kingdom secondly there be the question about the new commission we be set up to deal with legacy i believe that even those with civil case will be able to use the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery in good faith when it open its door on   may 
 only this month the former co chair of the consultative group on the past denis bradley say that he think the people involve with the icrir 
 be very good people i have a lot of regard for they and if people decide it offer they something well then i will be very reluctant to make too many strong judgment around it because 
 this be the problem that the uk government be try to solve 
 we have create a swamp around legacy a complete swamp anything that help some people to get out of that swamp i will not be too critical 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i add my party ’s tribute to frank field we send our condolence to his friend and family he be birkenhead ’s mp for year and he be a very faithful servant not only to his constituent but to this place 
 the return of devolved government to northern ireland have be rightly welcome across this house will the secretary of state reaffirm his government ’s commitment to the principle of consent not just in northern ireland but in scotland and wales the people of those place should be able to choose the form of government well suit to their need whether that happen to be inside or outside the united kingdom 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s welcoming of the restore institution i be also a great respecter of referendum result and i believe we have in scotland that be probably enough say 
 what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the expansion of integrated education in northern ireland 
 the government remain committed to support integrate education in northern ireland and have already make fund available to support more school than ever to convert to integrated status i and my noble friend lord caine look forward to engage with the new education minister paul givan to make progress on this important issue 
 i travel with colleague to northern ireland week ago and we visit forge integrated primary school and meet lot of very fine child in £ of fresh start funding be earmark for integrated education in northern ireland what do the minister say to those school that be expect this funding but have find that it be no long guarantee 
 the house may not know that only of schoolchildren in northern ireland can be say to be attend an integrated school which we would like to see change the period over which fresh start funding be release would have end at the end of march so we have repurpose £ of that funding to provide additional flexibility to the northern ireland executive in respect of that funding stream and school 
 we be determined to see more parent give the opportunity to choose integrated education for their child as a vital part of the process of reconciliation i for be especially committed to it as someone who proudly attend a baptist church where for many year i worship with a roman catholic lady and have no idea we should help northern ireland move to a point where denomination be a small matter and where people move forward together 
 an important item in the in tray of the newly re formed executive be early year education and childcare thank to the action of this government we now have more generous entitlement to free childcare in england and northern ireland will he discuss with the executive how northern ireland might be level up on childcare include by use revenue raise measure 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue and i be grateful to she for put it on the agenda certainly we will engage with the executive on this point she be right to mention revenue raising it be a fact that the executive need to both transform public service and improve revenue raising so that everything in northern ireland can be deliver on a sustainable basis 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i also recently visit the forge integrated primary school in belfast i see their much need and develop plan to replace their portacabin with building answer their need for extra capacity the school be disappoint that the plan have be shelve along with project at other integrated school education be devolve but money have be earmark for such project by the uk government under the fresh start agreement do the secretary of state understand why teacher pupil and parent be so disappointed that those plan have be shelve do he have any plan to restore they 
 i hear the hon lady my right hon friend the secretary of state and i understand people ’s concern and we too have visit school i certainly have and i think my right hon friend have too 
 indicate assent 
 i repeat that we have repurpose the money so that it can endure and be available to the executive to be use for purpose as they decide if we have not repurpose it the money would have expire at the end of march next year i be proud that we have take the step necessary with the treasury to enable that money to continue to be available to the executive it be for they to decide how to spend it but we continue to be fully commit to integrated education 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the development of a programme for government 
 i meet the minister and the deputy minister last week we have a constructive discussion about the executive ’s priority 
 the public ’s relief at the restoration of the assembly have give way to frustration at the lack of pace of delivery by the executive after a year void they be say they do not want to be hurry to deliver for the people of northern ireland pressed healthcare staff people wait for special educational need service and those watch lough neagh face another summer of algal bloom be very much in a hurry for action northern ireland urgently need a delivery plan a programme for government and a budget yes resource be a part of that so will the minister update we on any negotiation on the fiscal framework will he impress on the executive the need for urgent action not just warm word 
 thing that i pick up from the minister and the deputy minister last week be that they too want to act in all the way the hon lady say their priority include develop a programme for government that will enable they to take forward the vital work of public service transformation they be only week in and i look forward to good result in the short medium and long term 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i wish to welcome our special guest who be observe our proceeding today his excellency johari abdul speaker of the house of representatives of malaysia your excellency you be most welcome 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday april 
 mr speaker i have be ask to reply i know that member across the house will wish to join i in offer condolence to the family and friend of lord frank field he be an outstanding parliamentarian who work tirelessly to make society a well place 
 my right hon friend the prime minister be in berlin he have announce the big strengthening of our defence in a generation 
 i be sure that member will want to join i in wish the jewish community a happy passover a celebration of freedom of course we remember the empty chair of those hostage still be hold captive in gaza and call for their immediate release 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in the house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i too wish to pass on my thought and prayer to lord field ’s family friend and colleague and particularly to student and teacher at the birches head academy in stoke on trent who be part of the frank field education trust 
 since be elect in i have help to reopen tunstall town hall with a new library and family hub secure funding for additional cctv new alley gate and well lighting in tunstall to ensure that our street be safe and help to breathe new life into tunstall ’s old library and bath thank to this government ’s levelling up fund of £ to stoke on trent 
 sadly labour lead stoke on trent city council seek to undermine that progress by introduce a brand new tax on resident to have their garden waste collect refuse to take planning enforcement against rogue and absent landlord who plague tunstall high street and increase crime and antisocial behaviour by dump undesirable people in the centre of tunstall do the deputy prime minister agree that stoke on trent labour—[interruption 
 order it be normally mr gullis who be loud please let i hear he 
 this just go to show the disdain that the labour party have for stoke on trent 
 do the deputy prime minister agree that it be time for stoke on trent labour to axe the garden tax to take the fight to lousy landlord 
 order there be a question to be ask and a time in which we ask it i suggest that the hon member put in for an adjournment debate i be sure that he have the answer 
 mr speaker there be not much that i can add to that laughter the hon member have as ever prove what an excellent campaigner he be for his constituent he highlight the same problem with labour council across the country raise taxis and let service fall into disrepair of course he be totally right to be hold rogue landlord to account 
 i call the deputy leader of the opposition 
 may i share the deputy prime minister ’s comment regard our jewish community and wish they a happy passover i wish to acknowledge the loss of david marquand and baroness massey both of whom make historic contribution in parliament politic and wide life i also send my condolence follow today ’s news to the family of lord frank field who be a good friend of mine and a colleague he be a tireless campaigner against poverty and a champion for his constituent 
 mr speaker i know that the conservative party be desperate to talk about my live arrangement but the public want to know what this government will do about theirs natalie from brighton have be serve with no fault eviction notice in month she join nearly a family at risk of homelessness due to the deputy prime minister ’s failure to ban this cruel practice instead of obsess over my house when will he get a grip and show the same obsession with end no fault eviction 
 to begin with it be a pleasure to have another exchange with the right hon lady in this house our in month any more of these and she will be claim it as her principal residence 
 on the issue of no fault eviction it may have escape the right hon lady ’s attention but we will be vote on exactly that matter later today this be the conservative government take action 
 the deputy prime minister clearly think that he could spend all week obsess over my live arrangement and do not even bother to read up on his own government ’s bill this afternoon the reality be that he cave in to vested interest on his back benches and delay justice for people like natalie this week the housing minister say that there be no solid date for ban no fault eviction the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities now say that it will not happen before an election if the deputy prime minister can give we a date will he name it now 
 i can name the date for the right hon lady today it be today that the house will vote on it and i be confident that in line with our manifesto we will deliver on that commitment 
 the deputy prime minister clearly have not be look up his own government bills let i turn to another tory housing failure leasehold be a rip off and a con but the government ’s propose ban on new leasehold apply only to house the majority of leasehold be in flat what be the point of a ban on new leasehold if it will not apply to flat 
 again the right hon lady be talk about legislation introduce by this government that the labour party totally fail to introduce in its entire time in office it be no surprise because it be this government who have bring social housing waiting list down by nearly half a and deliver more affordable home in the last year than labour deliver when it be in office of course all this can only be pay for by ensure that we have a strong economy her policy to repeal every single conservative trade union law in the day would open the door to french style wildcat strike sweep away the reform that make this country great we all know though the reform by margaret thatcher that the right hon lady would not abolish the right to buy your council house 
 i be expect a little bit well from the deputy prime minister he seem to be a bit wear out maybe it be the am call from the bad man that have be keep he up at night he talk about strike and the union we have have more strike under this government ’s watch than at any time before once again he have not read his own bill their ban on leasehold will not apply to the majority of people it be like ban non dom but exempt tory prime ministers he speak about affordable home family be trap in temporary accommodation and stick on waiting list and in the west midland the conservative mayor have use his multi pound housing budget to build just social home in year that be   almost as many as in the chancellor ’s property portfolio the british people know that the conservative party will not build the home that this country need so   when will they get a chance to vote for a government who will 
 i be surprised that the right hon lady raise the west midland when labour control birmingham have virtually bankrupt the council and be hike up council tax by while in the meantime i be sure that this would please she continue to hand out £ to the trade union by contrast andy street our brilliant mayor of the wide west midland have deliver £ of investment to improve transport there you have it the contrast between the conservative party and the labour party and the usual political opportunism from she fail to ask about the issue that really matter if you want more bin collection more pothole fill low debt and low council tax vote conservative because whether it be ben houchen in the tees valley or andy street in the west midland it be only the conservative mayors who deliver more for less 
 it be pretty revealing that the deputy prime minister think that housing be not an issue for the british people i think it really be people in glass house should not throw stone because in birmingham and across the whole country council be face black hole because of his government ’s austerity programme i warn the deputy prime minister that tory council have also face section notice and birmingham city council have have over £ take from its budget from some of the poor people more than family face lose their home after the tory party ’s mini budget and mortgage bill continue to   soar meanwhile the former prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss parade around the world in a twisted victory lap promote her new book say that the mini budget be her proud moment since she will not apologise to those family lose their home will he 
 what the prime minister have do since he have take office with the chancellor be to restore stability to our economy with inflation halve and more down to as a result of that in an increasingly dangerous world the prime minister be able to announce his plan for the big strengthening of defence spending in a generation but it should come as no surprise that the labour party refuse to say whether it back that because this come from the right hon lady who vote to scrap trident and to install in downing street someone who want to change the army into a peace corps there you have it 
 the right hon gentleman talk about defence we all want to see the difference be that we have not cut the army to its small size since napoleon never mind some secretive deep state it be the state of the tory party that be the problem the tories be in a deep state of sewage after year they have fail renter they have fail leaseholder and they have fail mortgage holder i read with interest that the right hon gentleman have be urge his neighbour in no to call an election because he be worried they might get wipe out have he finally realise that when he stab boris johnson in the back to get his mate into no he be ditch their big election winner for a pint sized loser 
 i think the whole house will have hear despite all the bluster from the right hon lady not a single word on whether she would actually back our plan to invest in our armed force no plan in a dangerous world of course as ever the deputy labour leader be always look to attack other failure but never to take responsibility for her own she once say you should not be wait for the police to bang on your door if you do it then you should not be do your job the right hon landlady should forget her tax advice and follow her own advice 
 level up which my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis mention early be absolutely on fire in the calder valley with £ for hospital reconfiguration £ for flood defence no few than school be remodelled or rebuild as we speak £ for the regeneration of town centre and elland get a new railway station do my right hon friend agree that the naysayer around level up need look no far than the calder valley to see the great achievement of this government 
 my right hon friend be right it be not just in the calder valley but in community up and down the country the government be invest billion in infrastructure across the united kingdom create job and opportunity in every region i know that he have be a staunch advocate for the calder valley which be a fantastic example of that in action 
 i call the deputy leader of the scottish national party 
 i join in wish the jewish community a happy passover and send my condolence to the family and love one of frank field 
 year ago when mass graf be discover in ukraine this house unite in condemnation and rightly treat those graf as evidence of war crime which russia must be make to answer for yesterday palestinian official uncover mass graf outside the bomb hospital in gaza those graf also constitute a war crime do they not 
 of course we would expect the democratic government of israel to investigate any allegation of misconduct that be exactly what they be do and it be exactly what the foreign secretary and the prime minister urge they to do however i find it quite extraordinary that the hon lady seek to draw parallel between the legitimate war of self defence of israel and the conduct of russia 
 body include of the elderly and the injure some of which have be strip naked and mutilate with their hand tie behind their back the uk ’s own arm policy state that if there be even a risk that war crime may be take place that be reason enough to halt the sale of arm give all that we know why be the prime minister yet to do so 
 we continue to urge the israeli government to investigate any allegation of misconduct the difference though be that we can trust the israeli government a democratically elect government to properly investigate those thing of course we keep the advice under review the foreign secretary have recently make it clear that he have conduct a determination and have not change his advice regard export licence and i think that be the correct decision 
 the good people of lincoln who all declare their taxis and pay tax on profit when sell their home overwhelmingly want lincoln christmas market to be bring back after the labour run city council cruelly close it last year the labour city council have refuse to do what the people of lincoln want what message do the deputy prime minister send to the voter of lincoln before next week ’s local election 
 i be afraid that what my hon friend have describe be the grinch in action that christmas market in the home of magna carta be belove by local resident but the council have totally ignore their wish and cancel it it should reverse that decision

 unpaid carer have share heartbreaking story of how they have be hound by the department for work and pensions and tell to pay huge fine for minor infringement of carer ’s allowance earn rule all because the government have fail to do anything   about a problem that they have know about for year yesterday of the prime minister ’s own dementia adviser resign say that the government ’s treatment of those unpaid carer be beyond the pale will the deputy prime minister apologise to all unpaid carer who have be fail by his government and will he commit to a full review of the system 
 i pay tribute to all unpaid carer indeed i meet some of they over the weekend and know how hard they work they keep our society function through their commitment to we that be why we have uprate the benefit by £ a week and have increase the carer ’s allowance by almost £ since in respect of allegation of overpayment of course appropriate discretion should be show but if there have be erroneous overpayment it be right on behalf of the taxpayer to be able to recuperate they however we will work with anyone who be struggle with those repayment to negotiate sustainable and affordable repayment plan 
 my island constituency of ynys môn be access via bridge the menai suspension bridge and the britannia bridge holyhead be the busy port in the uk but bridge repair and the weather can result in long traffic queue to make the most of our anglesey freeport and new nuclear at wylfa a crossing be vital last year the welsh labour government scrap plan for all new road project include our bridge will the deputy prime minister use his influence to ensure that north wales be not ignore by cardiff and that we get that bridge

 the conservative candidate for london mayor have promote islamophobic trope online endorse the belief of enoch powell and claim that the black community have a problem with crime in the week when we mark the anniversary of the murder of stephen lawrence do the deputy prime minister really endorse those view 
 i think the hon lady know that she do not correctly represent the view of the candidate i find it extraordinary that she have raise the issue of crime because while labour ’s london mayor have increase the precept by over record crime in london have increase by that be the record of the labour london mayor no wonder people will be vote against he

 the hon gentleman talk about teesside taxpayer but ben houchen have never impose a mayoral precept in tees valley full stop at the same time he have save teesside airport and secure a new freeport for teesside no wonder people will be vote for he again 
 have my right hon friend see the video that be do the round of the theft in a shop in my constituency boots the chemist on station road in the space of minute threaten individual rob thousand of pound out of that shop and they be not alone it be happen again and again in fact of my team go out and photograph they leave brazenly not care and even spit at the police will my right hon friend please now say to the home secretary and through he to the police that this be not a petty crime this be a threat of violence and massive robbery and it should be a priority for the police we always talk about more police surely what we should be ask for be more effective policing that get those criminal off the street 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight this issue often the allegedly low level crime be the one that have the big impact on community i know that my right hon friend the home secretary have be very clear on that point and i will make it to he again that be also why we be roll out a range of crime prevention measure through the safe street fund it be why we be improve cctv and street lighting and it be why we introduce the police crime sentencing and courts act to give the police great power to deliver tough sentence for more serious offender 
 early the deputy prime minister say that when the prime minister and the chancellor take office they restore stability to the uk economy who do he think cause the instability 
 labour members might want to forget it but i remember the day the conservatives come into office in what be the note leave on the desk of the chief secretary to the treasury there be no money leave that be the challenge that we have address through the prime minister and chancellor successively 
 labour ’s mayoral candidate in the west midlands talk about housing but make no commitment to protect our precious green belt he talk about transport but he fail to commit to reopen aldridge train station he commit to save police station such as aldridge then when the labour police and crime commissioner say he would close they he change his mind and agree to that so we be leave wonder in my constituency what he stand for do my right hon friend agree with i that only mayor andy street have a plan and a track record to be trust to deliver for the west midlands 
 as ever my right hon friend be absolutely correct to highlight the record of labour ’s police and crime commissioner and west midlands police have actually be put in special measure on simon foster ’s watch when it come to the green belt we have all see the new wheeze from the labour party redesignate green belt grey belt and concrete all over it well the conservatives will not allow that to happen and people up and down the country will vote conservative to stop that happen 
 conservative ministers like to blame strike and the pandemic for the appalling waiting time in the nhs the blackpool teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust have not hit its target for see patient in a&e within hour since before the strike and before the pandemic but year after the conservatives come to office so who do the deputy prime minister blame for that 
 labour member like to pretend the pandemic do not happen and they like—[interruption that be the cause of the big pressure on the nhs they complain about nhs performance while back strike by doctor who unreasonably want a pay rise despite all of those pressure actually a&e performance have improve in the past month 
 the labour leader of the almost bankrupt hastings borough council and several other labour councillor resign from the labour party cite that the national labour party have become overly authoritarian in a dereliction of local democracy and have lose its moral compass and be suffocate local voice because its only objective be power for power ’s sake would the deputy prime minister agree that vote for conservative candidate in upcoming election will ensure local voter be hear local democracy be uphold and well service be deliver 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the really serious concern about labour councillor in hastings former labour councillor say that labour be no long provide 
 the policy the support or the focus on local government 
 i could not have put it well myself 
 with thousand of steelworker job on the line the likelihood of industrial action and report of a deal for india to be exempt from carbon taxis will this government now back the detailed serious and robust multi union proposal as the only way to keep primary steel making in the uk 
 the government will engage with any proposal that have be bring forward as we always do but it be actually the case that we have already provide over £ in energy cost relief to the steel sector in the past year it be also the case that even in the past year the government spend £ more on uk make steel for major public project so we be continue to work with the steel industry but we have already provide tremendous support 
 i very much associate myself with the remark of my right hon friend regard lord frank field who be a good man 
 i very much welcome the government ’s firm commitment to increase defence spending to by it be something that will send the right message to our ally and potential adversary alike and it be something on which the defence committee have be campaign for a little while however would my right hon friend do what he can to ensure that some of that increase money be spend on additional recruitment include if necessary increase wage sufficiently to ensure that the navy can manage ship the air force can maintain its aircraft and the army can dominate ground 
 i know what a staunch advocate my hon friend be for the armed force and for fund the armed force all of we can take great pride that we be put the resource in to meet the challenge that the nation be likely to face over the next year we will be work through the allocation of that but it be already the case that in january we have the large ever number of application in recent year to join the armed force so we be make progress on that 
 my constituent lisa care for her mother she work part time at whsmith and be sure to keep the department for work and pensions inform so that she would not be overpay carer ’s allowance however because of a dwp blunder she now face a bill for £ the secretary of state for science innovation and technology care for her career she work part time as a woke detector however when she blunder call a top scientist a hamas supporter the bill ten of thousand of pound in cost and damage be pick up by taxpayer like lisa why 
 it be this government who have uprated benefit for carer with almost £ more i think it be the case that the hon lady ’s constituent my constituent and people up and down the country would expect the government to seek to recover overpay sum we need to do that in a compassionate way and if people be struggle to make repayment the dwp will engage to ensure that they have a sustainable and affordable way to make those repayment 
 may i associate myself with the tribute and condolence pay to the late great frank field of his last achievement in the world of education be the holiday activity and food fund which this government can take great pride in have fund may i urge my right hon friend to use his good office across government to ensure that we secure a multi year settlement for the continuance of that vital work 
 i know what an important piece of work this be and i know my hon friend ’s commitment to campaign for it we have already provide substantial sum and i be sure we will continue to do so 
 as the chair of the scottish arm of feeding britain may i thank you mr speaker and those on the front benches for their tribute to the great frank field he chair an all party parliamentary inquiry year ago on food poverty and food bank use have increase relentlessly since then will the government consider in frank field ’s memory a cross sector summit with the aim of help community to secure the resource to deliver food security programme at the necessary scale 
 i join the hon gentleman in pay tribute to lord frank field ’s campaigning it be the case that over the past couple of year we have provide more than £ worth of support with the cost of living include extra cost of live payment of £ last year the effect of all that be that few people be live in absolute poverty than when the conservatives come to office 
 last week we have the finance bill and in it i notice a reduction in capital gain tax from to on residential property to try to turbo boost the residential market will that apply retrospectively so that hypothetically if a labour front bencher owe capital gain tax they would benefit from this conservative tax cut 
 i have always believe in have low taxis that everyone pay 
 this week mark the lesbian visibility week found by my good friend and publisher of   magazine linda riley it come at a time when lgbtqia woman be be let down by this government and nowhere more so than in their failure to remove the financial burden that same sex couple face when access ivf my constituent holly and leanne like so many other have be price out of have a family so will the deputy prime minister commit to finally end this gay tax for same sex couple who want to start a family 
 i would dispute the hon lady ’s characterisation of the government ’s record in this area it be this government who introduce marriage for same sex couple and pass the ture law she   raise an important point that i be happy to take up the health secretary but the overall record of this government be an excellent 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement update the house on the government ’s commitment to increase defence spending to this decade 
 in my speech at lancaster house in january i warn that we be enter a much more dangerous period in the world and i make the case for a national conversation about defence spending since then putin have step up his attack on ukraine china be increasingly assertive and tension have escalate in the middle east culminate in iran ’s unprecedented attack on israel day ago conduct in parallel with the proxy iran have nourish around israel ’s border in the middle east include of course the houthis who continue to hold global trade hostage in the red sea 
 since january the world have become even more dangerous not less and we continue to ask more of our courageous and professional armed force our sailor have serve under constant risk of attack in the red sea help to protect international shipping and our own cost of living we have bolster our royal air force presence in the middle east enable typhoon crew to intercept iranian drone and missile recently fire towards israel and around of our personnel from all of our service with a huge inventory of naval air and land asset have be active around europe as part of the large nato training exercise since the cold war in short we increasingly need our armed force and we increasingly be ask more of they 
 so yesterday the prime minister commit to hit spend of gdp for defence by it mean we will invest an additional £ into defence over the next year and that will be fund in full without any increase in either borrowing or debt this represent the big strengthening of our national defence in a generation and as the nato secretary general say yesterday it will ensure the uk remain by far the large european defence spender in nato and it mean we be the big nato spender overall 
 it will provide a very significant boost for uk defence science innovation and manufacturing it will make our defence industry more resilient and big and it will mean we be able to restock some of the global supply require in order to continue to ensure that we be both able to provide our own armed force and those in ukraine and be a competitive export sector we also recognise the important role defence play in our national resilience by develop a new plan that for the time bring together the civil and military planning for how we would respond to the most severe risk that our country face 
 our additional £ on defence be also enable we to ramp up that support for ukraine member on both side of the house will share the government ’s concern about the warning president zelensky have be issue and his most senior general have confirm that their the ability to match russian force be increasingly difficult so as nato partner we be look at each other to see that leadership 
 the uk government have step forward we be provide the alliance with the decisive leadership demand in this knife edge moment of this existential war this   week we have commit an extra £ of military aid to ukraine for this year bring our total package to £ in fact our total since putin ’s full scale invasion be now more than £ £ of which be in military aid 
 in addition we have provide nato partner with leadership by delve even deep into our own military inventory to give ukraine our large package of equipment and support to date the support announce this week include million of round of ammunition key munition include air defence and precision long range missile over armour protect and all terrain vehicle support with logistic to support and bolster the frontline support to get the f-16 pilot who have train in the uk into the air as soon as possible and a further boat to help ukraine strengthen its remarkable grip over the black sea include offshore raid craft and dive boat 
 our £ defence investment will help ukraine get back on to the front foot couple with the reform that we have introduce to make procurement fast and more effective it will put our defence industrial base on a war footing it will fire up the uk ’s defence industry with an additional £ over the next decade for munition production that will bring our total spend on munition to about £ over the same period 
 we be deliver for those who serve to guarantee our freedom as well with over £ to be invest in upgrade accommodation to build new living quarter for our personnel over the next decade we be also work seamlessly with key ally to strengthen our collective deterrence and develop new innovative capability just last month i be in australia with our australian and us partner to advance our aukus programme which will develop and deliver a range of cut edge kit in addition to the next generation of nuclear power submarine at the end of last year i be in japan to advance our global combat air programme which be the development of the generation fighter jet with italy and japan 
 just last week i be in telford to see the fully british tank for year come off the production line that be just strand of our future soldier programme to make our army more integrated and much more lethal of course defence already support hundred of thousand of job with real quality to they in the uk include over directly in the industry our additional £ will open up many more opportunity in region up and down the country 
 this be a turning point in uk defence we must spend more because defence of the realm be the duty of every government we on the government side of the house recognise that fact but while i want to see peace and international order be restore i be also absolutely convinced that it be hopeful thinking even complacency to imagine that we can do that without ensure that we be well protect the good way of keep a country safe and protect our way of life be deterrence be prepare be clear eyed about the threat we face be clear about our capability back uk defence science technology and innovation carry not just a big stick but the most advanced and capable stick that we can possibly develop and yes use our military muscle alongside our ally 
 our investment in our continuous at sea nuclear deterrent make would be adversary think twice we on the government side of the house have not come to the conclusion that our nation ’s nuclear deterrent be there because an election be approach we have always believe in our nuclear deterrent 
 this be an additional £ boost for our force in the build up to the nato summit in washington i will do all i can to get alliance member to follow our lead and bolster their armed force strengthen their industrial base invest in innovation maximise their military deterrence and most importantly of all maximise their support for ukraine in a more dangerous world where we face an axis of authoritarian state must become the new baseline for the entire alliance if we be to deter lead and defend that be what be require of we i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for the advance copy of his statement there be much to welcome in it and more widely today with the us congress finally pass the bill for more military aid to ukraine and the prime minister finally make a multi year commitment to uk military aid beyond this year 
 we face a much more dangerous world british force be in action defend international shipping in the red sea reinforce nato ally on the russian border and protect we all they be respect worldwide for their total professionalism they require our support from all side of this house we welcome the new commitment on funding for ukraine and to build up stockpile to boost defence export to prioritise domestic defence production and to set up new strategic headquarters in the mod all plan i have argue for in this post 
 the secretary of state be right to say that the duty of any government be to defend the country and keep its citizen safe labour will always do what be require and spend what be require on defence the last time the uk do spend of gdp on defence be in under labour never match in any of the tory year since week ago the labour leader say that we want a fully fund plan for of gdp on defence 
 we share the same ambition as the government because we must do more to deal with the grow threat we want it to be fully cost and fully fund and set out in the government ’s baseline budget this target be not it be in a press release why be the plan not in last month ’s budget or any of the other budgets and autumn statement since the government promise to spend by year ago none hit none reverse the real cut in day to day defence spending none match labour ’s record in government if this plan have be in a budget it would have be independently check openly cost and fully fund where be the additional money come from how much be come from which other research and development budget how much be come from cut how many civil servant and in which department 
 the government have try this trick before in the defence review minister pledge to cut of mod civil servant in order to make their defence   spending plan add up civil servant number do not go down instead of go down to they go up to the secretary of state mention an additional £ time in his statement over the next year the government ’s official spending plan be base on real annual growth in core defence spending why have he invent his own growth baseline to produce this fake figure claim an extra £ for defence the public will judge ministers by what they do not what they say over year they have hollow out our armed force they have cut the army to its small size since napoleon they have miss their own recruitment target each and every year they have allow morale to fall to record low and they have waste at least £ on mismanage defence procurement 
 everyone recognise that defence spending must rise to deal with increase threat the opposition have no access to classified threat assessment or military advice so if we be elect to government we will conduct a strategic defence review within our year to get to grip with the threat we face the capability we need the state of the armed force and the resource available when we get to open the book that be how labour will manage the requirement for strong national security and the responsibility for sound public finance 
 the defence secretary clearly like labour ’s plan for defence because so much of they be now government policy but there be still no tory plan to reinforce homeland protection with a new strategic review to fulfil nato obligation in full with a nato test on our major programme to renew the nation ’s contract with those who serve with an independent force commissioner and to make ally our strategic strength with a new eu french or german defence agreement with threat increase and tension grow we must make britain well defend with labour britain will be well defend 
 let i start on the area that i agree with the right hon gentleman mention how much we welcome the us congress put $ into the defence of ukraine we warmly welcome that as churchill be repute to have say america usually get on and do the right thing when it have exhaust all other alternative it take a long time but we have get to the point where that money will go to ukraine that be very welcome across the house 
 the right hon gentleman say that he welcome today ’s announcement but then spend all his time explain or rather avoid explain why labour be not back which have a schedule a timescale and figure that have be publish and be in the document produce yesterday and lay in the library he say judge we by our action not our word we will because member of the opposition front bench team vote against trident it be no good for he and the leader of the opposition to go up to barrow and to claim that they be all in favour of the nuclear defence because they stand on a platform with a leader who want to scrap trident pull we out of nato and turn the army into a peace corps 
 the opposition tell we judge we on our action where be the shadow foreign secretary who vote against trident where be the shadow deputy prime minister and the shadow communities secretary who   vote against trident neither be there on the front bench presumably neither be in full agreement with the right hon gentleman when it come to the defence of the realm and defend this country the conservative party have always believe in our nuclear deterrent we be upgrade it and make sure it be fit for purpose neither support the as the house will have note 
 it be fine for the right hon gentleman to come to the dispatch box and talk about yet another review if the problem be have defence review there would be no issue at all the last thing this country and armed force require be yet another review delay disruption and obfuscation 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 my right hon friend be right to say that we be continually ask more of our armed force as the defence committee ’s recent report make clear in that context i greatly welcome the announcement and the increase investment we want it to unleash a triple whammy in which our industrial partner also seize the opportunity to invest heavily in capital equipment and r&d and in which our nato ally see this as a new benchmark to which those who do not already can aspire and meet what be we do to ensure that we not only make the investment but achieve that triple whammy 
 my right hon friend the chair of the defence committee be absolutely right on the investment point i speak to my opposite number us defence secretary lloyd austin yesterday evening about how it will help to galvanise nato in particular to make great investment when we go to the nato summit in washington for the anniversary the new baseline will be rather than the set by the uk in which or so of nato ’s member have now reach that investment send a very important signal to the whole defence industrial base that be why it be critical to set out the plan and stick to it and agree to reach by 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the secretary of state clearly have a herculean task to find £ so let we seek clarity on where it may be find i welcome the investment if it be in capability i agree with the shadow secretary of state on why it be not in the budget i think we all know why it do not stand up to scrutiny let i also welcome the secretary of state ’s investment in ukraine on the back of the us commitment i have to say to our us colleague that it be long overdue let i ask some specific question it be the duty of opposition to challenge government and we will have our difference 
 with no increase in borrowing or debt the implication be that there will be deep cut to other public service if the government have assume a baseline with spend freeze in cash term as of gdp as i think be allude to by the shadow defence secretary it come nowhere near £ as i come from a service family i wonder if the secretary of state will commit to a direct increase in spend on accommodation training and recruitment as part of this proposal give that we   be at a near napoleonic decline on the frontline and have push member of the armed force into food bank and near penury 
 the secretary of state and i will of course disagree on the nuclear deterrent but i wonder if he will answer specific point while he retain it the nuclear enterprise have be expose as unaffordable in the late report by the national audit office what assurance can he give the house that the nuclear deterrent will not continue to cannibalise the ministry of defence budget and specifically the £ he have propose today 
 the thing i should point out be that page in the annex of the document before the house describe the uplift in the defence budget we have headline it as £ in fact when we go through and add up the individual amount year on year it reach £ of expenditure member can see there exactly how we will get to it 
 secondly it be fully fund i know the labour party do not like the idea but we will remove civil servant from the system not because we do not think they be good people fortunately with low unemployment we know they will be gainfully employ elsewhere but because we want to get back to the size of the civil service we have before covid before it expand greatly we see no reason to continue to run a civil service with additional people each year when that money could go into the defence of the realm 
 the hon gentleman ask about our commitment to our armed force personnel their family and their accommodation he may have miss it in my statement but i mention £ that we will now invest in their accommodation and condition over this period thank to this big uplift he will be aware that last year there be a lot of problem with leak and boiler not be fix for considerable period of time there have not be those story this year because we get on top of that with £ and by make sure that contractor be do their job 
 as the hon gentleman rightly say we have our difference on thing like nuclear deterrence but if there be thing that benefit scotland in particular i would suggest it be what go on at faslane with the extraordinary high quality job it produce and the proud part it play in this nation ’s defence 
 i call the chair of the intelligence and security committee 
 the main reason why this welcome uplift have come when it have be russia ’s aggression against ukraine do the secretary of state agree that if russia and putin be see to fail in ukraine the threat to nato will be put back for at least a generation conversely if they succeed the threat to nato will intensify will he therefore do everything he can to persuade our ally especially certain part of the united states new political establishment that the success of ukraine be essential for the peace of europe and indeed the peace of the world 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right although this be £ and although it take our budget to of gdp that be a fraction a fraction of what it would cost if putin be successful   in ukraine there be no chance he would stop there none other autocrat elsewhere would look at that and exploit the idea that all they have to do be outwait the west and we will get bored of it through some form of attention deficit and give up defend the thing we say we would never stop defend that in the end would cost we all a huge amount more 
 may i of all congratulate the secretary of state on his stellar use car salesman act which we have become use to on   march he appear along with official before the defence committee his strategic finance director confirm that next year when we take ukraine funding out of the budget the defence budget fall can he tell the house how he reconcile that fact which be confirm by his own official with his claim today and the prime minister ’s yesterday to be put the country on a war foot 
 i be really sorry that the right hon gentleman cheapen what be a very important discussion about the defence of the realm with such a ridiculous remark we should all come here in the right spirit to discuss these important issue give the subject matter he ask about ukraine ukraine be a part of what our armed force and this country be have to deal with we do not ask america to strip out its help to ukraine in the same way that we do not ask it to strip out its help to afghanistan or iraq because it be part of the core defence budget yesterday i do not mention this in my statement and perhaps on this basis the right hon gentleman may be forgive we also say that our enhanced amount of money for ukraine be not now just for this year but we be go to carry on do it every single year into the future so yes it be part of our core expense 
 i commend the secretary of state for obtain this massive £ increase in defence which theoretically would allow we to buy new queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier at the risk of upset our excellent sea lord we be not likely to do that but we be put our defence industry on a war footing can we do the concomitant thing and create a war reserve of equipment with old typhoons old warship and old armoured vehicle so that if we have to fight at short notice we would have enough equipment to do it and so that we can tell our adversary that when we say si vis pacem para bellum we actually mean it 
 i thank my right hon friend not just for his word but for his constant campaigning on this subject those of we who have be subject to he in a select committee know that he know his fact know what he be talk about and have do as much as anybody to ensure that this uplift be happen i can confirm for the house that we will not be use the £ for new aircraft carrier 
 my right hon friend make an interesting point about what we could do with old equipment i have to say to he that right now i be much more minded to send that equipment to ukraine that be why yesterday i pull together the big donation package to date in what be now the year of the war of equipment to ukraine for the time be i think we will be send it in an easterly direction 
 can i ask the secretary of state what he believe a war foot be 
 very simply ukraine have teach the world a great deal about this when it come to for instance produce sufficient munition to restock   the ukrainians supply it be very difficult in fact impossible to do that instantaneously when there be global competition for 155s or other missile we want to ensure that our own industrial defence estate be able to produce such item by tell those in the industry that they be on a war footing by put in £ more and critically name the date by which we will get there we will put they on that war footing 
 i commend my right hon friend for his stalwart stubbornness in secure this important increase in defence spending he and i both know that much more money be need but this be a step in the right direction he be off shortly to meet nato member and i fear that he will have a great deal of work to do for example only nato member be prepared to open fire on the houthis in the strait of hormuz of the major trade route for nato and the west do my right hon friend feel that there will be a lot of work for he to do when he go to meet those nato member and ask they to step up and spend on defence as they should do and as we be go to do 
 i thank my hon and gallant friend for his comment he be right to point out the need to be prepared to use the ability that we have ours be of the only country with both the global reach and the desire and preparedness to use those ability which be why we have end up defend ship in the red sea from the houthis i can report that a specific incident along those line have take place today with our armed force in action and we can be very proud of everything they do for we 
 on behalf of the liberal democrats i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s statement about increase defence spending although it relate to a time year hence rather than be specific about funding in the intervene year of the member of nato be still not spend even of gdp on defence include france spain and italy encourage they to spend more be not so much about fairness as about persuade sceptic in the united states that north america should remain engaged in europe leverage at the nato summit in july will come too late what additional commitment do the secretary of state and other ministers obtain from our ally before announce the pledge 
 i assure the hon gentleman that it start this year the half a pound be in this year ’s budget we have opt to give that money directly to ukraine in addition to the money that we be already gift it bring the total to £ 
 secondly let i gently say that i do not think i have ever hear liberal democrats argue for more defence spending but i strongly welcome the hon gentleman to the cause i agree with he entirely that 2%—which we ourselves set back in be no long the baseline   that we should be work to but i gently point out to he that the reason it have take some time to replace trident and in particular the submarine be that there be a short period under the coalition when we could not get our liberal democrat partner to agree to get on with the job 
 may i in pass pay tribute to the late frank field he vote for the renewal of trident unlike many on the labour front bench and he would have understand that deepen our defence capability in the conventional force be a vital part of the deterrence that nato provide for the security of europe i commend my right hon friend and the government for lead the way on this and set an example through leadership 
 i thank my hon friend and add my condolence to those already convey by other frank field be a great statesman with really innovative idea about welfare reform which it take this government to enact and he be a great loss to we all 
 i entirely agree with my hon friend about our leadership in nato in get to i be talk about that to the secretary general of nato yesterday we must ensure that be the new level at which people operate if they do if everyone join we at 2.5%—there would be £ per annum more in the collective nato budget which would make a huge difference 
 labour be absolutely committed to reach and we welcome the additional £ for ukraine but time be of the essence what be the secretary of state do to speed up the delivery of much need military supply to the frontline in ukraine 
 i warmly welcome the hon lady ’s comment and i hope very much that those on her front bench who have not attach themselves to the timeline that she urge have listen closely to what she have say as for the delivery of item to the frontline we will be very fast we will deliver in a matter of day or week quite a lot of the item outline in the very extensive package announce yesterday although they come in a number of different form and some by their physical nature will take long to deliver than other 
 i welcome the announcement and indeed the decision that have finally be make in the united states can my right hon friend confirm that investment will go into not just technology but the logistic the warehousing and the background facility here in the uk such as those at mod longtown a very important employer for my constituency to ensure that our frontline force be supply with the good kit that they could possibly have 
 my right hon friend can certainly have that reassurance we know that such support be extraordinarily important to the running of truly lethal and effective armed force 
 in every year since the government along with their liberal democrat partner have miss recruitment target and the times have warn that army number could fall to full time equivalent what be the defence secretary do to ensure that those who wish to serve and defend our country be not put off by the broken recruitment system 
 the hon lady will be pleased to hear that in january and february we have an year high in the number of application for the army which be reflect in the other service i agree that we need to be much more effective in get application all the way through the system it take too long and the procedure be too disparate people be have to turn up for an initial interview go away and then come back for a medical why not do all those thing at once 
 however other measure be really help there have be a pay increase of nearly for the less well pay member of the armed force in the last year which have help with recruitment and people see our armed force involve in so much action have also help the minister for defence people and families be spend a great deal of time ensure that the many recommendations—67 i think in the haythornthwaite review be implement as quickly as possible 
 i join the many voice that have call for some time for an increase in defence spending and we welcome this announcement i suspect that privately the defence secretary be hop that this day would come as well and i congratulate he on the work that he have do behind the scene to ensure that this funding be secure 
 state on state conflict have return in europe and the world be more dangerous more contested and more polarised will the defence secretary therefore expand a little on the consequence to uk security and to the uk economy if russia win before rush in to spend these increase fund will he recognise the need to consider the full spectrum of threat and warfare that we face so that money be wisely spend 
 my right hon and gallant friend have be a very important part of ensure that we get to where we be today but i have not realise that i have be keep my own desire to reach this point quite so secret he be correct in say that the implication of russia ’s win this war would be horrendous the cost of what this country have to put up with because of covid for example would seem small in comparison with the cost of what could happen if other autocratic state decide to take a chunk of other people ’s land that could have a direct impact on our economy 
 this be not in my view money that we be spend it be money that we be invest in our security to ensure that russia and other despotic leader like putin never think that they can try it on with we we will be invest it extremely wisely in many programme with which my right hon friend and other member on both side of the house be familiar as well as in innovative new area such as the dragonfire 
 may i thank the secretary of state for the urgent support for ukraine which be much   need just now however the institute for fiscal studies point out that in the chancellor ’s budget there be a conspiracy of silence between the government and the labour party on follow the fiscal rule when it come to say where £ worth of cut to public service would come from today ’s announcement add up to another £ of cut to public service can he explain where those cut will be make 
 we have already lay out the fact that this plan be fully cost and fund as i have mention to the house we have say that we will reduce the size of the civil service by that be not a off cut it be money that be not be pay each year and will help to fund defence there be also some other thing that the chancellor will no doubt wish to get into i do not know whether the hon gentleman have take a look at page and the annexe but he will see that this be all set out 
 i absolutely welcome this very important investment in defence as my right hon friend say the world be a change place and i be sure that he would agree that defence be indeed a public service on the extra funding and the project that he have announce may i ask he to make sure that he say to the treasury that the programme should be fully fund this should not just be capital investment the treasury have a habit of say the capital investment be fine but let ’s not worry about revenue the project will need revenue so will he make sure to have those conversation with the treasury 
 my right hon friend make a very clear point base on his experience of the department we have to make sure not just that we fund the capital but that we have the resource to run the equipment he raise a very important matter and this budget enable we to ensure that this be do properly 
 i too welcome the increase to the world have definitely become a more dangerous place over the last year i can only suppose that the announcement be not make in last month ’s budget because it would have come under scrutiny from the office for budget responsibility but could the defence secretary say exactly what proportion of the will be spend on cyber security and armed service personnel 
 i should point out to the house that we have always say that we would do this when condition allow inflation fall to last week down from over day ago we see iran fire hundred of missile at a democratic state and we be partly involve in the collective defence it be therefore true to say that the world be show itself to be even more dangerous we have reach the point where we be see growth back in the economy and inflation fall so now be the right time to do this the hon lady ask about the sum of money that will go into for example cyber or space i do not have those figure on i i would be very happy to write to she with an overview because it will take a bit of collation to work that out exactly from the exist budget quite a lot of what happen in strategic   command which cover those area cross over into other part of the armed force so it be not a simple question to answer 
 this be a very welcome statement so i thank my right hon friend he mention the haythornthwaite report when will we get an update particularly on the plan to spend the £ investment in service family accommodation 
 very soon 
 i accept the need for additional defence spending but may i ask the defence secretary for reassurance that the government ’s strategy for uk and global security go forward will have an appropriate balance of hard and soft power by that i mean ongoing investment in diplomacy humanitarian assistance international development potentially include the restoration of the target of spend of gross national income and indeed support for the international rule base order 
 i can certainly reassure the hon gentleman that that be something that we in the mod be always look to do we have just make our or drop of food aid into gaza use the raf we be work with the americans on other solution include the pier and i work very closely with the foreign commonwealth and development office indeed i use to be a minister in the former department for international development so i be well aware of the issue he raise the mod will always look to assist with our armed force wherever we can we often combine hard and soft power
