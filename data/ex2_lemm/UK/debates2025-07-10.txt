 the hon lady seem to want more delivery stat so let i help she out as my right hon friend the minister without portfolio say we have have the high growth of any g7 economy in the quarter of this year cut in interest rate and an expansion of the warm home discount which will mean that household will benefit from well insulate house i do not claim in read out these statistic that everything be perfect far from it but i do believe that we have have change in the past year change in the investment pattern of the country change in real wage and change in our trading position that be change well worth have 
 last night   the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi   present a petition from the solicitor to the omagh bombing inquiry ask for access to unreported evidence from the northern ireland affairs committee inquiry into the bombing on   august i have also receive a letter from   the hon member for gower and the hon member for north dorset simon hoare   ask that this matter be give precedence as a matter of privilege on the ground that 
 we suggest that the house should be give an opportunity to consider that petition but it be profoundly unsatisfactory for it to have to make a decision without any ability for any member to assess the propriety of release the evidence or of the privilege issue which may be raise by refer such material to a statutory inquiry which we understand be a place out of parliament for the purpose of article of the bill of rights 
 i have consider the issue and decide that this be a matter for which i should allow the precedence accord to issue of privilege the hon member may therefore table a motion to be debate on monday the motion will be take after any urgent question or statement and before the government business it will be available to member once it have be table which will be before the rise of the house today 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of the new trading relationship with the eu 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of the new uk eu trading relationship 
 we have reset our relationship with the european union and be now focus on deliver a long term strategic partnership to improve the life of work people and make the uk more prosperous that be good for bill good for our border and good for job 
 in the uk join the european economic community which later become the european union give this week ’s visit by the french president and this government ’s desire for close co operation with the eu will the minister confirm that no new or exist trade deal will lead to this country rejoin the eu through the back door 
 that be absolutely not the case what we have with the european union be a new deal that the supermarket say have put a downward pressure on price and which octopus energy say will bring the cost of energy down i be surprised to hear that reform be against that but since it have welcome liz truss ’s party chairman as a new member today perhaps it be no surprise that reform take that view 
 yesterday on farming today at am it be put to a shellfish farmer that it be go to become much easy for she to export her produce to the european union her response be yes but we be tell that the change will be or perhaps year away if they happen at all give what we have negotiate away can those change be expedite 
 i be determined to expedite these new arrangement as quickly as possible it be fantastic to see the opposition take that position i think the right hon gentleman ’s front benchers be against they 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as the minister will be aware under the exist framework the uk be entitle to take unilateral measure to protect the internal market where there be a diversion of trade the federation of small businesses northern ireland say that a of business that previously trade between great britain and northern ireland have cease to do so we know from his interview yesterday that the minister do not consider quarter of deportation be voluntary to represent a majority but do he consider a of business to be a diversion of trade if he do not what would be a diversion of trade 
 on   july we introduce the phase check under the windsor framework the windsor framework be negotiate by the previous government and we support it from the opposition benches i assume that the conservatives continue to support those arrangement obviously we monitor the issue of trade diversion very carefully and we stand ready to help business adjust to the new arrangement 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 a few month ago this government reach a small but welcome trade agreement with the eu our large trading partner and just this week member of this house hear from the president of france emmanuel macron about the closeness of the relationship between the uk and france it be the state visit by a french president since and the by a european union political leader since brexit now that uk eu relation   be at a turning point do the minister agree that it be finally time to be more ambitious drop the red line cut the red tape and aim to negotiate a uk eu custom union that would boost the public coffer by £ a year 
 we have deliver an ambitious new trading arrangement with the european union we have also deliver a new free trade agreement with india and an economic deal with the united states what the hon lady be suggest would take away our freedom to be able to do that which be contribute to our economy 
 what discussion he have have with his eu counterpart on visa rule for uk citizen visit the schengen area for in day 
 government official and minister include i regularly engage the eu on a range of issue of importance to british citizen the uk and the eu allow for visa travel in line with the standard arrangement for country national the uk government will continue to listen to and advocate for british citizen 
 many thousand of constituent include philip and kathryn in my constituency live for part of the year in spain prior to brexit they do so without restriction but now they face limited visa option result in more frequent flying what conversation have the minister have with spain ’s government about end these barrier 
 i thank philip and kathryn for raise this issue and i know my hon friend be a powerful advocate for they the foreign office lead on bilateral issue with eu member state and they regularly engage on a range of issue while we recognise that extend the day period be a matter for member state and the eu my hon friend can be assure that we will continue to listen to and advocate for uk national affect 
 as the minister know northern ireland be in that wonderful limbo land of movement half in the united kingdom and half in the eu because of the unfinished protocol bill can he tell we how those in northern ireland will be affect by the schengen area due to the particular and perhaps peculiar position they be in as a result of the protocol 
 northern ireland have the unique advantage of dual market access on the wide issue of application of eu law that the hon gentleman be talk about he can be assure that as co chair of the joint committee i work carefully and closely on these matter with the northern ireland executive 
 what step he be take to relocate civil service role to location outside london 
 my hon friend and parliamentary neighbour be absolutely right to raise the importance of have a civil service presence around the country he will know the importance of the ministry for housing communities and local government presence in wolverhampton to the local area we want to see half of our uk base senior civil servant locate outside london by we recently announce plan to relocate thousand of civil service role to town and city across the whole uk 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer i do indeed feel blessed to have the dual head- quarter of the ministry of housing communities and local government which employ more than people right next to my constituency office in wolverhampton west i welcome the government ’s plan to move civil servant role out of london into community such as mine will my right hon friend please set out how these role will work closely with business the city of wolverhampton council and community in my constituency as well as help my constituent to pursue career as civil servant 
 my hon friend raise some good point we do not just want to see building with no connection to the local community it be important that they have that connection i also want to ensure good career progression in civil service building outside london i recently announce a new civil service apprenticeship scheme so that we can recruit people from all background to the civil service and make sure that they can get promote and enjoy a good civil service career 
 the last government see civil servant job relocate not just to wolverhampton but to stoke on trent it be important that the very top level of the civil service be also locate outside of london so will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out how many permanent secretary be currently locate permanently outside london what step will he take to ensure that more permanent secretary be locate in both wolverhampton and stoke on trent 
 we do not have a permanent secretary in wolverhampton but it be important that there be career progression and that there be senior role outside london that should include permanent secretary and that should all come within our target of half of uk base senior civil servant be locate outside london by 
 i call the shadow minister 
 head of departments have say that attendance in the office be the good balance for civil servant work in government departments but in an answer to a recent write parliamentary question from my hon friend   the member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood the cabinet office say that no data exist for attendance outside london hqs it be certainly not collect centrally however the office for national statistics have produce datum about its own workforce which via the uk statistics authority come under the cabinet office that show a daily attendance   rate of as little as in some of the ons ’s regional office do the minister think that an attendance rate of will help career progression and thereby help relocate civil servant outside london do he think that be acceptable be this not just part of a wide pattern of non attendance in office outside london and be it not time his department publish the datum on attendance level 
 there have be problem at the office for national statistics we launch a report into it which have recently report and there will be a change in the leadership of the office for national statistics as the right hon gentleman be aware that report highlight the number of people not work in the office a pattern that emerge when his party be in power i hope that the new leadership address every part of the recent report into the ons 
 the government recently announce a number of measure to reform the civil service include cut up to job and relocate thousand of role across the country these reform be vast in scope and could have a significant impact on public service but the government do not seem particularly interested in set out to parliament the detail of the change this house have not be give any clarity to enable proper scrutiny of which role will be move cut or otherwise change when will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster present his full plan on civil service reform to parliament 
 on   may the government announce the launch of new thematic campus in aberdeen and manchester and the closure of building and reaffirm the commitment on relocate of senior role outside london which i just mention the hon lady say these be vast commitment but i think we need to go fast reform of the state be essential and those commitment will not be the end of civil service and state reform 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 on   may we hold the ever uk eu summit and announce a strategic partnership that will make people across the uk safe more secure and more prosperous we be deliver great security via the security and defence partnership increase safety through tackle irregular migration and organised crime and prosperity through the removal of trade barrier energy efficiency and a cheap transition to net that be good for bill good for job and good for border 
 i thank my right hon friend the minister for his answer give that he lead on uk eu relation will he outline how the cabinet office will ensure that the new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement will reduce the level of check on good at both the eurotunnel terminal in folkstone in my constituency and the port of dover and improve the flow of trade what step be be take to far break down barrier to trade in good with the eu 
 my hon and learn friend be a powerful advocate for his constituent in folkestone and hythe the sps agreement will remove routine border check and certification include for good travel through folkestone and the port of dover it will mean that fresh produce will hit supermarket shelf more quickly with less paperwork and few cost 
 the new agreement with the eu will help scottish business to grow and to export world class producer such as glenmorangie whisky which be bottle in my constituency paterson ’s shortbread which be bake in my constituency and the scottish salmon industry have warmly welcome the deal for scotland why do the minister think that the snp the tories and reform have set their face against it 
 my hon friend speak very powerfully for his local business and i be delighted that great produce such as paterson ’s shortbread lorne sausage and scottish seed potato will benefit from easy and cheap trade with the eu via the sps agreement any party that want to reverse that will have to explain why it want to take £ worth of benefit a year by away from our economy 
 do the minister agree with i that after year of the conservatives pick fight with our most important ally rather than work with they on the share challenge we face our recently agree trade deal and our close co operation on security and migration show the benefit of a grow up approach to improve relation with our european partner 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the trade and co operation agreement leave a massive gap in our ability to tackle irregular migration the agreement we have now make with the eu start the process of fill that gap through a comprehensive partnership it include enhance our operational relationship to tackle organise immigration crime and irregular migration with key agency such as europol 
 this government have a track record of announce trade deal and then nothing actually happen as our steel sector can attest month on from the prime minister crow about a deal with the eu will the minister confirm whether any legal text have be agree on sps check share criminal record datum and energy co operation and whether any of those measure have be implement 
 if the hon member be seriously say that our trade deal make no difference he should visit jaguar land rover and speak to the worker   there whose job be save by the economic deal with the united states he be absolutely right to say that the new common understanding be not in itself a legal text but we will be move to agree that legal text as soon as possible give the question from conservative back benchers so far they all seem to want it do as soon as possible despite the opposition from those on their front bench 
 if the last year have teach we nothing else they have surely teach we that it be much easy to agree about the need for an agreement than it be to reach an agreement the sps agreement will be critical for food and drink export we be only go to get chance on this so to get it right we need maximum engagement with the company and business do the exporting what be the minister do to ensure that their voice be hear in these negotiation and that the agreement suit they 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right which be why i have engage throughout the domestic advisory group under the previous trade and co operation agreement contain a range of stake- holder and i regularly speak to they but i go beyond that in my work with stakeholder he be right that it be hugely important that their voice be hear in the process of agree the legal text on the sps agreement 
 while we await the detail of the sps deal northern ireland be still see new and additional bureaucracy to implement the windsor framework do the minister agree that it would make more sense to extend the grace period and put a freeze on that bureaucracy rather than introduce more as indicate in the report by the federation of small businesses in northern ireland 
 on our ability to negotiate generally it be hugely important that we show good faith in implement the agreement that the country previously agree however i say to the hon gentleman that i always show pragmatism on implement the windsor framework if we take parcel for example when i go to belfast last summer i be tell that there be no readiness for business there but i apply for and secure a month delay and then implement that part of the agreement so he can be assure that i take a pragmatic approach 
 what recent progress he have make on implement the plan for change 
 our plan for change be already deliver the change the country vote for a year ago great british energy headquarter in aberdeen be invest £ in offshore wind supply chain benefit worker in our industrial heartland britain have the high growth in the g7 in the quarter of this year interest rate have be cut time and wage be rise fast than price there be more to do but after year of decline under the tories and almost decade of snp rule in scotland the country be turn a corner with this labour government 
 last week the health secretary share his plan to improve the nhs by give patient more control over their treatment patient in england be now able to book appointment and order their prescription on the nhs app with the lack of an nhs app in scotland be describe as a national embarrassment do the minister agree with i that people live in scotland be be leave behind 
 my hon friend make an important point under this labour government nhs waiting list be fall and we have an ambitious plan for the future of the nhs under the snp scotland have an analogue government in a digital age and scotland ’s patient be miss out scotland need a new direction which i hope it will take with anas sarwar ’s scottish labour party next year 
 yesterday i meet member of the spanish senate with whom i discuss energy security and how to bring down energy bill for our resident on either side of the channel it be clear that energy trading between the eu and the uk do not work properly what can we do and what progress have be make to improve the interconnector and make the investment that be so necessary 
 order i be not quite sure whether it be relevant but please answer if you be happy to minister 
 it be in the common understanding and we want a deep relationship with our partner in the eu on this issue 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster 
 in their plan for change the government pledge to get the country the high sustained growth in the g7 or back to where the conservative government leave it however it seem that this government be on course to fail all respected international analysis by the oecd the world bank the international monetary fund and so on suggest that over the next year the uk economy will grow nothing like as fast as the united states or canada what analysis can the minister point to that suggest otherwise 
 since come into government a year ago we have take measure to fix the mess leave behind by the conservatives that be why in the quarter of this year we be the fast grow economy in the g7 interest rate have go down time mean people be pay less on their mortgage and wage be rise fast than price that be the difference that a labour government make 
 it be no surprise that the minister could not point to any analysis because no such analysis exist that be because the government have no plan for growth they do have a plan for tax and they have a plan for borrowing much more borrowing the office for budget responsibility ’s excoriate report early this week highlight just how dangerous that be indeed under this government there be the very real prospect   of a sovereign debt crisis where be the government ’s plan to avoid that it be not clear that the market can wait until november 
 our plan for growth be central to this mission drive government our investment in housing build home will add £ to the economy by the end of the parliament we be get build with spade in the ground on our rail and road project and get on where the tories fail this country for year 
 what progress he have make on publish a tracking dashboard for the plan for change metric 
 what progress he have make on publish a tracking dashboard for the plan for change metric 
 what progress he have make on publish a tracking dashboard for the plan for change metric 
 our plan for change be already deliver for the british people as the minister without portfolio my right hon friend   the member for lewisham west and east dulwich ellie reeves have just say wage up more in the month of our government than in year under the previous government a new nuclear age with £ commit to build sizewell c as a critical part of our clean energy transition and nhs waiting list down by more than for the time in year what a contrast to the record of the conservatives 
 will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster reassure the house that once he have actually start publish the tracking dashboard for the plan for change the milestone will not go the same way as the foundation the step for change the mission and the pillar of growth and that it will not be abandon and replace when the government realise they be miss their target 
 if the hon gentleman want more fact about delivery let i help he out right now last week we launch the big social and affordable housing programme in a generation meet a need that have be unmet for year in this country we have extend free school meal to half a more child and this year we will be put more neighbourhood police back on the beat i be very happy to give the hon gentleman all the figure he want 
 give that the government ’s plan for change track dashboard be still in development can i ask the minister to include a column or facility to track all the u turn or as the government may prefer to call it the change to the plan for change subject to change that way the public can see where those u turn have take place such as on winter fuel payment the grooming gang inquiry and welfare reform it would also help labour back benchers to keep up with the government ’s current position 
 i hear a cry for more delivery statistic so let i help the hon member out we have also recruit new gps deport people with no right to be here and expand free school meal to lift child out of poverty he be welcome 
 the government be clearly very happy to claim that all be rosy after their year in power yet on the ground in my constituency and around the country the opposite story be be tell the government ’s policy be hit my constituent hard whether it be the impact of increase national insurance contribution on local charity the prospect of more red tape for landlord or move the goalpost for the most vulnerable give the government ’s amazing claim why be they so reticent to share the plan for change metric in place so that the good people up and down the united kingdom can see the reality of this labour government in hard fact 
 more stat 
 the hon lady seem to want more delivery stat so let i help she out as my right hon friend the minister without portfolio say we have have the high growth of any g7 economy in the quarter of this year cut in interest rate and an expansion of the warm home discount which will mean that household will benefit from well insulate house i do not claim in read out these statistic that everything be perfect far from it but i do believe that we have have change in the past year change in the investment pattern of the country change in real wage and change in our trading position that be change well worth having.[official report   september vol c. 2wc correction 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 for too long resident and frontline worker have have to navigate fragmented and underfunded service and have have to arm up for battle when use public service from our best start strategy to new neighbourhood health centre we be reform public service so that money be invest in prevention service be design with and for local community and people always come 
 do the minister agree that while waiting list in england be fall thank to billion of pound of investment into our national health service it be an absolute disgrace that despite record level of money be provide to the scottish government waiting list in scotland continue to rise 
 as my hon friend have set out since labour come to power we have see waiting list continue to fall with our new appointment but the scottish people have not see the same benefit luckily though they do not need to wait long to vote for a labour government with a plan to change that 
 if he will bring forward legislative proposal to introduce a legal duty of candour on public body 
 we be fully commit to introduce a hillsborough law include a legal duty of candour for public servant and criminal sanction for those who refuse to comply we have be engage with the family and we will continue to do so 
 there be a long list of mp ministers and prime ministers on both side of the house who enable the establishment cover up at hillsborough which deny justice to the victim and survivor there have be only a few honourable exception of politician who do the right thing the establishment be a powerful force and it take real courage to confront its deep rooted fear of accountability give that the government have so far fail to deliver their promise to enact the hillsborough law do the minister recognise that this be a continuation of the betrayal of the hillsborough family survivor and all those affect by state cover up if he do recognise that will he support the reading of the hillsborough law that i have table tomorrow and if not why not 
 i pay tribute to the work that my hon friend have do i know that he speak on this matter from live experience he be have be and will continue to be an extraordinarily powerful advocate for the hillsborough family the assurance that i give he be that the government be absolutely determined to get this right 
 what support his department be provide to local partnership to improve public service delivery

 i thank the minister for all her hard work to bring together procurement information centrally for the time and to improve the quality of that datum what progress have be make to push that out to the public in the dashboard and analytic that will help we track and improve the public procurement system and monitor the government ’s strategic goal of back british small and medium sized enterprise and support key sector of the economy

 what step he be take to improve co operation with devolved government 
 the government be commit to work with all level of government to deliver for people across the whole united kingdom in the last few week i attend the interparliamentary forum to speak with colleague from across the legislature and i have hold productive discussion with devolved government colleague on our trade strategy 
 this labour government understand the importance of partnership in power year on i welcome that this partnership have deliver record funding for wales to improve our railway protect coal tip and boost our economy and our public service at the general election we rightly recognise that the welsh fiscal framework be outdate please could the minister provide an update on the progress be make to address this 
 i can give my hon friend the undertaking he seek we be commit to work in partnership with the welsh government to ensure that the framework be bring up to date and deliver value for money my official be support his majesty ’s treasury on how the framework can be update and that work be ongoing 
 be the government still commit to civil service across the united kingdom if so what be they proactively do to ensure that as part of their career development uk government civil servant can work within the devolve administration and that those within the devolved administration can have role within the uk government 
 i pay tribute to the work of the civil service not just for the uk government but across the united kingdom civil servant do tireless work on behalf of the public each and every day and be a critical part of this government ’s determination to deliver significant change for the country and drive forward the mission we have define to the right hon member ’s question in the early year of devolution there be a lot more interchange between the home civil service here in london and the civil service in office such as those in edinburgh belfast and cardiff i know that thought be be give to how we ensure that there be the right expertise in the right part of the country and there be an information exchange on how to get this right 
 what recent progress his department have make on strengthen national security 
 last month on behalf of the prime minister i make a statement in the house announce the national security strategy that coincide with the nato summit attend by the prime minister at its heart the strategy have pillar security at home strength abroad and increase our sovereign and asymmetric capability my department will lead on the co ordination of that work which apply not just in the cabinet office but right across government 
 cyber security be vital not just to our national security but to safeguard our public service so i be delighted that the government be invest in the sector through their cyber growth action plan some of that investment be go into my neighbouring town cheltenham but there be so many fantastic opportunity and potential opportunity in my city of gloucester will my right hon friend meet i to discuss how my constituent can access those opportunity and secure the well pay high skilled job of the future 
 recent event have show just how important cyber security be we have over business across the uk generating revenue of an estimate £ and job in this field we be also a large exporter of cyber product the truth be that we need training and capability in this new area of defence i be happy to ensure that my hon friend get a meeting with a relevant minister 
 the bbc cover the government ’s publication of the national security strategy last month with the headline uk must prepare for war scenario often the public will read an alarming headline like that without read about the context or about what it might mean for they or what they should do about it will the government draw on academic expertise such as that at the centre for the public understanding of defence and security at the university of exeter in engage with our constituent on this subject 
 the hon member make a very good point about engagement with the public anyone who have watch the news in recent year will know that the defence picture across europe be change i make a statement to the house early this week on the importance of resilience resilience be not just a matter for government although the government do have their responsibility it be a whole of society effort and it will require proper dialogue and communication with the public 
 what recent progress he have make on the infected blood compensation scheme 
 yesterday the infected blood inquiry publish an additional report on compensation the government will now urgently work through its recommendation and work closely with the infected blood compensation authority to understand the delivery implication and any policy change to the scheme with your permission mr speaker i hope to provide a further update to the house before the summer recess and people have be ask to start their compensation claim and offer of compensation have be make total over £ last week the government write to the public accounts committee and the public administration and constitutional affairs committee outline the step that the government be take to remove administrative barrier to allow ibca to speed up payment 
 i thank the minister for his answer and for the response to yesterday ’s report i speak today on behalf of of my constituent a core participant in the inquiry who be recently invite to start their claim they have ask specifically when those affect such as the parent of the infected will be invite to start their claim give that they have be wait for decade for justice and there be concern that delay may mean that they do not get to see it in their lifetime 
 i understand that concern my hon friend be a powerful voice for her constituent and i welcome the news that they have start their claim i know that many across the house will be eager for their constituent include those who be affect to begin their claim as soon as possible the government expect ibca to begin payment to those who be affect by the end of this year as i have set out the government be take step to remove administrative barrier to allow ibca to speed up payment i recognise that the   infect blood inquiry have also make a recommendation on the sequencing of payment which it will be for the infected blood compensation authority to consider 
 i remain concerned that sir brian langstaff have never ask i as the minister who be responsible for the design of the scheme to account for the process that i adopt under the advice of the civil servant that my successor the minister share i be concern now that there will be continue lack of clarity and certainty for those who have be wait for too long we appoint an expert group on the good advice of the civil servant we ensure that there would be engagement with representative from the group and i meet they over meeting in day prior to legislation come to this house i be gravely concerned that continue uncertainty through more report writing will not serve the good interest of this community do the minister agree and what step will he take to resolve these matter once and for all 
 i pay tribute to the work of my predecessor as paymaster general in this area i know the practical experience with which the right hon gentleman speak when i give evidence to the inquiry back in may i say that i be not bring a counsel of perfection and that i would listen to suggestion which i would judge on the basis of not cause further undue delay to victim who have already wait for too long that be the approach i will take as i urgently look at the recommendation with your permission mr speaker i will hopefully update the house on that before the summer recess 
 sir brian langstaff be particularly critical of the engagement with the infected and affected community since the publication of his final report in may last year in particular he be critical of the way the expert group be set up with the explicit instruction not to engage with the community do my right hon friend accept that a lot of damage have be do since the publication of that final report as be expose in the report that sir brian langstaff publish yesterday will he say what he intend to do to improve relationship with the infected and the affected 
 i be deeply sympathetic to the inquiry ’s word on the involvement of the infected blood community the government be commit to provide fair compensation to victim of this scandal the inquiry recognise this and say 
 there can be no doubt that the government have do right in way which powerfully signal its intent 
 however i also recognise what sir brian say when he state that 
 there be still more to be do to ensure that the detail and operation of the scheme match up to its intent 
 i will now urgently look at those recommendation with a view to action 
 my constituent graham be a victim of the infected blood scandal his experience and the length of time that he have have to wait for compensation have strong parallel with another constituent of mine steve who be the last raf officer   to go to prison for be gay both constituent have suffer decade of trauma as a result what parallel can the minister draw when learn about those compensation scheme and how will we ensure that in future the administration of such scheme be smooth swifter and a well experience for those who be impact 
 the hon lady speak very movingly about her constituent graham and steve who have clearly have to wait decade far too long for justice she raise a fair point about learn from compensation scheme this be historical for instance we have the windrush compensation scheme that begin under the previous government we have horizon ongoing and infected blood where the inquiry have just produce an additional report but the compensation scheme be ongoing 
 on infected blood ibca have use a test and learn approach which i think be important in allow we to move into a phase in which we can speed up payment to the hon lady ’s central point it be vital and i be conscious of this that we look at what have work well in previous compensation scheme and at what have work less well and be honest about that and learn from it 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since our last oral question session my department have announce that company that win contract for major infrastructure project will be reward for create high quality british job and boost skill in local community we set out our national security strategy to protect security at home promote uk strength abroad and increase our sovereign capability early this week we publish our resilience action plan which include detail of a new test of the national alarm system to come in september 
 the government ’s change to the green book in place base business case be positive for region like the north east will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out how the cabinet office will support cross departmental work on identify test case such as the moor farm and seaton burn roundabout in my constituency where infrastructure be hold back growth and housing and be need to help the government achieve our growth and housing mission 
 my hon friend be a brilliant champion for her community it be precisely because this government want to support growth in community like hers that the chancellor have set out that the new green book will support place base business case rapid work be happen to deliver that over the come month 
 i call the shadow chancellor for the duchy of lancaster 
 will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster confirm that civil servant should not engage in public fundraising for political party 
 we all know the rule for civil servant i think i know who he be refer to and let i anticipate the hon member ’s next question the person be do a wonderful job 
 well i will just fill in the house for those who be not as well inform as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the simple fact be that senior civil servant should not be engage in public fundraising from public speak for political party it have be report that on   june lord mandelson who the government classify as a senior civil servant speak at a labour fundraising event will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster assure the house that this breach will be properly investigate and treat 
 i believe there have be correspondence to the cabinet secretary about this he will reply in due course but let i add this lord mandelson be do an excellent job as our ambassador to the united states he be integral to the negotiation of the trade agreement with the united states and be a great asset to the government and the country 
 my constituent andy be of several former civil servant in my constituency affect by the mccloud judgment like many of they he be still wait to receive his hard- earn pension and the delay be cause serious distress while andy recover from major surgery he now face financial hardship due to many miss deadline and delay will the minister agree to meet i to discuss andy ’s case and the case of other constituent affect who have contact i to ensure that their case be resolve urgently 
 i be deeply sorry to hear about andy ’s circumstance and i will of course meet my hon friend to discuss this case i have ask to be keep personally update on the case follow the letter from my hon friend the cabinet office continue to stress the importance of contractual performance to the mycsp administrator 
 what step be the cabinet office take to ensure that all public body adopt robust cyber security framework and what be the timetable to ensure their compliance 
 as i say a few moment ago the recent cyber attack have be a wake up call to government business and the whole of society this be part of our national defence and it be take extremely seriously the national cyber security centre work with victim of these attack and give advice in peacetime as it be as to how business can well defend themselves against these rogue operator who try to extort they 
 i be recently make aware by ge vernova that its uk base low cost bid for the eastern green link be pass over in favour of a high cost overseas supplier would the minister meet i and ge vernova to discuss current procurement policy and whether it do enough to support uk manufacturing and to ensure our energy security and net commitment 
 while i can not comment on the individual procurement i can say that we be change procurement rule to strengthen the focus on british job and skill and to support british industry critical to our national security like energy we be consult on this at the moment and i would be more than happy to meet my hon friend and the company to discuss this far 
 it be a constant complaint from my business in harrow that if they be not on the government approve list they almost can not get a government contract what action will the minister take to ensure that new firm include new small and medium sized enterprise can actually get contract and keep job in the uk 
 i absolutely agree that we need to support sme which be why we set target for all departments on sme and voluntary community and social enterprise spend it be why we be review the rule to make it easy for sme to get on to government contract and why we be consult on new plan to set target for the entire public sector on sme spend 
 early this year the government publish their national procurement policy statement give that economic growth be this government ’s no mission will the minister update the house on how the new approach to procurement will ensure we deliver economic growth in every corner of this country especially in the central belt forth valley and falkirk 
 i really welcome the house ’s continue enthusiasm and support for procurement we have listen to that and be take it seriously which be why we set out as i say a couple of week ago further change to procurement rule to respond to all those point about support sme support british job and support british skill 
 can the minister confirm the amount of money that have be save as a result of the change i bring in to the equality diversity and inclusion guidance in the civil service will he also say if he will be maintain those change or do he seek to overturn that policy 
 i be not seek to overturn that but we want to have a system where we uphold the equality law that apply to the civil service just as it apply throughout the public sector 
 far to the answer give by the paymaster general regard the contaminated blood inquiry i welcome that he will update the house when he have have an opportunity to digest yesterday ’s report but can i have an assurance from he that it will not be on the last sitting day before recess 
 i may be in the hand of mr speaker so i will certainly not tread on to which day i will be permit to do so but definitely before the summer recess 
 mr speaker as you be well aware bridlington be the lobster capital of europe so there be understandable outrage at the recent government decision to sell out the uk fishing industry for the next year in return for a sanitary and phytosanitary deal that be yet to be negotiate be that just another example of the shambolic way this government do business 
 no absolutely not what we have of all be a multi year deal with stability which will give the opportunity for investment the government will then invest £ in coastal community and update the fleet if the hon gentleman be oppose to that he should say so surely he be not and the sps agreement will allow our catch to be sell far more easily to the eu by the way of our catch currently go to the eu he should be welcome that 
 i welcome the uk eu reset which will help to bring down energy bill and grocery bill i also welcome the government ’s new procurement plan bournemouth east have fantastic talent particularly among our young population will the minister outline how the new procurement plan will both help to give those young people opportunity and secure clean power in the south west 
 we have set out plan to strengthen and streamline social value so that we be absolutely clear about the expectation on business to support job skill and opportunity namely opportunity for our young people to get into good quality work in community like my hon friend ’s 
 i think the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and i be politically completely at    because if it be down the of we we would relocate all civil servant to wolverhampton and staffordshire what be also incredibly important be minister be in those office will he commit to publish the detail of ministerial attendance in office outside london include how long they stay in those office 
 i be not sure i will while ministers should attend on occasion minister have to be in a certain place just to keep up with a publish record be not the good use of their time i very much welcome civil servant work in wolverhampton the cabinet office have a fantastic building in glasgow which i have enjoy visit and work in on several occasion 
 i be disappoint that the uk government do not go ahead with proposal for a glasgow campus for uk government office reason behind that proposal be upgrade the facility available to foreign commonwealth and development office staff who be locate at abercrombie house in east kilbride which have be assess as lack the facility require to be a fcdo headquarters will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster work with the fcdo to ensure that that investment go into abercrombie house so that it can be a headquarters 
 if the right hon gentleman ’s ambition be to move the staff out of east kilbride he should perhaps have a word with my hon friend   the member for east kilbride and strathaven joani reid we have good location in both glasgow and east kilbride and we welcome they both to refer to the previous question i recently spend time work in the east kilbride office i hope that it be a good home for civil servant for some time to come 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on the uk france nuclear partnership 
 the uk and france have a proud history of co operation on defence nuclear matter alongside our conventional warfighting capability the independent strategic nuclear force of the uk and france contribute significantly to the overall security of the nato alliance and the euro atlantic since we have state that we do not see situation arise in which the vital interest of could be threaten without the vital interest of the other also be threaten in both nation agree to share research facility and co operate on nuclear technology under the lancaster house treaty in at chatham house the defence secretary set out the importance of reboot lancaster house and our defence relationship with france that be reaffirm in our manifesto 
 today the prime minister and president emmanuel macron will agree to deepen their nuclear co operation and work more closely than ever before on nuclear deterrence that be an important step forward for the uk france nuclear partnership and reflect the significant improvement in the relationship between our country that this government have drive a soon to be sign declaration will state for the time that the respective deterrent of both country be independent but can be co ordinated the declaration will also affirm that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt a response by both nation as such any adversary threaten the vital interest of britain or france could be confront by the strength of the nuclear force of both nation co operation between our country on nuclear research will also deepen while we work together to uphold the international non proliferation architecture further detail will follow today ’s agreement 
 in an increasingly volatile and complex global security environment exemplify by russia ’s war of aggression in ukraine a war on the european continent the uk and france as europe ’s nuclear power be unite in our determination to work close than ever before on nuclear deterrence that be a manifesto commitment a promise make and a promise keep and yet another example of how the government be deliver for defence 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker i do think it be incredible that we have have to find out about such substantive matter overnight from the press and without a statement from the government 
 we conservative back our nuclear deterrent and have never waver on that we support step that boost the resilience of our nuclear enterprise diversify delivery and above all help our core continuous at sea deterrence to remain the cornerstone of our homeland defence against the most extreme threat we also welcome step to genuinely strengthen uk french co operation on defence build on lancaster house in particular have be the government who authorise provision   of long range storm shadow missile to ukraine we recognise the urgent need to replenish our own storm shadow stock which be in the press release can the minister confirm whether we be place order for new storm shadow missile from mbda or simply recondition exist stock 
 the nuclear aspect of this be by far the most significant can the minister confirm where this will leave the operationally independent and sovereign nature of our exist trident nuclear deterrent the telegraph quote the declaration which of course we have not see as say that both nuclear arsenal 
 remain independent but can be co ordinated and that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt a response by both nation 
 do this mean that our respective national deterrence will now be jointly operationally deliver and how will that co ordination take place in practice crucially how do this new nuclear doctrine affect nato and our very close co operation on nuclear deterrence with the united states will france now be offer its nuclear deterrent to nato as we do perhaps most importantly will france be join the nato nuclear planning group 
 on the matter of tactical nuclear weapon i have previously ask about option other than us control gravity bomb with no reply give the announcement on storm shadow and mbda will the uk and france now be look at co operation on tactical nuclear delivery option via our share complex weapon industrial base a particular concern of the opposition be that there appear to be a deep paradox at play here talk of close co operation with france but in the background the government still get nowhere on access to hard cash from the european rearmament fund despite have give up our sovereign fishing ground 
 to conclude it be truly extraordinary that such significant defence development do not warrant a government statement so the minister must now be as transparent as possible in answer our question not least after week dominate by smoke and mirror on defence spending and chaotic u turn on welfare that raise the most profound question of all where be the money go to come from 
 there have not be a statement yet because the agreement have not be sign yet in fact 
 you ’re brief it to the press 
 if the right hon gentleman would like to listen to the reply the agreement have not be sign yet i be sure that as soon as it be sign 
 but it have be brief to the press 
 i be sure that as soon as it be signed—[interruption the shadow minister have ask his question i would like to try to answer they without he heckle i too much although it be up to he how he behave 
 no it will be up to i 
 indeed 
 the shadow minister ask whether the idea that we should work more closely with france have any implication for the independence of trident and he refer to the phrase 
 independent but can be co ordinated 
 the answer be no our casd operation be entirely unaffected this be not a new nuclear doctrine on behalf of the uk our nuclear doctrine be the same as it ever have be the use of our nuclear deterrent in any circumstance can only be authorise by the prime minister and that remain the case the french have their own arrangement for how they authorise theirs it be a matter for they this agreement imply no co ordination in that respect 
 the agreement say that there be an opportunity when vital interest be affect for co ordination between both nation in the way in which they respond that just strengthen the power of the deterrent across europe when nation that be nuclear power can co ordinate their response it strengthen the deterrent against our potential enemy by make it clear that the nation will act in co ordination rather than entirely separately 
 the shadow minister ask whether the agreement have any implication for our deterrent still be dedicate to nato it do not our deterrent be of course still dedicate to the defence of nato he refer again to tactical nuclear delivery option i do not know whether he mean tactical nuclear weapon development this government do not see any use of any kind of nuclear weapon as tactical and we be not propose in this agreement to develop any new kind of nuclear weapon it be about co ordinate the option that we have together to make europe and the north atlantic strong 
 i welcome today ’s agreement that be in train as a powerful signal that britain be once again step up to be a reliable european ally with deep uk france co ordination on nuclear deterrence mark a step change in how we engage with our close partner this be not just a diplomatic milestone it have real potential to reset relation strengthen european security and drive long term investment into our industrial base as the keen champion of our sovereign capability and resilient supply chain particularly in my constituency may i ask the minister how this partnership will be use to maximise opportunity for uk industry ensure that we can build the skill infrastructure and capacity that be need to keep our deterrent credible for decade to come 
 the effort on co ordinate our nuclear deterrence between the uk and france be in the context of a refresh of the lancaster house treaty which also include provision about co ordinate our conventional force and co ordinating effort through our industry to ensure that we can manufacture new and future proof complex weapon that will assist in deter potential adversary who would threaten europe this be in the context of an entire refreshed agreement that should strengthen our conventional force as well as our capacity for co ordination between our military and of our nuclear deterrence 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats have consistently say that the uk ’s security depend on deep defence co operation with our european ally so we welcome progress but urge the government to go far nuclear co ordination between the uk and france can help to deter putin and support europe ’s collective security that be particularly critical as donald trump have show that our security be no long his concern france cherish the independence of its nuclear system as the minister confirm so will she provide further detail on exactly how the new system of co ordinating nuclear deterrence will work the government must now go far so will the minister update the house on whether the government have secure full access for uk defence firm to the eu security action for europe fund as putin escalate his attack against civilian target in kyiv and other city we must work with our ally to support ukraine will the government use today ’s coalition of the willing talk to agree on how the uk and france can seize russia ’s frozen asset that be hold in our country 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his support for deep defence co operation on the co ordination of our nuclear deterrence there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt a response by our nation but france and the uk remain sovereign nuclear weapon state and their respective nuclear force and decision make process be independent there will be increase co ordination of research and development and of the co operation that we have be engage in since the chequers announcement of that will be deepen and a co ordinating committee between the élysée and the cabinet office will be the joint arrangement for decide precisely how and what extra research or training we might do there will be increase co ordination of that effort but i stress that our decision make arrangement remain completely independent both nation recognise that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt a response by our nation our vital interest be the same in that respect 
 on security action for europe and access to eu fund negotiation be ongoing but not complete would hope that progress can be make i can not recall the hon gentleman ’s point 
 the coalition of the willing 
 i have nothing furth to say on that today as the hon gentleman would probably expect in a response to an urgent question on nuclear co ordination 
 be the minister as surprised as i be to find that the shadow secretary of state only half quote that sentence from the report in navy lookout about make it clear that no extreme threat to european security would go unanswered by both country but fail to look at the real purpose here that it signal a strengthen deterrence posture as russia have repeat its threat to use nuclear weapon do my hon friend agree that this show that the relationship which be damage by brexit be now be recreate by this government the aukus pact and defence co operation be now a clear priority for this government with the european union and that be embody in this new relationship with france 
 i suppose i should say that i be surprised that the shadow secretary of state for defence only quote half the sentence if indeed that be the case but he be probably not the opposition spokesperson to do that in the history of oppositions in this house i agree with my hon friend that what we have here be a strengthening of the deterrent across europe which will help to deter potential adversary from conduct themselves in a way that might threaten the future of our nation 
 i welcome the announcement of strengthen collaboration with france although read between the line it sound like co ordination be actually submarine patrol deconfliction our aerial participation in the nato nuclear mission be still a decade away with the completion of f-35a delivery not schedule until accord to the government but both the french air force and marine nationale be arm with the air sol moyenne portée amélioré asmpa medium range supersonic nuclear tip missile as part of their force de dissuasion be that nuclear strike capability within the scope of this agreement if so how will it be incorporate into our own nuclear doctrine will it be an escalation step prior to the use of trident do this form an interim solution while we await the capability to fully participate in the nato nuclear mission how will command of it work 
 the hon gentleman complain about the amount of time it have take this government to do thing in respect of defence but we have to pick up the mess that be leave by his government who be in office for year it be a bit of a cheek for he to complain about delay when the reality be that his own government do nothing for year i have make it quite clear that our defence nuclear posture be not change and that we be not seek to acquire new and different nuclear weapon but if the vital interest of the uk and france be engage and threaten we will co ordinate our nuclear response as a result of this agreement and that provide a great deterrent 
 a much strong relationship between the uk and france in this area will require a deepening of our commercial collaboration in our respective industrial basis particularly in the supply chain will the minister comment on how the government ’s own procurement policy will help to support this collaboration particularly as it might benefit company in the teesside defence and innovation cluster 
 my hon friend be correct the refresh of the lancaster house treaty be about not just nuclear co operation but co operation between our conventional force and great co operation and effort between our industry bilaterally to provide we with thing like complex weapon in a way that will deter and enable we to defend ourselves at threshold well below any nuclear threshold any increase in defence spending as we be see do give more opportunity for our own industry whether those company be offer novel or dual use technology or be our traditional big prime any increase offer more opportunity for all of they to help we in our rearmament 
 i understand that the ink may not yet be dry on this agreement so clearly the minister can answer only on what she be   aware of at the moment however she mention the use of a committee to make decision who will chair that committee what will its membership be how will decision be make if there be a disagreement between our ally in france and ourselves 
 our respective national authority will remain responsible for plan and conduct operation a uk france nuclear steering group will be establish to provide political direction for increased co ordination across nuclear policy capability and operation that will be joint between the élysée which have authority over nuclear matter in france and the cabinet office which will co ordinate with it obviously with input from the ministry of defence 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s response and great collaboration between the uk and france with this nuclear partnership it not only enhance our nation ’s security but have the potential to deliver highly skilled and highly pay job to every nation and region across our country will she say a little more about how those benefit will be realise in scotland 
 my hon friend be correct the strategic defence review and our ongoing commitment to increase defence spending in this country give opportunity for our industry to benefit obtain contract and assist we in ensure that we can defend our nation and nato more fully and in a well way go forward there will be job skilled opportunity and growth in all part of the nation and region of the uk 
 the threat and nuclear sabre rattle that we have hear from president putin since russia ’s full scale invasion of ukraine be utterly unacceptable and the response from the british and french government have be robust for i defence co operation between the uk and france be always welcome will our government also seek to get a reaffirmation from other p5 country include russia of the reagan gorbachev formula that 
 a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his support for this extra co ordination the aim of all this be to make sure that nato and europe be safe from the threat that may come from putin and his nuclear sabre rattle as the hon gentleman refer to we believe that deter those threat be the good way to ensure that we do not end up have to fight a war that would be catastrophic that be where we be at present i be not sure that president putin be in the mood to agree that nuclear war can not be win because he do issue nuclear threat every now and then we need to ensure that he be deter in his approach 
 the bedrock of our national defence be our own sovereign capability and our membership of nato the united kingdom and france be both member of nato but as the shadow secretary of state point out the paradox be that we and every other nato member bar be member of the nato nuclear planning group of course that bar be france as part of these   discussion be france go to join the nato nuclear planning group if not how on earth will this co ordination work within that partnership 
 i be not here to speak for the french government as far as i be concern our nuclear posture have not change their nuclear posture be a matter for they what this agreement say be that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt a response by our nation and although we both independently look after and be responsible for our deterrence we believe that co ordinating potential response in this way provide a great deterrent for europe and nato that be the basis of this agreement 
 clearly our deep and close relationship on nuclear deterrence be with the united states of america can the minister confirm how this agreement will affect that relationship which be crucial for our security 
 the agreement do not change our very close relationship with the americans in line with the nato strategic concept the strategic force of the us the uk and france all contribute significantly to the overall security of the alliance there be no reason why that should not continue to be the case 
 rise 
 rise 
 i call jim shannon 
 thank you very much mr speaker i always expect to be call last but i have just jump in ahead of my colleague and friend   the hon member for south antrim robin swann 
 i thank the minister for her answer today we very much welcome the news that we be to enhance our nuclear programme that security can only be good for our whole nation however the estimate i have read still put our nuclear capability well below the threat pose by russia so how can we continue to build our nuclear capability and how can northern ireland play a    part in that work the minister be always committed to help northern ireland so i be very keen to hear how that will work 
 the hon gentleman be usually last but never least and he be not even last on this occasion 
 i agree that it be important that we strengthen the credibility of our deterrence which be why we be commit to build the replacement boat that will carry our continuous at sea deterrent and up to ssn through ssn aukus we be double the drumbeat of our construction of submarine over time which i think send a pretty powerful signal to potential adversary that our casd and our capacity to defend and to use it be go to be significantly strengthen over the come period i be glad to say that i have find general support for that in this house which i welcome 
 the minister reference the political steering group that will be set up between the nation be there any concern either within government or within the ministry of defence about share intelligence with a separate political steering group that will sit outside of or adjacent to nato 
 the steering group be about political policymaking rather than intelligence i be sure that appropriate arrangement will be establish if there be any such issue but i do not anticipate that there will be a problem 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 a point of order relevant to this debate 
 indeed may i seek your guidance on how to set the record straight follow the question from   the hon member for brent west barry gardiner the minister criticise the fact that i only partially refer to a quote from the declaration text to be clear i have not see the declaration it be leak to the medium overnight that be all i could read from and i be none the wiser from the answer we have just have 
 order please we can not keep the debate go you have make the point and it be on the record let we move on 
 will the leader of the house give the house the forthcoming business

 tuesday july the sir david amess summer adjournment debate the subject for this debate be determine by the backbench business committee 
 the house will rise for the summer recess at the conclusion of business on   tuesday july   and return on   monday september 
 i call the shadow leader of the house 
 i be not go to let this moment pass i be sure no colleague would wish i to without again remind everyone present that this week mark the anniversary of the bombing on   july people be kill in separate attack and more be injure many of they grievously i know that the whole house will want to join i in mourn the victim of these dreadful crime and in send all our good wish to their family and love one 
 while we be on the subject of anniversary the house will need no reminding that be year since simon de montfort convene the representative parliament perhaps even more significantly this year mark year since the year when the charter we now know as magna carta be agree as a statute and indeed become the of all our statute to that extent it be and not that should be recognise as the birth date of magna carta interruption i be pleased to hear that wide array of support from the house thank you i think it be an important point to put on the record 
 for the government of course the past week mark an anniversary of a somewhat less glorious and happy kind their full year in office as a house it fall to we to ask how the government have do it would be right to focus in the place on their shockingly negligent and abusive treatment of our northern ireland veteran but that be the topic of a westminster hall debate next monday so let we focus on wide issue 
 labour pledge to deliver the high economic growth in the g7 in reality uk growth have fail even to beat the g7 average labour promise to meet nhs waiting list target for of patient but the current figure stand at 59.8%—just percentage point well than a year ago labour vow to smash the boat and the boat gang yet small boat migrant number be up by almost compare with this time last year perhaps we can forget the pledge 
 how then be the uk economy actually do well we know that the office for budget responsibility have cut its growth forecast to just inflation be high than a year ago and unemployment stand at its high for year so diminish be the government ’s stand in international market that the institute for fiscal studies recently point out that the uk now face high borrowing cost than almost all comparable country it be full percentage point high than germany and high even than greece and italy 
 i be afraid to say that the government have store up more pain to come the junior doctor have now vote in favour of further strike through the autumn and into the new year they have a increase last year the house will recall and they be now look to their labour brother and sister for a scarcely believable further that be before we include their pension the secretary of state for health and social care have as the wildly overrated aneurin bevan say in stuff their mouth with gold and they be already come back for more 
 what have the medium reaction be to all this internationally the economist describe the prime minister ’s year as waste time call it a catalogue of error the normally sympathetic new york times comment that britain ’s prime minister be 
 fade away before our eye 
 even supportive british newspaper have not be able to disguise their dismay the financial times have bewail labour ’s drift and the guardian its lack of vision”—not my word but those of some of the most respected newspaper in the world 
 finally what do the poor suffer public make of all this we know what a laser focus those in downing street keep on the poll and it will not have escape their notice that the prime minister ’s approval rating be now at no government in recent time have ever lose public support after an election fast than this how mortify the prime minister must be to be wrench back almost weekly from the perfumed chancery of europe to the grimmer reality of domestic politic 
 we need not dwell on the piety and pomposity of labour ’s pronouncement about stability and trust before the july election these be the fact they speak for themselves and they say only this must do well a lot well 
 may i join the shadow leader of the house in mark the anniversary of the bombing we all remember that day well and i be sure that the   whole house will want to remember all those who die and those who be affect by it 
 may i also take this opportunity to welcome the newly announce new director of the independent complaints and grievance scheme the highly qualified miriam minty who will be start in september 
 as the shadow leader of the house say this week we welcome the french president to the uk for a state visit i think his address to both houses on tuesday be excellent and historic and i thank you mr speaker your team and all those involve in organise it i think that it underline the deep and endure relationship between our great country the visit conclude today with a summit and i will ensure that the house be update at the early opportunity on any agreement that we come to as part of that 
 i have to say it be a bit gall that week in week out the right hon gentleman raise the propose strike action by junior doctor which be extremely disappointing we do not think strike action be necessary give that the nhs be finally move in the right direction strike would put that recovery at risk affect patient and let down our collective obligation to those we be here to serve we have deliver a very generous pay settlement but we be keen to work constructively the health secretary ’s door remain open he will be in the house shortly 
 our approach be very different from that which the conservatives leave we they leave the nhs on its knee with waiting list at a record high and with over half a appointment and operation cancel due to strike action in just year and it be not just the doctor the rail strike cost the economy over £ the teacher strike lose teaching day in year and the conservatives go to war with public sector worker week in week out i do notice though that the leader of the opposition be today give a speech in which she will talk about the tick time bomb that have be leave too right there be a tick time bomb it be the conservatives tick time bomb we all know that they leave mine all over the place and we be have to sweep they out 
 the right hon gentleman want to know how our year in office be go and i be happy to tell he we promise extra nhs appointment and we have deliver a more than that we say that we would get waiting list down and they be come down month on month interest rate be come down net migration be come down from a record high under the conservatives we have secure trade deal trade deal that they once hail but never deliver and we have get they go we have create nearly new job since the election we have recruit an extra new police officer we have build nearly new home establish great british energy extend the warm home discount to more household expand free school meal for half a more child and open free breakfast club we have ban bonus for water boss who have be pollute our river and wage grow more in our month in office than they do in the conservative last year in office i be happy to debate he any time on our record and i thank he for the opportunity to do so today 
 i do feel slightly sorry for the shadow leader of the house when come here week in and week out it be just go from bad to bad for the conservative party be it not perhaps that be why he go so deep into history in his question because he do not want to talk about recent history he be of the up this morning after let we be honest a big defection overnight the late in a long line of those flee the sink ship personally i would not put have put jake berry good friend of boris johnson and former chair of the conservative party down as a likely defector it really be that bad for the conservatives however i could not have put it well myself when jake say 
 we ’ve get a conservative party that do n’t seem to know what it stand for any more the conservatives have lose their way they ’ve abandon their principle they ’ve abandon the british people 
 he be right be n’t he 
 have say that and we can not pass this by that defection do not make up for what have be a terrible week for the reform party especially when it come to shall we say hr matter the big story for reform this week be that it really be become the party of sleaze and scandal and of dud and dodgy personnel i do not think this be really the right moment for it to start ditch its vetting procedure even though it have only a handful of mps its chief whip seem to have have a busy week than our and that be say something i be not sure if reform will welcome our partnership with the french on tackle the small boat this week but it be already enthusiastically implement a policy of in out
