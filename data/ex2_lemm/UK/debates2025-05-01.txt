 what recent step his department have take to encourage small business to export 
 what recent step his department have take to encourage small business to export 
 we have begin a series of roadshow which bring overseas buyer to the uk to meet small business here in for example clean energy advanced manufacturing life science technology and digital creative financial and professional service in addition we be offer new online support to help small and medium sized enterprise win new export order to eu market 
 i know from a recent business roundtable i host in my constituency of bathgate and linlithgow and from many meeting with industry that a common barrier to small business export be supply chain instability in the past few year we have see massive instability include from the impact of the pandemic and now from the announcement of tariff disrupt demand forecasting increase cost of raw material and uncertainty be damage fledgling business in grow their export what specific measure be the department implement to help small business navigate these challenge and to ensure they can maintain reliable supply chain as we enter another turbulent time for international trade 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and i commend she for the business roundtable that she host she be absolutely right and we recognise that supply chain instability be a critical issue for business we be therefore work hard to minimise the uncertainty that business face both in export and in purchase from key market whether through the economic deal with the us that we be seek to negotiate the reset of our relationship with the eu or new opportunity with   india and the indo pacific we be keen to take down barrier to business i have to say that the evidence continue to demonstrate that free and fair trade drive down price offer well choice for consumer and crucially lead to more stable supply chain 
 i recently visit phoenox textiles in denby dale a family run business that proudly continue our community ’s heritage in the sector it raise the concern that while it operate a to landfill operation low quality unsustainable import from chinese seller such as temu undercut its business and the local growth that it sustain how be the government address this concern and what be they do to support british business 
 i commend the work of phoenox textiles and my hon friend for champion its concern because of the concern she have articulate which we have hear from across the retail sector i have certainly hear it from member of the retail sector council my right hon friend the secretary of state recently meet the trade remedies authority to agree urgent step to prevent the dumping of cheap good in the uk there will be increase support for business to report unfair practice and my right hon friend the chancellor be also review the custom treatment of low value import 
 last year our trade deficit be £ and apart from during the pandemic we have run a deficit every year since do the minister agree that the trade deficit bring severe economic consequence and be it government policy to reduce it over the course of this parliament 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the fact that we need to increase export to all sort of market it be of the reason why we be take urgent step to agree a new deal with the us why we be seek to reset our relationship with the eu and why we be keen to open up new opportunity through a free trade agreement with india and new opportunity in the indo pacific when he serve in a senior role under a previous prime minister his party take decision to cut support for exporter we be look at what we can do to help exporter move forward 
 the minister will know that meriden and solihull east be proud to be the home of jaguar land rover jlr the supply chain and the small business in it be crucial not just for the constituency but in export i have write to the secretary of state ask for a meeting and i be very willing to work with the government on this i recently visit washington and speak to congress people about the damage that tariff can do what be the minister do to help not just jlr but those small business and how we can work together 
 i know my right hon friend the secretary of state be urgently seek to arrange the meeting with the hon member to discuss this issue because we recognise that this be a key concern of the automotive sector as i have say we be seek to negotiate an economic deal with the us but we be also look to work with the automotive industry to increase   export of car and other thing that they produce across all sort of new market of the roadshow we be organise for small business be about that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government be far from support small business to export business of every size up and down the country be fail at a rate not see since the financial crash when labour be last in power confidence be slump family business be close millionaire be flee the country and that be before tariff hit what representation be the minister make to the chancellor about reverse some of the measure that hit business in her hallowe’en budget 
 i have think that of the contribution from the opposition front benchers today would be to celebrate the £ investment by ikea in the uk it be open its flagship store on oxford street today and commit to a range of investment in other town and city across the uk when the hon lady be on the treasury committee i do not know whether she look at the cut the previous government make to help for small business in get their good into new market we be take active step to increase the opportunity for small business in overseas market 
 what step his department be take to negotiate trade agreement with the uk ’s main trading partner 
 i announce in july that we be resume free trade agreement negotiation with the gulf co operation council india israel the republic of korea switzerland and türkiye we have also begin talk with the united states on an economic prosperity deal and we support the cabinet office with trade aspect of the eu reset 
 give the utter unreliability and frankly economic illiteracy of president trump and give that the eu be by far our large trading partner it be clear that the good interest of the uk be serve by our have a deal that allow the close possible co ordination with the eu do the minister agree with i that that should cover youth mobility and improve energy and climate co operation specifically will he work with his colleague to ensure that we ease burden for british business by link the uk and eu emission trading scheme and by align on chemical regulation to boost british productivity and prosperity 
 i think that be a few question but we seem to have time for they today so i welcome all of they of all i recognise exactly what the hon lady say when it come to the importance of the eu as a principal trading partner for this country the figure speak for themselves i disagree with she about we have to choose between the us and the eu or any other market i believe that the uk can be well position for all market there will be strong political view in this place about political leader in a range of   country but i would just say to she that when it come to the united states there be potentially thousand of job at stake that be why we be pursue a trade and economic prosperity deal with the us and i think we can not get away from that 
 on the question relate to the eu a successful negotiation take party i want to see great co operation i would not talk about the specific of any part of the negotiation but i would not want the kind of barrier that she identify to be in place i want the uk to have the good and most frictionless trade possible with the eu in a way that be consistent with our aspiration and obligation with the rest of the world but she have make her point very well and i recognise it 
 i declare an interest as the trade envoy to new zealand what conversation have the secretary of state have recently with his new zealand counterpart on the implementation of the uk new zealand free trade agreement 
 let i thank my hon friend for all her work as our trade envoy to new zealand she know because she be present that on his visit to the uk new zealand prime minister luxon spend the day with the prime minister and i be able to spend considerable time with he in the afternoon we discuss the implementation of the uk new zealand fta as well as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the importance of work together to support free trade and to protect a rule base trading system we be work to ensure that business be use the fta to support the government ’s growth agenda and the plan for change later this month we will host the uk new zealand fta joint committee which will discuss continue to grow uk and new zealand trade 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be good to hear that the trade negotiation with india which begin when we be in government be progress well there must surely now be an opportunity to reopen talk with canada so it can buy more wonderful cheese from the uk with the tariff clock ticking i be sure the secretary of state recognise that the us deal be the most urgent many uk job be at risk however we hear recently from the chancellor when she be in the states that her big priority be discussion with the eu where we already have tariff and quota do the secretary of state share the chancellor ’s priority or do he think the us be more urgent 
 i thank the hon lady for the early part of her comment she be right that we want the previous government to secure the india fta and we be willing to support they fully in do that but they be unable to get it across the line with canada there be issue particularly around agriculture that be similar to those involve the us so that may be more of a challenging negotiation 
 the entirety of this government however have be clear that we be not seek to pick between market and another both be absolutely fundamental the chancellor ’s comment specifically relate to the   simple truth that there be a much great quantum of uk eu trade than uk us trade equally though in all these negotiation we have to focus on not just what can be do quickly but what can be do right and in the national interest there be no point secure an agreement that do not deliver on our objective no matter whom that agreement be with 
 we will welcome any support from the conservatives for the work we be try to do i do believe it be easy politically for this government to do some trade agreement that be available to the uk some may not have be politically available to the conservative government we will continue to do that work and we welcome all support for it from across the house 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday i ask the prime minister whether parliament will get a final vote on any trade deal negotiate with the united states and the prime minister state that it would go through the know process that process do not include a vote for mps on the ratification of any trade deal will the secretary of state therefore make it explicitly clear with a yes or no whether mps will get a final vote on the deal with the united states the pm ’s answer yesterday imply that we would not 
 the answer as the hon gentleman know be no we be not in this government seek to change the ratification process for any treaty he know the process and how it work the constitutional reform and governance act set out that process it allow mp to scrutinise any treaty agree with a country and present to the house the implementation of any aspect of any treaty still have to come to parliament of course it be not the case that any agreement on any kind of international treaty can supersede what we agree in this place in that process all member of parliament get the same right and privilege quite rightly but no we be not propose change to the process by which we agree treaty with other country 
 what step his department be take to help support trade with european country 
 as we have just be discuss increase trade with european country be and have be a focus of discussion between ministers in the department for business and trade and their eu counterpart i recently meet ministers from spain france denmark poland and germany and work be under way on the uk eu summit schedule to take place on   may trade and the economy will form element of a broad agenda about our strategic partnership across wide europe we be negotiate an enhance free trade agreement with switzerland which we hope will strengthen our trading relationship there 
 the uk ’s economic relationship with sweden be among the most important of our economic relationship with our european partner particularly with sweden have recently join nato   as the minister will know babcock be pursue a partnership with saab to build luleå class corvette for sweden that would involve significant work at rosyth dockyard and secure thousand of job in my constituency this would be a joint export product bring considerable further value to the uk give the significance of this deal to my constituency and shipbuilding in the uk will the minister confirm its importance to our relationship with sweden and do all that he can to support and champion this vital defence industrial partnership 
 have work so closely with former prime minister gordon brown over a number of year i be probably the last person in this chamber who need to be convince of the economic significance of the rosyth dockyard as my hon friend know i have recently have meeting with babcock ’s executive team both in london and abroad due to commercial sensitivity i can not discuss detail of the deal to which he have refer i be grateful for his recent letter to the secretary of state on this matter a response be issue yesterday he can be fully assure that the government value the defence relationship with sweden and fully recognise the importance of defence industrial partnership between the united kingdom and swedish company they contribute greatly to our defence and growth objective 
 food and drink be of scotland ’s most successful industry and it be worth £ to the economy over the come month the uk government face a choice in their trade talk with the eu and us do we align our food and farming standard with those in the eu or reduce our quality standard at the behest of the united states will the secretary of state guarantee that scotland ’s food and drink industry will not be jeopardise through desperation to satisfy the demand of and secure a deal with donald trump 
 at exactly this point tomorrow morning i will be visit a farm in east lothian so i can assure the hon gentleman that i be fully aware of the importance of food and agriculture to the scottish economy and more broadly to the uk economy i also respectfully refer he to the labour manifesto at the last general election which make very clear our commitment to maintain important standard 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the product regulation and metrology bill which be about to start its committee stage in the house may sound a little dry but it would give the secretary of state unfettered power to sign up to dynamic alignment with the european union at the summit give that voter be go to the poll today will the minister take the opportunity at the dispatch box to rule out the uk become an eu rule taker 
 i be slightly worried that the question add and and get about the bill recognise that we have to find a way forward on standard with the european union but to try to overlay what be as the shadow minister say a necessary and somewhat dry technical piece of legislation with the policy agenda that she allude to be simply wrong 
 what step he be take to include the chemical sector within the industrial strategy 
 the industrial strategy have identify key growth drive sector that will be the arrowhead of our economic success but of course they can not succeed without the critical supply chain and foundational industry that underpin they we be look at all those foundational industry include the chemical industry to see what the barrier to growth be what challenge they face and how can we overcome they through our strategy 
 i very much welcome the minister ’s recognition of the chemical sector ’s contribution as a foundational sector and an anchor employer in constituency such as mine we have the dow site there what can we do to support the deeply integrate supply chain across the uk and europe that the chemical sector and dow in particular rely on 
 i do not want to underestimate the challenge that the chemical sector face between and uk chemical manufacturing fall in real term by about a we be work to improve the uk ’s trade and investment relationship with the eu we want to build export and investment opportunity and reduce barrier to trade conversation be at an early stage so i will not go into specific but we be certainly work to help the chemical industry 
 what assessment have the minister make of the benefit that inclusion of the chemical sector among the sector could bring for our national security and our pharmaceutical sector how can all region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland benefit from this sector 
 when we look at the sector that we be try to turbocharge through the industrial strategy we see that the chemical sector underpin so many other sector we need to make sure that we protect it as i have just say chemical manufacturing have fall by nearly a over the past year we need to turn that around we be look at what we can do to break down barrier and make improvement for example on the cost of energy that be part of the mix when it come to make sure that we be secure in the future 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality industry 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality industry 
 hospitality business be vital to our community and to economic growth in   the uk which be why we plan to introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property with rateable value of less than £ in addition we recently hold our licensing taskforce meeting which aim to reduce red tape for the sector next thursday on ve day pub and bar across the country will be able to stay open until late to enable everyone to celebrate all those who serve during the world war 
 pub and the hospitality industry be by their very nature seasonal business and rely heavily on flexible work pattern i see this at hand when be serve by many young staff on my recent pub tour of the constituency why be the minister through the power in the employment rights bill seek to end the flexible contract that benefit these young people which will end up cause pub to have to close 
 i gently remind the hon gentleman of the dismal record of the conservatives when it come to support for the hospitality sector pub close between and the employment rights bill will not have the effect that he describe the bill will help to put money into people ’s pocket which be exactly what we need to do to help the hospitality industry go forward 
 in my constituency pub and brewery contribute £ to the local economy and support job as highlight by the british beer and pub association the sector face a disproportionate business rate burden with pub pay a high share relative to their turnover so will the government commit to increase the upper threshold of small business rate relief in order that these iconic british institution continue to thrive 
 i certainly take the hon member ’s broad point about the significance of business rate to the hospitality sector particularly pub i have hear strong representation from the industry about the need for business rate reform the hon member will be delighted that this government have instigate significant business rate reform which previous government over the last year do not do include a permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure 
 resident in buchlyvie in my constituency be lose their only pub which be be turn into holiday let this come despite the objection of local resident and stirling council ’s planning panel refuse the change of use application the scottish government ’s planning reporter have step in and make what many local people think be a short sighted decision do the minister agree that local village pub like library and community centre be vital to local wellbeing and cohesion and that we should do all we can to help they thrive as key part of our local economy and social infrastructure 
 i completely agree with my hon friend about the significance of pub across the uk particularly in rural community such as those he represent it be reason why we be in the final throe of agree extra funding for the great organisation pub be   the hub which support pub in rural area to adapt to change need and enable they to continue to be the vital social hub that they be in community i hope that the scottish government will have hear my hon friend ’s comment and will recognise the need to follow the uk government ’s line and instigate significant business rate reform certainly they need to look at provision on business rate relief which be not as generous in scotland thank to their decision as here in the uk thank to the generosity of our chancellor 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in a grave and exceptionally rare step major business group include the confederation of british industry make uk the institute of directors and the federation of small businesses have all write to condemn the employment rights bill and their view be share by ukhospitality and many other they say that the bill will damage growth and employment i know that and the minister know that this bill will hurt business every business tell i this and they be tell he exactly the same do the secretary of state think that be why so many of his ministers be unable to name a single business that support the bill and his government ’s job tax 
 i wonder whether the shadow secretary of state might finally use this set of question to take the opportunity to apologise for help to write the liz truss budget which drive interest rate up time and do more damage to business than any other single measure in recent time we have to take difficult decision to sort out the fiscal inheritance we get and we recognise that to tackle the cost of living crisis that the conservatives bequeath we we need to ensure that there be more money in people ’s pocket the employment rights bill will help to do just that 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs on the potential impact of his trade negotiation with the us on the farming sector 
 i regularly engage with my cabinet colleague on a wide range of issue and in particular the uk ’s ongoing trade discussion with partner country give the cross cutting nature of those matter the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs be a key partner in that process include with the us 
 as colleague know we have have constructive discussion with the us on an economic deal and we remain committed to those talk but we have make it clear that we will only ever sign trade agreement that align with the uk ’s national interest our manifesto be also clear that we will always uphold our high food standard 
 the secretary of state in defra recently appoint baroness batters to lead a profitability review in farming and have set up a farm profitability unit in the department those be welcome and necessary step but it be not entirely unknown for the effort of   government department to undermine those of another so before the secretary of state sign any trade deal with america will he check in with defra and run the rule over what it be do on farm income so that he do not undermine its effort 
 we will all struggle to believe that at time different departments could be well co ordinated i can not recognise that at all 
 i absolutely agree with the right hon gentleman the move to look at the business model around farming and profitability be welcome and i think colleague on both side of the house would support that on matter of trade defra and its secretary of state be closely involve with those conversation 
 perhaps in the past the community have not always feel this but in some of the ongoing trade negotiation that we be progress there be real export opportunity for uk agriculture its quality and the premium and brand associate with that be a market that be grow around the world part of our discussion in a range of different trade negotiation be about ensure that there be more opportunity in future but i promise the right hon gentleman that the overall effort of government in the sector be co ordinated and that be ongoing 
 what step his department be take to help increase export to the eu 
 of our large trading partner be in the european union indeed of uk trade be with our friend neighbour and partner in the eu the department for business and trade along with other departments across government i hope in a co ordinated way have be contribute to the resetting of our relationship with the eu and be fully engage ahead of the uk eu summit schedule to take place on   may among the broad spectrum of policy area we aim to make progress on tackle barrier to trade and secure outcome that will help more business across the uk export to our european neighbour 
 this be a moment for britain to show that it be serious about forge a renewed and reinvigorated relationship with the eu which be still our large trading partner if the forthcoming summit end up as another in a long line of miss opportunity there be a real danger that brussels will just move on to other priority what concrete measure can business expect to come out of the summit to cut red tape and the barrier hold back british growth and prosperity 
 i would be incline to wait for the summit before declaim it as a disaster i think in the trade that be call prebuttal however the hon gentleman ’s point about the seriousness of the summit be a fair and i recognise it when i see those image of the prime minister sit with president trump in the oval office or indeed with president macron or president von der leyen of the european commission i feel a genuine sense of relief that we have a serious   prime minister for these serious time that serious prime minister be intent on rebuild personal relationship across europe and secondly look to identify the area that be transparently win win between ourselves and our friend neighbour and partner in the european union i assure the hon gentleman that there be an ambitious agenda for the summit on the 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government need to deliver measure that will cut red tape for business in wokingham and across the country who want to sell their good to our large trading partner the european union since brexit over piece of paperwork have be add to uk exporter enough paper to wrap around the world nearly time do the minister recognise the scale of that figure how will he ensure that conservative impose red tape for business with europe be cut down 
 we be consciously pursue a trade agenda base on datum not on post imperial delusion regrettably the data be pretty devastating on the damage do by how brexit be implement by our predecessor if want to look at academic research the late publication from aston university indicate that a number of small and medium sized business about which we have hear a lot today from opposition members be bury under red tape it be not only those business that have be bury under red tape we have see an increase in the number of civil servant across the united kingdom by more than in recent year that be partly why the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster in the cabinet office be lead our work on rethink the size and shape of the british state the hon gentleman be absolutely right in recognise that we have a responsibility to try and clean up the mess that be what we be do 
 what step he be take to help support high street business 
 we be reform business rate roll out banking hub stamp out late payment empower community to bring vacant property on the high street back into use and begin to tackle the antisocial behaviour and crime that have bedevil the high street over the last decade last month we also announce a licensing taskforce that will recommend way to improve our licensing regime to foster vibrant hospitality the night time economy and cultural industry on the high street 
 a british retail consortium survey this week of major retailer employ half a people find that say that the £ a year employment rights bill will have a negative impact on their business and half say that it would lead to job cut how do the minister expect our high street to cope with that extra cost come on top of high business rate and high national insurance when will the government actually listen to business and to the people create job in this country 
 the conservative party have a rather dismal record on support to worker i gently say to the hon gentleman that most business that do the right thing by their employee support the employment rights bill reason the bill be so important be that it will help put more money into people ’s pocket and that will have a knock on benefit for high street business 
 what step his department be take to support business in rural area 
 rural area offer significant potential for growth and be central to our economy so we be work closely with other government departments include the department for environment food and rural affairs to improve the quality of life for people live and work in rural area later this year we will launch the business growth service which in partnership with the growth hub network in england will make it easy for business include those in rural area to get the information and support that they need to thrive 
 i thank the minister for his answer i be encourage that his department be work with other department 
 there be brilliant vineyard in mid sussex such as bolney wine estate which produce high quality english wine they form a vital part of the rural economy and they also entice domestic and international tourism with the end of the wine duty easement on   february   cause significant concern across the sector what step be the minister take to ensure that the english wine industry be not damage by that and instead can continue to grow and go from strength to strength 
 we recognise that the english wine industry which have go from strength to strength in recent year be a crucial part of the rural economy and of the food and drink offer that the uk can rightly be proud of it be reason that we be seek to increase export of food and drink include help english vineyard to export english wine to a range of market overseas and we will certainly continue to do that 
 what recent discussion he have have with his us counterpart on tariff 
 as we have hear the us be our large single country trading partner with total trade worth £ in represent of total uk trade more than a americans work for uk own business and vice versa we have regular and ongoing constructive negotiation with our us counterpart include some this week on secure a wide economic deal to benefit uk business and our economy in those talk we continually push the case for free and open trade nobody want to see a trade war so our focus be on keep calm and continue to negotiate in the interest of uk business and consumer 
 as the uk ’s top export country the us be a vital partner to many uk business but with trump now report to have make the uk a order priority to asia and with the uk possibly on the verge of give up its brexit freedom in favour of eu alignment how confident be the secretary of state of achieve a comprehensive free trade deal with the us in both good and service 
 let i assuage the hon gentleman ’s concern that be a misreading of how the us be approach these negotiation the us have perhaps more complex issue with some country that will take more bandwidth on its side as i have always say the exist relationship between the uk and the us be incredibly strong reciprocal and mutually beneficial i see far few issue to negotiate to get to that outcome 
 again i would push back on anyone attempt to put the case that the decision we make must be base on either the eu the us or any other partner be our principal partner the role for the uk be to position ourselves in this challenging world with a genuine strategic advantage because we do thing that improve our trading relationship with the eu we secure this us deal and we secure the deal with india the gulf and other key market i be pragmatic about where the uk ’s national interest lie and be absolutely confident that it be possible and desirable 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 today the select committee write to the secretary of state to supply our response to his consultation on how we should respond to american tariff we have hear widespread consensus that there should not be retaliatory tariff and that the approach the government be pursue be right but we have also hear real concern especially in the automotive industry among those big exporter to america and crucially their supply chain can the secretary of state reassure the house that he be ready support package across government to ensure that our automotive sector do not run into serious trouble if we can not get a deal with america soon 
 as my right hon friend know i always welcome communication from the select committee and the constructive and helpful role it play in all these important matter he be right to say that the business community in the uk strongly back the government ’s calm and level head approach to these difficult issue the automotive sector be of our major priority it be the sector that have the most export because of the brilliant success we have with automotive export to the us it remain an absolute priority for we in any negotiation to secure what we need which be the continuation of access to us market in a way that be complementary to the us and that meet the ambition of us consumer frankly i do not see any argument for make that relationship more difficult through the long term imposition of tariff we be closely engage in a number of important meeting this week with senior automotive leader and we will continue to prepare that work to keep the select committee involve 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 when we take office year of conservative neglect have leave our steel industry on the brink but while other be willing to let the heart of british industry go cold we be not i welcome the recent conversion of opposition colleague to an active industrial policy but make no mistake while other may talk tough only labour can be trust to act in the interest of british worker 
 when the future of british steel be on the line we take immediate action i can report to the house that thank to our intervention we have secure the raw material to keep scunthorpe ’s blast furnace light and british steel have cancel the redundancy consultation which put job at risk it be an honour to visit scunthorpe and immingham port recently to meet british steel worker and i be enormously grateful to they for their resilience determination and hard work during a turbulent time 
 there be still much to be do to protect and rebuild our steel industry as a whole after a decade of failure and that be why we be commit to a £ clean steel fund and to work with industry on our steel strategy we have always say that steel have a bright future in this country and our action over the past month have show that we mean it 
 to bring the secretary of state to hampshire and surrey there be major regeneration scheme under way in my constituency at farnham in brightwells and the new town centre in bordon both will ultimately depend on attract physical business be it retail hospitality or otherwise for their long term success do the secretary of state agree that the government should actively support prospective business in those area and do he not recognise that new taxis such as the national insurance contribution increase that his government have impose on business will cause business in my constituency to falter before they have even take off 
 i welcome the progress be make in the hon gentleman ’s constituency i think he be about to invite i there which be often the case at topical question but i sadly do not manage to secure an invitation i have be absolutely clear i genuinely wish the inheritance of this government be a well in economic term than the we receive i genuinely wish the conservative government have not leave that black hole and that we have not have to make difficult decision but life be sometimes about difficult decision and government and business certainly be as well without investment in infrastructure without a serious approach to the fiscal rule which be absent for much of the last government and without investment in the health service we would struggle i welcome the success he be talk about i be always keen to work with he on that 
 pub and restaurant be part of a thriving hospitality sector in my constituency what initiative be the department   planning to support such small business and boost economic growth in colne valley of course i invite the minister to visit my constituency and experience our fantastic hospitality sector 
 the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford   might not invite ministers to his constituency but i be grateful for my hon friend ’s invitation diary permitting i would be delighted to come along last year my right hon friend the secretary of state announce our plan for a business growth service which should make it easy for uk business to get government advice and support in order to grow i hope that will make a real difference in addition we be consider what else we can do to unlock well access to finance for small business such as those in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state say that all the funding require for the nationalisation of british steel will come out of exist budget we have see his department ’s budget we have an estimate day debate in the house not long ago and there be no unallocated pot could he be a little more specific about exactly which budget the money be come from 
 the shadow secretary of state point to the statement in which i say that in the previous budget there be a £ allocation for the green steel fund of course that come in addition to the £ for the port talbot transformation which be agree under the previous government but be not in the departmental account as he know it be in a heavily oversubscribed treasury reserve yes the green steel fund will be there to support what we have have to do at scunthorpe again as i say when parliament be recall the question there be whether we would pay a significant amount of money for the total loss of the business give a large amount of money to jingye but without the certainty that it would be able to deliver on that plan or step in and take the action that we do which i be confident be the right option for value for money and for scunthorpe 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer i think it be widely agree that the cost of nationalise british steel could run into the billion be he really say that he plan to raid the previously allocate £ green steel fund from the national wealth fund and how be he do that give that the national wealth fund be operationally independent be not the truth that soon or later this will have to come from his department ’s budget at the expense of financial support for the automotive sector exporter and hard work trade negotiator 
 i recognise the shadow secretary of state ’s concern but let i reassure he on that point the option available to the government be the total collapse of british steel which would have have an incredible cost to the exchequer of well over £ secondly the request from jingye for £ which the leader of the opposition say   she do or do not agree to in some way with it go to teesside at very significant cost or thirdly as we have do so far the provision of work capital to british steel in order to pay wage and continue the purchase of raw material and the operation of the business of course those cost will be incur by the company because they will enable it to produce and sell steel i will write to he with the detail if he be not confident in the decision that we have make but it be the right decision not just for the steel industry but for the taxpayer 
 wherever possible i think we should buy british and that obviously start with buy british make ceramic may i encourage the department of business and trade to support my ceramics country of origin marking bill which would crack down on cheap import and faker who pass off their product as british ware it be important for the consumer to know that when they buy british the good be make here in the uk 
 i be always keen to support my hon friend and i will certainly consider that legislation we be not a protectionist government we welcome open and free trade but we believe british good can compete on quality and his area be a fine example of that where british good be be undercut not by price and fair competition but by misrepresentation and fraudulent practice we take that seriously and have take more power to deal with it i be sure that he will raise this shortly during the urgent question we will ensure that we give he the support he need to pursue it 
 enersys absl be a space battery manufacturer base at the culham campus in my oxfordshire constituency the minister will be aware that culham have be designate as an ai growth zone by the government it apply for an export licence last august but get an outcome only last week which mean the contract be nearly lose to a french competitor what step be the minister take to improve the process for grant export licence so that company be not subject to this kind of last minute jeopardy 
 i be unfamiliar with the particular case but concerned by that description we inherit the export licensing system and we be review it as part of our ongoing work look at all aspect of the government ’s work if the hon member write to i i will certainly take a personal interest in the matter and write back to he 
 folkestone and hythe have a long history as a thriving tourist destination but in recent year with brexit and rise cost thing be get hard for business in our coastal community what step be the department take to support the growth of the tourism and hospitality industry in kent 
 i know from personal experience that there be some great hospitality and tourism business in kent and we want to see they do even well in the come month and year that be why we be seek to   support the sector through initiative such as business rate reform and the licensing taskforce which have just start work it be also why the government will launch a national visitor economy strategy this autumn as we seek to welcome international visitor annually by and many of they i suspect will visit kent 
 if the secretary of state be not go to visit farnham can i tempt he to visit fountain beauty therapy in hurtmore a much love business in my constituency the owner clare porter talk about the extreme pressure cause by the employment rights bill the hike in employer national insurance and the withdrawal of business rate relief lead to a crisis in the hair and beauty sector what measure be the secretary of state planning to alleviate pressure on this very important sector 
 i be grateful to finally get an invitation to somewhere we understand that there be significant pressure for many business and the global situation certainly will not provide reassurance in the short term the measure in the employment rights bill be not in effect yet and will take some time to come in since the election nearly job have be create so the labour market be hold up particularly strongly there be particular issue such as make sure we get probationary period right and that hour contract be monitor in the right way and we be work with business on that 
 this month i meet berkshire growth hub which work with business in bracknell and beyond on everything from start up to opportunity in ai how can we ensure that growth hub work with skills england to continue to deliver local growth in community such as mine 
 i commend my hon friend for meet with berkshire growth hub growth hub play a crucial role in local economy we want to supplement their work with our business growth service which be set to launch later this year and we be work with skills england to identify the skill shortage in particular area i be happy to ensure that skills england talk to berkshire growth hub through my hon friend so that the particular skill challenge in berkshire be understand by skills england 
 arrangement at the border be disadvantage company on both side of the channel so there be mutual advantage to be have in negotiation without feel the need to make any major concession be n’t there 
 i be not entirely convinced that the previous government be a compass by which to navigate the next set of negotiation with the european union the right hon gentleman be entirely right that there be a whole series of unnecessary barrier to trade between ourselves and the european union that be put in place as a direct consequence of the failure of the negotiation lead by the previous government he be right to recognise that that be affect directly a whole number of business on both side of the channel as the secretary of state say there be politic on both side of the channel but we be work very hard for british business in that context 
 can the minister assure the steel community of south wales that they will receive a substantial share of the £ steel fund 
 my hon friend and several other welsh colleague have be talk to i about this we renegotiate the deal with port talbot and the £ that go alongside that i have a good meeting this week with blastr which be look to build an iron pellet plant at the port talbot site if possible and we be try to support that of course our focus in recent week have be on scunthorpe and british steel but the steel fund remain the steel plan be still be work on which be very broad and hop to lift the entire uk steel industry 
 sheen uncovered be a clothing business in my constituency that the secretary of state be welcome to visit any time it have be significantly affect by the need to pay import duty up front thank to the conservatives terrible brexit deal and that duty range between and and greatly impact its cash flow what be the government do to support business such as sheen uncover to reduce the challenge of import cost 
 i assure the hon lady that we be look at how we can improve that relationship and she be right to recognise that a whole number of barrier be create as a consequence of choice make previously which be cause significant challenge to business small medium and large as the secretary of state make clear we can not give a running commentary on discussion that be under way but i assure she that the need and concern of british business be uppermost in our mind in those discussion 
 on the day of the government ’s necessary action to save british steel i send the secretary of state a letter request a meeting to discuss what far we need to do for grangemouth where hundred of job have be lose this week when petroineos decide to cease refining operation and where thousand of further job be at risk will he commit to meet i to discuss the urgent action that we need to take to secure accelerated investment in grangemouth ’s industrial future 
 i can absolutely give that assurance i have have meeting about this issue just this week we be ambitious for the just transition for grangemouth and recognise the issue not just with the refinery but with the polyethylene cracker we will get to work and set that meeting up 
 many rural business rely on farm for their trade since the government announce the family farm tax in the budget cbi economics have speak to over business and farm across the country—49 say that they have either cancel or defer investment and say that they have reduce or pause it altogether how   can the government say that they be support local   business and what will the department do to support farm and rural business that be suffer because of the government ’s policy 
 i feel that be a question for either the treasury or the department for environment food and rural affairs but the hon lady make it well agriculture feature prominently in trade and business and i will ensure that she get the right opportunity to put question about taxation to the chancellor 
 across my constituency in recent week we have experience severe delay to post in those area serve by the huntingdon delivery office that follow a recent restructuring of the workforce and change to delivery route rural community and business in particular have be impact with miss hospital appointment and several business tell i that it be affect their ability to receive and therefore pay invoice will the minister urgently investigate those ongoing and worsen delay in huntingdon and write to i with the outcome of his finding 
 i have to wait minute for a question mr speaker but this be an important and i share the hon member ’s concern we regularly meet ofcom to discuss the performance of royal mail and i will certainly write to he about the discussion we have in respect of his constituency 
 what discussion have the minister have with his counterpart in northern ireland about encourage young people into casual hospitality employment to teach they about the benefit of work and the importance of manage money 
 i be always grateful to the hon gentleman for his question we always seek to keep colleague in northern ireland well brief on a range of issue particularly some of the complexity around trade that have come out of the windsor agreement and need to be manage carefully i do not think i have have a specific conversation about the matter he raise but this be a good opportunity to say that i think i should and i will i be grateful to he for get that on the record 
 will the secretary of state be straightforward with the house today about how much taxpayer money have be spend so far on british steel 
 the amount of work capital provide to british steel to date stand at £ which be considerably less than if we have give a large amount of money to jingye or if we have have to deal with the complete loss of the entire british steel site and business 
 modelling by the scottish government have show that brexit make barrier be likely to have reduce scottish export by £ compare with continue eu membership great co operation and a close relationship with the eu will always be encourage by snp members but do the secretary of state recognise that anything short of full single market and custom union membership continue to damage scotland ’s economy 
 in substantive term the hon gentleman ’s point be important we should be look to reduce unnecessary barrier to trade between the united kingdom and our friend neighbour and partner in the european union however on a political level it be worth recognise that have scotland vote in to leave the united kingdom it would also have leave the european union there be a certain irony in be tell that a politic of flag border and manufactured grievance be wrong in context when his party continue to argue for they in another 
 accord to report in the guardian government source have say that issue around visa have be resolve as part of the government ’s free trade agreement negotiation with india will the secretary of state rule out visa liberalisation as part of those negotiation 
 we should always be careful about what we read in some newspaper laughter the hon gentleman know that we can not give a running commentary on trade negotiation but the uk india talk have be fruitful this week i be optimistic and excited for the future of what be a key relationship bilaterally and for the signal it can send to the rest of the world 
 urgent question   to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if he will make a statement on the government ’s approach to reduce energy price for energy intensive industry 
 i relay my thought to the worker in my hon friend ’s constituency for whom i know this be a worrying time i thank my hon friend for raise the issue he be a tireless champion for worker and business in his constituency we have speak and will continue to speak regularly about these issue and the importance of the ceramics industry in his area in particular 
 this government recognise the challenge high energy price pose to uk business we know that the ceramics sector be particularly affect my hon friend have raise the issue in parliament on other occasion the government be work closely with ceramics uk and local stoke mps to work out how we can support the sector 
 for energy intensive industry overall our clean power target be the key to long term sustainable price reduction clean home grow energy be the good way to protect bill payer and boost britain ’s energy independence we be already bring energy cost for uk industry close into line with other major economy through the british industry supercharger that will fully exempt eligible firm include some but by no means all of those in the ceramics sector from certain cost link to renewable energy policy particularly those expose to the high cost of electricity 
 use more electricity and less fossil fuel be the future for uk business the late advice from the climate change committee expect electricity to meet of industrial energy demand by so we be develop option to enable business to do that 
 we be already take action when my hon friend raise this important issue in a westminster hall debate in march i note 
 we be work on how to remove undeveloped speculative programme from the grid connection queue and prioritise other ”—[official report   march vol c. 109wh 
 just last month we announce pro growth reform to help unlock £ of mainly private investment a year in clean energy and infrastructure so that so call zombie project will no long hold up the queue for connection to the electricity grid 
 we recognise that we need to support a range of energy intensive industry include industry such as ceramic that be essential to our uk economy and our mission for example to build the home and the clean energy infrastructure product in which this government be already invest follow year of economic chaos and instability under the previous administration this government be implement a modern industrial strategy that will drive growth and the creation of good high quality job in community across the uk 
 i look forward to continue to work with my hon friend and other hon member from across the house we be meet next wednesday and i hope to be able to progress thing far at that stage 
 i thank the minister for her engagement on this issue because she have genuinely and authentically try to look for a way forward when my hon friend the members for stoke on trent north david williams and for stoke on trent south dr gardner and i have a meeting with the minister week ago we warn she that other factory be go to fail and we stand here follow the closure of moorcroft yesterday she will be aware that other factory in stoke on trent be work on short time as a way of reduce cost so that they can put more money into meet their ever increase energy bill 
 i thank the minister for the outline she have give but she will know that we have previously talk about most of the thing she have raise today and they do not apply to the ceramics sector or to great swathe of the energy industrial sector as a whole the supercharger scheme do not work for the ceramics sector indeed ceramics company end up have to subsidise other energy intensive industry because they be not part of the supercharger scheme we have be tell that we can not see an exception to that we have ask about the emission trading scheme and free trade allowance and have be tell that some be available for ceramic but that do not go far enough to meet the demand we have today 
 we have be constantly promise jam tomorrow by the last government as well as this well jam be no good if you be dead and the ceramics sector in stoke on trent be on life support we be at a point where good manufacturing job do by proud people be fall away every month this be not new it start in with the closure of dudson and continue with the closure of wade in johnson tiles in and royal stafford and now moorcroft in the energy intensive industry in this country be pivotal to manufacturing if we see they fall away manufacture in this country will fall away 
 i ask the minister very simple question will she look at a wholesale change to the way in which we do subsidy and energy price for energy intensive industry in the short term before gb energy come online as well meaning as gb energy be it be too far away to help will she rule out specifically move any policy cost on to gas cost gas be the big cost for the ceramics sector electricity be a small proportion of what we do will she take the opportunity to make a clear commitment at the dispatch box as the secretary of state for business and trade just do when he talk about a sector fall on its knee ceramic be there we do not need the same level of investment that steel do we need a tiny fraction of it can we have it and can we have it soon if we have to come back here in week there will be no sector leave to defend 
 i agree with my hon friend and recognise the challenge we lose job in the ceramics sector between and it have be a very sad decline and we want to turn that around 
 the whole point of an industrial strategy be to have a government who be proactive in support our industry we will not put extra cost on the ceramics industry we be look to see how we can help and support my hon friend have my word on that we be work on every single of the suggest policy reform in the package that ceramics uk have put forward and we will meet he next week to talk about these thing 
 i can not make promise at the dispatch box on area that be not my responsibility and rule out whole swathe of policy but i assure my hon friend that we will not put extra cost on the ceramics industry we be look to do more and to support and we will come back i completely understand his point about the timing and the need to act quickly 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 grangemouth the luton vauxhall plant and now the moorcroft pottery in stoke on trent every single week we hear of more job loss in energy intensive industry and more british company shut up shop and lay off worker because of the toxic combination of high energy cost and this chancellor ’s devastating job tax we have the high industrial electricity price in the developed world just this week ineos tell we in no uncertain term that carbon taxis and high energy cost be kill off manufacturing in the uk 
 this government have be warn by opposition members by the gmb this week and by unite this week they be warn by none other than tony blair what be their response adviser in no downing street pick up the phone and beg he to row back on what he say they ask he to row back on what we all know to be true what the minister morgan mcsweeney apparently and an increase number of the government ’s own back benchers know to be true the current approach to energy and net be doom to fail and voter be be ask to make financial sacrifice when they know that the impact on global emission be minimal that be at the heart of this madness 
 this government be wilfully destroy british industry in oil and gas ceramic chemical and metal when they know that it will not make a difference to global emission we will not use any less oil and gas neither will we use any less steel cement brick or chemical we will just import those thing from abroad at great cost to our economy and the climate and with british job loss add to the bargain as the government be lead by an ideological zealot the secretary of state for energy security and net and by a prime minister too weak to rein he in we will continue down this path and british worker will pay the price in aberdeen in grangemouth in luton and today in stoke 
 energy be not a silo energy cost underpin growth prosperity competitiveness and living standard without cheap energy our industry will not survive british manufacturer can not remain competitive so what will the minister do to prevent more british job be lose in energy intensive industry in this country will she listen to the head of unite who say that working class people be lose their job and that this government have no plan to replace they will the government end their mad ideological plan to shut down north sea operation what will it take for labour back benchers to wake up and realise that this ideological approach be cripple this country 
 the conservative party be hide behind this new find scepticism of net to conceal its complete failure to support and grow our foundational   and manufacture industry on its watch on its watch we lose job in the north sea and job in the ceramics sector chemical manufacturing fall by and we produce only of the steel that we use in this country the conservative party ’s record on this issue be shameful 
 this government have a completely different approach we be develop the industrial strategy which will support those foundational industry we be look to make sure we can reach net by in order to provide the economic and energy security we need the last cost of living crisis be cause by our reliance on global gas price as   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   know and as he occasionally say in some meeting when he flip and flop on his position on net we will support manufacturing we be develop our industrial strategy which will be publish in a few week time and we be already provide more support to the energy intensive industry through the energy supercharger than the previous government do we will act where the previous government fail to act 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell   be an enormous champion of the ceramics industry and he be right to bring this question to the house today but this issue be wide than simply the ceramics sector tata steel have tell our committee that energy price be the single big factor in its lack of competitiveness and nissan have tell we that electricity price at its plant in sunderland be the high of any nissan plant in the world we have recommend that the government bring energy price in line with our european competitor can the minister tell we today that she share that ambition 
 i thank my right hon friend the committee chair for his question of course this be a huge issue under the previous government industrial energy price double and as my right hon friend say we have high price than many other country the people who respond to our consultation on the industrial strategy say that energy skill and access to finance be their top issue so we be absolutely aware of the issue we be look at what support we can provide and how we can make our country more competitive both for the people who be look to invest in the uk and for our exist manufacturing base 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats believe that the future of british industry and our national security depend on a serious and sustained commitment to renewable energy we want to see far great emphasis on clean energy source particularly solar in order to reduce our dangerous reliance on fossil fuel strengthen our energy security and tackle fuel poverty by bring down energy bill for household and business alike in the face of putin ’s barbaric war in europe and with donald trump ’s reckless tariff threaten fresh economic turmoil we can not afford to be complacent the future of energy intensive industry not least our steel industry hang in the balance 
 steelmaking be not just an economic asset it be of vital strategic importance to the uk we need steel in order to build the infrastructure require for a sustainable secure future from wind turbine and railway to hospital and home without it our ambition for net and national resilience will collapse as such will the government give a clear unequivocal commitment to their net plan and will they ensure that no option be off the table when it come to safeguard our steel industry and the future of british manufacturing 
 i can give the hon gentleman reassurance that we be look at all option to support the steel industry which be foundational to our country he make the correct point about how important steel be to build our future whether it be runway home or other infra- structure we be look at all option and we have the steel plan which will be come out soon and the £ earmark to support the steel industry 
 my constituency have many brilliant metal manufacturing company that supply critical uk industry in defence automotive and construction however many of they be struggle because the last government leave we with sky high electricity price and a dependence on foreign gas import last month i launch make uk ’s new electrify industry initiative in parliament which seek to address this broad challenge can the minister set out how the clean power action plan will make industrial energy cost cheap and help we drive growth in the west midland manufacturing industry 
 i thank my hon friend for her championing of her constituency i be still to visit and i must do that because i know she have many exciting place for i to see electrifying industry be crucial the climate change committee have say that that be the route and that of industry will need to be electrify we need to make sure we do that we be look through the spending review process as i be sure she would expect at how we can support industry to make that change to electric and how we can help with some of the capital cost which will lead to low cost in the long term make that leap can be difficult and that be what we be look at through the spending review 
 why be it well accord to the government to import gas from norway instead of develop our own north sea gas field 
 the north sea field be a decline basin we lose job under the previous government something like only in of the licence that have be approve over recent year have actually amount to anything because of the difficulty of a decline basin the impact on price of a very small amount of the global mix come from the north sea would be it would not change a penny in the cost we would pay 
 when the previous government look at support energy intensive industry they include within the definition brewer cider maker and wine maker but not distiller despite the fact that distiller use kw per hour to make a litre of alcohol compare with   brewer which use just kw per hour as the government consider what they will have to do to support energy intensive industry such as distilling will the minister consider that the scotch whisky industry in particular be critical to the maintenance of economic activity and good- quality job in some of the most remote and economically fragile community in this country 
 we be obviously keen to do what we can to support the scottish whisky industry i have be to see it and understand how important it be the definition of energy intensive industry be develop under the previous government and we have no immediate plan to change those but i will take away the right hon gentleman ’s point and look into it 
 on net i think there be a national consensus on make the environment well create green job and improve energy security but will the minister recognise that for many people consumer and company out there particularly small business by the way it be not all about large one there be too much happen too soon and too fast rather than have regressive and punitive taxis on industry and small business there should be more education and more incentive to change consumer and company behaviour 
 the right hon gentleman make a perfectly reasonable point we have a national consensus that we need to act and i think the population be with we on that they understand that we need to make sure we have a planet for our child and our grandchild and that we need to do everything we can as be say this week we want to tread lightly on people ’s life and of course we do not want to inflict regressive and punitive taxation we want to make sure we be support industry and business and we be look at how we can help to incentivise the change that we need to see 
 despite scotland ’s grow abundance of potentially cheap renewable energy business in scotland ’s energy sector be deal a double blow whereby energy intensive business in the renewable supply chain be hammer by high energy cost in production and extortionate transmission charge when the minister look at this problem as her colleague tell i he would the other day will she bear in mind that this be entirely link to the high cost of produce energy and all the other way in which the current energy market model serve scotland poorly 
 i think it be probably the minister for energy my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks who give that assurance to the hon gentleman and he be look at all these issue we have a very complex energy system we be try to make it as cost effective as we can and sustainable in the long term to give we the energy security that we all need i be sure my hon friend will continue to look at these issue 
 a vital ingredient of any net policy be an understanding of the word net ultimately we be go to have to grapple with technology that we have have for over a century to remove carbon directly from the air be n’t we 
 we be happy to look at a range of option the whole point of the clean energy plan be that we be use a very diverse range of intervention some of which be more high tech and for the future and some of which be well establish we need that mix 
 give the huge economic and environmental effect of burn fossil fuel it be clear that the future of energy have to be clean green cheap renewable plus energy efficiency all of we who care about fact base truth base politic should call out the outrageous misinformation from those who suggest that net be the reason for high energy price when it clearly be not gas price have go through the roof in recent year and we all know why because of putin ’s outrageous invasion of ukraine that be why company and business be struggle 
 there be specific thing that the government can and should do to help precisely those business decouple the price of electricity from gas so that the true cost of generate electricity be reflect in the price that consumer pay and secondly implement a carbon tax in order to be able to use those revenue to assist industry to make the just transition from fossil fuel to the clean green cheap energy of the future 
 the hon lady be right to point out that there be a lot of misinformation in this space and it be often use by the conservatives to hide their own failing in government of course the energy price hike that we have be partly because the previous government have not deliver the security that we need in our home grow energy supply and storage we be look at all option to make sure that we have the right system in place go forward we already have the emission trading scheme and we be look at where that go in future year she be right to point out that we need to look at all these thing 
 the pretence be that britain be somehow catch in a storm- toss sea of international gas price which drive up energy cost but when ineos report that it be pay £ a year in carbon taxis rise to £ by be it not the case that we be see the cascade of job loss because labour have make decarbonisation deindustrialisation 
 i think the hon gentleman know that his own party be the expert on deindustrialisation which we see significantly across all part of our manufacturing sector include at ineos i regularly meet ineo as do the secretary of state and other colleague and we be look at what we can do to support the sector it face a lot of challenge and we be look to try to resolve they 
 my constituent in edinburgh west like many other across scotland and the uk depend on energy intensive industry for their livelihood defence whisky and grangemouth how can the minister reassure people who be already suffer because of high domestic energy price that the situation will not be make bad by lose job in those industry 
 the hon lady be right to raise these challenge which we be try to grapple with we be look at how we can provide support on energy price and other aspect for energy intensive industry of course the energy intensive industry that qualify for the supercharger be get significantly increase support from april which will be helpful but we recognise that that do not go far enough and we need to do more 
 talk of expert in deindustrialisation over job at luton ’s stellantis plant have be lose impact my constituent because this government do not respond to concern about energy policy if the minister do not agree with we on net do she agree with the general secretary of the gmb who say that the government ’s energy policy amount to 
 export job and import virtue 
 i have meet and talk with those from stellantis many time and while the closure of the site at luton be of course very difficult i know that the reason be global and complex it be simply not the case that it be because of energy policy stellantis face a whole range of issue globally and it have to respond in the way it do we regret that and we offer support but we could not get to a point where we could persuade it to stay we be work with the mps and the local council to ensure that what come afterwards provide good decent job but the hon member be just wrong to say that that be the only reason 
 the minister have tell the house that the government would not impose any new cost on the ceramics industry but we know that they be go to increase carbon taxis which will kill off energy intensive industry do she not see that this be a totally incoherent policy position 
 there be no coherence under the previous government and there will be coherence under this government we be develop our plan of support for our foundational industry in the industrial strategy i know that the opposition be very keen to see what the industrial strategy will contain they will have to wait a few week for its publication but all will be reveal in due course 
 i thank the minister very much for her answer manufacturing currently represent less than of the uk economy but in northern ireland it represent of the economy and about in family in northern ireland be dependent on manufacturing it be clear that as energy price rise so do the concern for such industry how can the government and the minister offer support to those industry to retain their viability while the government be find an energy solution 
 the hon member be right to raise this issue and the figure for manufacturing in northern ireland of or be high yesterday i be with trade unionist from shorts brothers spirit aerosystems to talk about the importance of manufacturing there and the importance of retain those job they make the point that these good job have help not just with   people ’s life but with the sectarian divide bring people out of poverty and give they good well pay job be an incredibly important part of the history of northern ireland and of what we need to preserve there i will continue to work with he to make sure we protect that manufacturing base we of course have huge support in the budget with the £ for the automotive sector and the £ for the aerospace sector to support exactly that manufacturing industry

 i be delighted that the leader of the house have give time for a general debate on ve day it be vital that we remember the sacrifice that each and every of our community make through the loss of servicemen for the liberty win for each and every of we we will never forget they 
 if i may i want to pay tribute to the parliamentary security and police team on monday evening a friend and i while on the terrace see a man enter the water outside from westminster bridge we run to report it to a police officer who take we very seriously and immediately report it in minute later emergency service locate the person and evacuate they i thank the emergency service and that police officer whose name i do not get for act in a timely way we wish the affected person well as he be take to hospital 
 i be grateful to the leader of the house for outline the forthcoming business she will i know be look forward to the fa cup final on   may   and will be cheer manchester city on to victory against crystal palace almost as loudly as she heckle opposition politician here i look forward to my team southampton meet her team later on that month although from our record i be not sure it will go too well 
 on the subject of own goal i be sure member on both side of the house will be look on with some confusion at the chaos in the government ’s rank follow the former prime minister tony blair ’s suggestion that the government ’s plan to phase out fossil fuel in the short term be doom to fail that election win machine at whose name many on the labour benches now groan at the simple mention of have speak sense of course it can be frustrating when former leader weigh in on debate with contrary view to the party they once lead believe i i know how the leader of the house and the secretary of state for energy security and net feel we have have more than our fair share but the government know that the former prime minister have a point 
 we know that the government be dread the local election today the real test of their performance in the month since they take power what will we see an ideological kamikaze dive towards net carbon emission that tonight will deliver gain of net seat i pay tribute to candidate of all party who have take the step to put their head above the parapet and who be willing to charge into the political fray without they our democracy would wither of course i would like to wish those stand as conservative candidate all the good and i hope the house will understand why i have do that 
 as voter go to the poll they will be ask themselves what sort of council they want to represent they and provide vital public service for they and their family do they want the high tax highly bureaucratic debt laden local authority of labour or do they want efficient effective and accountable local guardian which they have under the conservative let we not forget that conservative council deliver well service with low council taxis we do not have to look any far than labour control birmingham where bin bag have pile up on the street to get an idea of the monumental failure of this labour government so far that be to say nothing of the rat which not only represent a terrible health and safety threat to resident but terrorise the neighbourhood they infest they will not be jump from any sink ship but the government ’s past voter certainly be 
 why be the government ’s ship sink we need only look over at the labour benches to see who be to blame after month of labour government the promise of change have end up in the over fill bin of the council they control i will not argue that there have be some change the prime minister have change his donor fund armani suit many time while the pensioner that they have make poorer buy their clothe from the charity shop that this government be tax to the hilt talk of donor a labour donor be now become the independent football regulator what a bargain for half a pound most important be not the change the government have make but the fact that the public have change their mind about labour and how can we blame they 
 the office for budget responsibility have halve its estimate for growth this year with the government ’s continue campaign against the elderly farmer the self employ and small business owner it be no wonder that the government be so unpopular they have run out of people to target there be a saying that action   have consequence can the leader of the house find time to schedule a debate to discuss the consequence of her government ’s economic failure and the woeful action of their chancellor growth be at all time low taxis and debt be at an all time high business and charity be alarmed at how they will keep go can we have a debate on that mission for growth and how it be go i suspect the answer will be no 
 i want to raise final topic with the leader of the house which i and other colleague have touch on previously the long timeframe and poor quality response to write correspondence and write question from member as i be sure all member and the leader of the house will agree it be vital that we as parliamentarian be able to make representation to the government and receive response to our query in a timely manner with a reply that take full account of the question make too many time now member have have to raise in this chamber the response time or lack of response to their constituency inquiry the number of write question be answer by this government be down and i have to say that the quality of response be deteriorate i do hope she will take this up with her cabinet colleague 
 as we go away for our bank holiday i wish the leader of the house and all member a restful weekend with a chance to spend time with love one and perhaps put a call in to their chief whip we will return on tuesday when we will continue to hold this government to account for the people of this great country 
 i join the shadow minister in thank the police and security service of the house for the work they do day in day out and particularly in the case he have raise i take this opportunity to thank the king for all the work he be do for those live with cancer his openness about his own condition really do bring huge comfort to those live with theirs i also take this opportunity to welcome progress on the mineral agreement between the us and ukraine that be achieve overnight and the wide partnership the support of the government and of the whole house remain unwaveringly with those in ukraine and that will continue 
 i join the shadow minister in thank all candidate stand in the local election today and i thank he for wish man city all the success i hope it will get in the forthcoming fa cup final and against southampton 
 it be really good to see the shadow minister in his elevated place today reach the heady height of business question this morning i be sure he will agree that this be the pinnacle of his career so far as you can see mr speaker he have really draw in the crowd i be only joke the attendance be no reflection on he his journey to this point have be how shall i put it?—one of dogged and determined pursuit he be a councillor i believe when he be very young at just and have be a special adviser before come here he stand in a number of seat in fact in his relatively short parliamentary career he have already be the mp for different constituency 
 in all seriousness i have a great deal of time for the hon gentleman who be a formidable and notable representative of his party it might be a bit of a low bar right now but he be well above it he really be a rise star of the party 
 waning 
 he be a very popular member of this house hon member hear hear there we be 
 the shadow minister raise a matter that be very important to i timely and full response to write parliamentary question and correspondence i take this matter incredibly seriously and will continue as always to raise it with cabinet ministers collectively and individually when they fall short 
 the shadow minister also raise the issue of net i be sorry give his glitter career that he feel the need to read out from the late whip crib sheet on net the blinker vision that the conservatives have show on the opportunity of net and the transition that we need to make be why they do so little in their time in office 
 let we look at what be actually happen the north sea basin be diminish it be a finite resource that be why the workforce in the north sea have fall by a over the past year there be a global race for the new technology of the future and we be now in that race something the conservatives fail to do for many year we be make sure that the north sea have the opportunity of the future and there be some great opportunity that be why we be set up great british energy in aberdeen and why we have announce £ for carbon capture which will be critical to the future of the north sea basin it be also why we be look to reindustrialise the future with thing like hydrogen nuclear and other energy 
 the shadow minister mention the former leader of the labour party but he might want to look at what some of his own party ’s former leader have say in recent year i think theresa may speak very wisely last autumn just as the conservatives be perform a complete volte face over net when she say 
 when the sceptic say that the green transition will cripple business we say they could not be more wrong when the critic say transition to renewable cost too much we say it ’ wrong to see it as a cost it ’ an enormous investment opportunity 
 she be right be n’t she he know she be 
 if the hon gentleman want to talk about the local election i be sure that we can have an exchange of statistic but the that i will leave he with be that council tax bill for people live in labour council be on average £ low than elsewhere that be the thing that people should be think about today of all day 
 i do not want to be too harsh on the hon gentleman because i be fond of he have say that we be now month on from the leader of the opposition take up her position today will be her major electoral test and i wonder how the conservatives think thing be really go because they have be veer from side of the road to the other they have be take just about every position possible even on monday they vote against their own football governance bill they actually write it and their poor mortified shadow secretary of state who have previously call it an excellent bill have to put up the good act that i have see in a long time of speak against it from the dispatch box 
 the leadership of the leader of the opposition be be backseat drive by the shadow justice secretary who be on constant manoeuvre he be no doubt spend the day on the phone not to the elector but to his   future backer he have promise this electoral pact with reform but the truth be that the party be indistinguishable at the moment i can not tell the difference between the once great conservative party and the reform party because we all know that vote tory today mean vote reform and that vote reform today mean vote tory
