humanitarian aid should never be use as a political tool and isreal must restart the aid immediately a lot of diplomatic activity be go on at this time as i say steve witkoff the us special envoy to the middle east have fly into the area and we be in touch with the us i be work closely with the e3 and the eu in fact i will be speak very shortly to my french counterpart we have not give up hope i sense that there have be a loss of hope that we can get back to the ceasefire from hon member in the chamber but i tell they now this foreign secretary have not give up hope that we can get back to the ceasefire it be my job to try and do the good to deliver that and that be what i intend to do in the come hour 
 the double standard and injustice we be witness on the international stage be truly appalling it be obvious that isreal be break international law as every serious legal expert on international law have point out it be shameful frankly that the government refuse to state   that about isreal but will rightly do so about russia ’s violation in ukraine i say to the foreign secretary that the concern and outrage that he express at the dispatch box be not end the bloodshed when will we get the scale of sanction on isreal that its war crime demand 
 i think we all share the foreign secretary ’s shock anger and frustration at the breakdown of the ceasefire and the death that we be see in gaza as today ’s debate show word matter i want to follow up on the comment make by my hon friend   the member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward give that we be now hear report of ground activity in gaza lead by israeli force israel katz the defence minister claim that the evacuation of gaza would resume and he be threaten total devastation those be not the action of a government who want peace they be the action of an increasingly authoritarian government who be more interested in their own political survival than in the survival of any innocent civilian be they palestinian or israeli this be not what the hostage family want to see and we should speak for they as much as for the innocent civilian in gaza and the palestinians whose life be be lose for the avoidance of doubt will the foreign secretary be clear that we do not agree with but   condemn the word of isreal katz as they be not go to bring forward the ceasefire or uphold international law if they be leave unchallenged 
 the language that we use in this conflict matter we know what have happen and the foreign secretary have remind we today for week supply of basic good and electricity have be block to say that isreal risk breach international law for have do that be to say that this country do not see those act as a prima facie breach of international law that be how it will be hear in tel aviv be that really the government ’s position 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help tackle fly tipping 
 what step he be take to tackle fly tipping 
 what step he be take to tackle fly tipping 
 what step he be take to tackle fly tipping 
 what step he be take to tackle fly tipping 
 happy spring equinox and happy world sparrow day to you mr speaker and to everyone in the house 
 fly tipping blight community harm the environment and place huge cost on taxpayer and business council deal with over incident in some more than in the previous year this government will crack down on fly tipping by establish clean up squad comprise of those very individual who dump rubbish in our community we be also tackle litter by introduce a ban on single use vape from   june   this year and a deposit return scheme for drink container 
 rochdale council have remove fly- tip this past year alone the equivalent of tonne of illegally dump waste every month at a cost of £ to local taxpayer but my council tell i that there be a real failure in the court issue consistent and tough enough fine do the minister agree with i that it be time to crack down hard on fly tipper put much tight regulation on waste carrier and treat the fly tipper like the criminal they be by crush their car and put point on their licence 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend—[interruption i hear enthusiasm for his comment from both side of the house rochdale council have an exemplary record on fly tipping with fix penalty notice and prosecution which be admirable last week the environment agency work with the north west regional organised crime unit to arrest man in manchester for fraud and money laundering follow an extensive investigation into packaging export note use by law abide firm to export waste that be unlawfully sell for £ our message to the waste criminal be clear we be seek power in the crime and policing bill and we be go to track they down 
 fly tipping be a scourge on local community and a drain on council resource be they rural council like central bedfordshire or town council like luton in my constituency most recent figure show that there be over fly tipping incident in luton alone in but do the minister agree that we need a co ordinated approach between the department local authority and the police to deliver a holistic strategy to tackle fly tipping 
 it be clear that my hon friend be right luton have a particular problem with fly tipping but the council have be do good work with fix penalty notice and prosecution the department for environment food and rural affairs chair the national fly tipping prevention group and we work with a wide range of interested party include council the environment agency the national farmers union and the national police chiefs council to disseminate good practice and i urge luton to join we in that endeavour 
 although city of wolverhampton council be to be congratulate on introduce a range of initiative to tackle fly tipping include deploy drone raise the fine for fly tipping to £ and reward those who identify culprit with gift card fly tipping in my constituency of wolverhampton west cost wolverhampton taxpayer around £ a year and involve some incident during do the minister agree that we need strong disincentive to discourage those who fly tip so that that £ can be redistribute to where it be really need 
 i be interested to hear about the work my hon friend ’s council be do with drone we use cctv but there could be lesson for other council in our manifesto we commit to force fly tipper to clean up their mess we be seek power to issue statutory fly tip enforcement guidance so we have a consistent and effective approach but it be clear that the waste carrier broker and dealer and the exemption permit regime be not fit for purpose i have ask my official to look at everything we can do to strengthen both of those 
 fly tipping be a blight on our community but in stoke on trent our labour lead council have work tirelessly to turn thing around under the conservatives resident be wait for over a month for waste to be remove but under the leadership of jane ashworth and amjid wazir that response time be now under week however council can not tackle the issue alone so will the minister outline   what more the government can do to support local council to clamp down on fly tipping get tough on those who blight our street and create clean green community for all 
 it be interesting what a difference a change in council leadership make i commend councillor ashworth and councillor wazir on their excellent work this government will introduce mandatory digital waste tracking from april and i will update the house on progress in may if people want their street to be clean up the answer be clear vote labour 
 fly tipping be a real concern in my constituency of woking but i understand that the previous government introduce new power that enable woking borough council and other local authority to strengthen their action against people who fly tip what impact have those measure have 
 we have not assess the impact but i can tell the hon gentleman the late statistic for his own council there be more than fly tipping incident but just fix penalty notice and no prosecution local councillor be clearly make choice we know that the late statistic for fly tipping show a rise of so it be clear that under the previous government this environmental crime be allow to spiral out of control i encourage all council of whatever colour to make good use of their enforcement power 
 alas the last government do not take up my suggestion that the offender be garrotte with their own intestine the problem however be to catch they be there any way that local authority can be encourage to take advantage of the collapse in price and improvement in quality of internet connect camera 
 i think there would be some human right implication with the garrotting option but i share the right hon gentleman ’s passionate hatred for these environmental criminal he be a representative of the beautiful new forest where i have spend many happy holiday and it really upset i to see fly tipping on ancient woodland run by the forestry commission these be precious and irreplaceable area we have not look at that part of his suggestion but i be very happy to join force with he and make it a cross party mission that we sort the mess out once and for all 
 conservative run east sussex county council have introduce a booking system for the local tip in eastbourne that will make it even more difficult for many people to get rid of their waste many local campaigner be concerned that it will result in increase fly tipping specifically in area such as upperton in my constituency and we have already see it in hartfield square and upperton gardens how might the minister be able to influence east sussex county council to u turn on its unpopular decision and to keep our community clean and free from fly tipping 
 all council have be give an uplift under this labour government so they have more money to be able to deal with the priority of their   local community and i encourage they to think about where that money be spend there be also a really important equality issue here if people do not have access to the internet in east sussex due to blackspot they might not be able to digitally book in so i would look at digital exclusion the people who be least able to afford the internet should not be force into deal with unscrupulous rogue 
 we know that fly tipping be an expensive and dangerous nuisance local authority such as conservative lead walsall council be take a really proactive and determined approach to tackle it but with bin strike on our doorstep under the neighbour labour lead birmingham city council we fear more fly tipping particularly in the community that border birmingham alarmingly we be hear of rat the size of cat in britain ’s city and these squeaky blinder be definitely not welcome in aldridge brownhills what specific support can the minister provide to neighbouring authority in these specific circumstance and what can she do to bring the bin strike to an end 
 obviously birmingham city council ’s bin situation be a matter for the council but as a neighbouring mp in coventry we have not see any of the fly tipping that the right hon lady talk about see in walsall both side need to get round the table and sort this out for the benefit of the people of birmingham 
 what recent discussion he have have with ofwat on encourage water company to increase investment in sewage discharge reduction measure 
 my official and i have regular conversation with ofwat and other regulator as the right hon gentleman will be aware last year water company discharge record level of sewage into our waterway which be why the water special measures act give the regulator tough new power include the ability to ban the payment of unfair bonus to pollute water boss the government have also secure a record £ that will include improvement to more than storm overflow and significantly reduce sewage spill over the next year 
 i wish you a happy world sparrow day madam deputy speaker 
 in bramley in my constituency in sewage be spill into the local river for hour in godalming the figure be hour in chiddingfold it be hour and in cranleigh it be hour that be the equivalent of nearly hour every single day it be totally unacceptable as a result last year after pressure from i and other thames water agree to invest £ by the end of next year will the secretary of state meet i and the chief executive of thames water to see whether that money be actually be spend 
 the situation that the right hon gentleman describe be absolutely outrageous and member across the house will recognise similar situation in their own   area we need to completely reset the water sector so that these situation can not continue which be why sir jon cunliffe be lead a water commission i hope that the right hon gentleman and other member be take the opportunity to feed their experience and those of their constituent into his call for evidence and i would be happy to arrange for the right hon gentleman to meet an appropriate minister to discuss his concern 
 i get so many people in north west leicestershire tell i about the toxic sewage pour into their waterway such as in the brook near donington le heath will the secretary of state assure i that unlike the previous government when he say that he will hold the water boss to account he mean it 
 absolutely that be why we have pass and my hon friend will have vote for the water special measures act which give the regulator the power they need to hold those water boss to account so that instead of pay themselves multimillion pound bonus they do not deserve that money be spend where it should be spend on fix our break sewage system so that we can cut the sewage flow that be pollute our river up and down the country 
 what estimate he have make of the number of farmer affect by change to agricultural and business property relief 
 around claim each year will be impact our reform will mean that farmer will pay a reduce inheritance tax rate of rather than the standard and payment can be spread over year interest free farm own couple can pass on up to £ without pay inheritance tax in our view this be a fair and balanced approach and should be see against the backdrop of the government commit £ for farming over year the large budget direct at sustainable food production and nature ’s recovery in our country ’s history 
 i be start to feel like defra ministers be purposefully ignore i and devon ’s farming community i have give the secretary of state since early december to answer my letter and my invitation to meet with devon ’s farming community in order to explain how change to agricultural property relief and business property relief be go to affect they at the last defra question i call out the secretary of state for not reply to any of my request the minister for food farming and fishery reply from the dispatch box that 
 i would love to meet farmer in devon so i be happy to add he to the list for my grand tour across the country to reassure people that there be a strong plan to ensure that farmer have a viable future”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 so far those platitude have go unrealised with less than a month until these change take effect devon ’s farmer be still in the dark about how the change be go to affect they if this be how minister treat   fellow mp be it any wonder that farmer up and down the country feel completely abandon by this labour government 
 i hear the hon gentleman ’s complaint but i have be to devon in my role before and i will come to devon again i be always happy to meet farmer i have spend quite a lot of time at this dispatch box answer question from conservative members so perhaps few question will mean more time to go out and meet farmer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 back in november the farming minister unbelievably say from the government dispatch box that it be strike how many people be come up to he at farming event and say you ’re right to be make these change to apr and bpr conservative members have be out and about all over the country indeed i be in staffordshire warwickshire and shropshire yesterday and i have not find farmer who think that he be right in fact the level of anger and sheer disbelief among our farming community be immense as this government ’s attack on our farming cash flow continue through the dramatic reduction in delinked payment the sudden stop of the sustainable farming incentive and the rise in employer ’s national insurance contribution i could go on business confidence be at an all time low so can the minister provide the name of just farmer he have speak to who think he and his government be right to be pursue these change 
 i suggest that the shadow minister go out and speak to a few more people because i be stop in a local village just this weekend and encourage interruption i be not go to name name but he should check with some of his conservative candidate in election they say keep on go you be do the right thing the situation be not as the shadow minister describe he might do well to look at the figure for project farm business income for this year which show that in many sector those business income be do rather well that probably explain why people be not as exercise about it as he 
 i call the liberal democrats spokesperson 
 be the minister aware that some of the farmer who will be worst hit by the apr change be those who farm in severely disadvantaged area in the upland around our country where typically property value be high and income be extremely low when the change be make just last week with people be exclude from the sustainable farming incentive people have enter the sfi in this session and only of they be hill farmer be he also aware that his own department ’s figure show that at the end of the transition the average hill farm income will be of the national minimum wage do he not understand that his change be bring harm to the poor farmer in the prettiest place such as mine will he undertake to look at the liberal democrat proposal to bring in an uplands reward so that we do not plunge into poverty those people who care for our precious landscape 
 the hon gentleman always speak with passion about his constituent and i absolutely understand those concern he be right to say that the scheme we inherit do not reward those area as well as they should that be why in our announcement a few week ago we increase the high level stewardship payment by £ which will be of particular advantage to people in his area i agree with he and the scheme we inherit be not good enough that be why we be revise they 
 what step his department be take to improve flood defence in hartlepool 
 after year the conservatives leave our flood defence asset in the bad condition on record that be why this government be invest a record £ over year to improve flood resilience we will build maintain and repair flood defence to well protect property by march 
 the flood defence in and around greatham creek in my constituency of hartlepool date back to the century and be come to the end of their usable life i be campaign to secure the funding we need to realise the environment agency ’s ambitious multimillion pound plan to upgrade these defence and create a new habitat that extend biodiversity in that area will the minister commit to deliver that funding for hartlepool 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue and for his recent letter he be right to be angry about the poor state of his flood defence and i be sure his constituent value he as a local champion raise that in the chamber to rebuild after conservative failure we have have to urgently move £ into maintenance funding this year as i have mention the project to receive funding in the next financial year be be agree and will be announce shortly 
 under the previous government there be prior to a strategy from westminster to address flooding and coastal erosion across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland all the region be able to benefit from that include my constituency of strangford where coastal erosion be a massive thing take away some of the major road and thoroughfare will the minister consider renew that strategy and start it again look at all of the united kingdom as job lot that would thereby help we all to get the benefit in address coastal erosion and the flooding that   the hon member for hartlepool mr brash   refer to 
 i thank the hon member for raise his concern about coastal erosion and he be right it be a huge problem and with climate change it be only set to get bad i completely recognise how it be impact coastal community his suggestion to bring together the different devolve government to discuss this issue be really interesting so let i take that away 
 rise 
 the question have to relate to hartlepool ’s flood defence i call the chair of the environmental audit committee 
 the people of chesterfield have great empathy with the people of hartlepool as we face exactly the same issue a new report by public show that each year of flood event cause decade long downward pressure on the economy worth up to £ i be grateful that the minister will shortly visit we in chesterfield to see flood project and vulnerability but do she agree that there be acute need for project like the we require on the river hipper and the require in hartlepool it endanger the government ’s growth mission if we be not able to get these project go 
 i think we all have empathy with hartlepool so i encourage more people to ask question on this issue i look forward to visit my hon friend ’s constituency to find out more about the project he mention he be quite right to say this be an argument that i hope we will all pursue ahead of the spring statement that tackle flooding be a good value for money investment because it help to protect our economy and ensure that we can have growth 
 i call wera hobhouse who i know be now anxious 
 like people in hartlepool we in bath recognise that the conservative government leave our flood defence in a poor state and we welcome the extra funding that the bath flood defence scheme have receive however we worry that it have come too late in a lot of case be there a timeline for when my bath constituent will actually see improvement 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this issue as i say we be deliver a record £ billon investment in building maintain and upgrade flood defence and that money will be spend over the next year we will shortly announce some of the project that be go ahead in the next financial year and next year we will announce even more there will be an announcement this year for the next financial year and an announcement next year for the half of the year record investment that show out commitment to building maintain and improve flood defence up and down our country 
 what step he be take to protect flood prone community in cumbria 
 as i may have already mention we be put in a record £ investment to build maintain and improve flood defence up and down the country which show this government ’s commitment to make sure that our community and our farmland be protect from flooding 
 i thank the minister for her answer community in cumbria have see many devastating flood over the last decade but flood action group in keswick have work hard with united utilities to develop a scheme that use thirlmere reservoir as a storm water store help to prevent flooding in the town all agree that more could be do although i applaud their work i note that there be no statutory requirement for water company to use their asset as flood defence will the minister look at how water company asset can be use to prevent flooding across the country 
 i be grateful not only for the work that my hon friend ’s action flood group do but for the work that flood action group do right across the whole of his constituency he raise an incredibly important and interesting issue in the sir john cunliffe review we be fundamentally look at the management of water right across entire catchment area when we think about water management we need to consider not only whether community have enough water to meet their need but whether they have protection from flooding and drought a holistic way of deal with some of the challenge we face be certainly of the answer go forward my hon friend have give a great example and i would be happy to explore it far with he 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the conservative government protect over property from flooding introduce the £ frequently flood allowance and commit to a £ investment in flood protection however we know that the mental health impact of flooding remain long after the water subside rural community face unique challenge include outbreak of disease such as avian influenza and foot and mouth a clear and worrying threat give the recent case in germany and hungary unfortunately this labour government be exacerbate such stress with their family farm tax and by scrap the farming resilience fund which support mental health can the minister confirm for the sake of mental health what support will be offer to rural community in place of the scrap fund 
 that all start so well we nearly manage to get through the question with i agree with the hon gentleman he be quite right about this issue which he have mention before i be in complete agreement with he about the impact of flooding on mental health and i know that we all take it seriously we be invest £ in mental health charity to support rural community but i completely recognise the devastation that flood cause and i be always happy to work with member from across the house on how we can support people ’s mental health 
 if he will take step to implement the provision of the environment act on deforestation due diligence 
 the big driver of deforestation worldwide be agricultural expansion   particularly the production of a small number of commodity such as soy and palm oil this government be consider the approach to the deforestation regulation and nothing have yet be rule in or out 
 i thank the minister for her answer tomorrow be the international day of forest the environment act be pass over year ago with strong public and cross party support yet the due diligence provision to prevent the import of commodity link to illegal deforestation remain unimplemented cause uncertainty for uk business will the minister provide a clear timeline for when the secondary legislation will come into force and will she meet i as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on global deforestation alongside other member to discuss how we can strengthen and accelerate its implementation 
 the uk strongly support global effort to protect forest and we be advocate for the international commitment to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by while at the same time support forest dweller and economic development as i say nothing have yet be rule in or out and i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this far 
 what step he be take to encourage public body to prioritise the purchase of british produce 
 the new national procurement policy statement set out requirement for government contract and favour high quality product that we believe british producer be very well place to supply this will support our ambition to ensure that half of the food supply for public sector catering come from local producer or those certify to high environmental standard 
 i welcome the minister ’s commitment to ensure that of public procurement be of british produce give the significant £ of bargaining power that this represent what step be he take to ensure that this lead to fair price for farmer and support the fundamental operating profitability of the sector 
 i be grateful for the question from my hon friend we be absolutely determined to make the good of this opportunity not least because the previous government do not know how much we be actually buy the secretary of state have announce that we will monitor the food buy in the public sector and that will inform our policy of make sure that british farmer make the most of the opportunity for public procurement 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 the secretary of state in her speech to the oxford farming conference speak about the plan for change   which be go to include a commitment to public sector procurement but that be in january and we be now in march with the closure of the basic payment scheme and the ending of the sustainable farming incentive farm income be under real cash pressure in the here and now so when will we hear more detail about the very welcome commitment that the secretary of state make at the oxford farming conference in january 
 as i say in response to my hon friend   the member for st austell and newquay noah law the thing we need to do be establish how much we be actually buy and that be now in progress i absolutely get the point about the urgency the question be why do this take the previous government so long when they share our ambition we be determined to make this happen 
 what step he have take to help protect community that be vulnerable to flooding 
 what step he have take to help protect community that be vulnerable to flooding 
 repair and rebuild our flood defence be a priority for this labour government and we be invest at a record level to improve flood resilience well protect property by this time next year 
 the environment agency allocate its budget to carry out work on flood defence on the basis of a funding formula but that formula do not give sufficient weight to agricultural land will the minister undertake a review of the formula so that agricultural land get the flood defence it need 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue i completely agree that the previous flooding formula do not work for rural community which be exactly why we be consult to change it the consultation will be announce shortly and i encourage he and every member across the house to get involve in shape the formula so we can make sure it deliver the right outcome for everybody up and down our country 
 i thank the minister for visit lilford in leigh after the devastating new year ’s day flooding we have a public meeting on saturday and month after those flood resident be still struggle to get any real progress from their insurance company while other face extortionate premium and excess fee what discussion be the minister have with the insurance industry on improve how they support resident 
 it be a pleasure to see my hon friend and see how tirelessly she be champion and support her local constituent after such a devastating flood concern around flood insurance have be raise so the flood resilience taskforce be set up an insurance sub group through which some of its member will   deep dive into the challenge and opportunity for improvement on flood defence if she have any further evidence that she would like i to look at it would be very helpful to receive it 
 what discussion he have have with thames water on its financial viability 
 i be of course have conversation i can reassure the hon gentleman that the company remain stable and that the government be closely monitor the situation 
 datum publish this week in the guardian reveal that more raw sewage be discharge by thames water last year than in the previous month thames water be rack up billion of pound of expensive extraordinary debt while continue to pump tonne of sewage into our river despite bold target and kind word there be simply no action on clean up our river what will the government do to improve thames water ’s performance 
 the government be take step to improve the performance of all water company include through the water special measures act which i speak about early sir jon cunliffe be lead a review of the entire sector so that we can reform regulation and if need be the regulator to ensure that they be fit for purpose 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 our river lake and sea be awash with pollution the public be rightly furious about leak pipe and sewage spill and we have not build a new reservoir in this country for well over year after year of failure this government be turn the tide the water special measures act be create strong regulation to hold water company to account we have secure over £ of private sector investment the large such investment in the water sector in its history to upgrade our infrastructure last week the water minister my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy and i tour the country from windermere to the wye from hampshire to yorkshire and from suffolk and northumbria to somerset to see where that investment will build new home create thousand of new job and boost local economy this be a cornerstone of our plan for change thing can only get clean 
 in february lucy manzano of the dover port health authority come before the environment food and rural affairs committee and warn that if funding be not confirm before the new financial year check at our border would stop with the new financial year fast approach and another case of   foot and mouth in europe will the secretary of state confirm that the government have finally secure that funding or will we be more at risk in april 
 we take border security extremely seriously that be why we have the btom border target operating model system which we be very closely monitoring to make sure it be do the work that it need to do and why we be invest money in the national biosecurity centre in weybridge to ensure it do not fall into dilapidation which be where it be head under the previous government 
 the conservative party allow the river and lake in my constituency to be pollute with raw sewage while water bill rise and rise do the secretary of state agree with i that as he just say after year of conservative neglect thing can only get clean 
 my hon friend be absolutely right over the past year thing only get filthy this government will turn the tide thing will get clean thank to the investment this government be bring in 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i welcome the secretary of state back to the chamber he have be in hiding for a week we be so worried about he that we be go to start a where ’s wally competition the reason he have be in hiding be that he be duck scrutiny of his dreadful decision to stop the sustainable farming incentive farm payment scheme immediately without warn conservative members have be inundate with message from farmer say that business will not survive this late assault by the government how many farmer will be bankrupt as a result of the sfi stoppage 
 there be unfortunately record level of bankruptcy of farm business under the previous government in which the right hon lady be a member of the cabinet under this government we have more money in the hand of more farmer through sfi than at any point under the previous conservative government this government understand that when a budget have be fully allocate you stop spend the party of liz truss prefer instead to keep spending bankrupt the economy and send mortgage spiral that be not good for farmer for the economy or for anyone 
 the secretary of state can not find his way around a farmyard he be certainly not speak to farmer we conservatives know that if the government continue to tax tax tax business they will break his answer show why we have see cold fury in the countryside at his impotence in stand up to the chancellor on compulsory purchase order the massive cut to de link payment the stopping of capital grant and sfi and of course the family farm fax ahead of next week ’s emergency budget and spending review and give that the guardian seem to know more than he do will the secretary of state guarantee that his government ’s budget will not face far swingeing cut 
 the problem face farming be that it become unprofitable because of the action of the previous government who undercut farm business in trade deal undercut farmer on welfare and environmental standard and raise barrier to export to the european market cause export to plunge by since which lead to record number of bankruptcy this government have a plan for change that involve turn farming into a profitable set of business include by back british business through public sector food procurement and rule out trade deal that undercut farmer in the way the previous government be happy to do 
 i declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on cat the animal welfare committee ’s report in september highlight an urgent need for further regulation around the breeding of cat after it uncover the deeply concern trend in demand for cat and other animal that be breed with extreme characteristic will the minister set out how many of the report ’s recommendation the government have take up and what their timeframe be for implementation 
 i be sure that my hon friend ’s cat who i be tell be call clem cattlee and mo meowlam will be delighted to hear that the government be look very closely at the animal welfare committee ’s opinion on the welfare implication of current and emergent feline breeding practice i can assure they that we be carefully consider the committee ’s recommendation 
 farmer in north norfolk be an incredible bunch who have show resilience through tough time and be still innovate and diversify but there be more tough time ahead what thing do the secretary of state think my farmer should be do to secure their future in the face of so many challenge 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right look ahead the future can be very exciting for farming but as the secretary of state say we have to establish farming as a profitable sector we will work with the hon gentleman ’s farmer to ensure that vision be realise 
 my constituent in burghfield bridge have suffer for year with the devastating effect of flooding and be rightly frustrate that nothing be be do will the minister meet i to discuss flood resilience and well join up of local agency in burghfield bridge and across my constituency 
 i thank my hon friend for raise concern around flooding we have today hear about those concern up and down the country i would of course be happy to meet she 
 after many year of rise cost for scottish pub they now face be unfairly catch up in   the double jeopardy of extended producer responsibility as bottle go to pub be be class as household waste by the department for environment food and rural affairs even though almost no glass bottle deliver to pub end up in household waste give the extremely tight margin on produce bottled beer the situation threaten to cause serious harm to this part of the industry will the minister consider an epr exemption for pub and other hospitality venue or some kind of easement to help the situation 
 we be introduce the big set of change to the regulation in year we be look at the issue of dual use but the real prize with glass be of course to get to a reuse system instead of a recycling system i have be in touch with the drink company to look at how we speed up the start of that 
 labour lead nuneaton and bedworth borough council have buck the national trend in fly tipping with a reduction in the borough of more than while total report incident have fall by on the previous year meanwhile neighbour conservative lead north warwickshire borough council serve only fix penalty notice in the year do my hon friend agree that the action take by nuneaton and bedworth borough council demonstrate that council can reduce fly tipping incident and that north warwickshire must do more to stop the scourge of fly tipping on our country road 
 i have travel along those country road near coventry many time my hon friend be right this be a political choice that council can make i urge people in the upcoming election on   may   to vote for more labour county councillor who will take this scourge seriously 
 last month more than litre of diesel spill into the river wandle from a transport for london garage in the secretary of state ’s previous constituency will the secretary of state meet i and my hon friend   the member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean   to discuss what can be do to restore the wildlife and to ensure that that can not happen again 
 i agree that what happen on the river wandle be shocking it run very close to my constituency as well so i be aware of the situation the environment agency be investigate and if there be inappropriate behaviour there will be swift action i would be happy to arrange an appropriate meeting for the hon gentleman 
 for far too long the people of newcastle under lyme have have to live with the consequence of walley ’s quarry landfill site with the operator walley ’s quarry ltd now in liquidation may i urge the minister to do all she can to make sure that those who cause the mess be force to pay to clean it up 
 we be disappoint that walley ’s quarry have enter administration the environment agency have attend the landfill site assess it and   decide that it do not pose an immediate risk but of course we be liaise with specialist contractor to look after the site and we be in close contact with the environment agency to recoup those cost

 the solicitor general be ask 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate in case of violence   against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate in case of violence   against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate in case of violence   against woman and girl 
 early this month we mark international women ’s day and it be very move to hear the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips again record in this house the name of woman and girl who be kill in the past year the scale of violence against woman and girl in this country be completely intolerable which be why under our plan for change this government have already take concrete step to tackle it include the introduction of raneem ’s law to put domestic abuse expert into control room 
 i thank the solicitor general for her answer yesterday i speak to of my constituent when she be she be rap by an adult whom she should have be able to trust she wake up to he rap she she have be carry that with she for decade year ago she report what happen to she and she have be fight for her day in court all of that time can the solicitor general please set out what the government be do to fix the broken system that be fail to deliver justice and will she meet i to discuss how we can well support victim survivor such as my constituent 
 i be very sorry to hear of the case that my hon friend raise as he know this government inherit a criminal justice system in crisis with a record crown court backlog mean that far too many victim such as his constituent be wait too long for their day in court as part of the domestic abuse joint justice plan in his local area the crown prosecution service be trialle an enhance partnership between merseyside and cheshire police and cps prosecutor to ensure that charge decision include in rape and serious sexual offence case be make more swiftly and strong case be bring from the outset with a view to quicker and more successful prosecution 
 as a former chair of north ayrshire women ’s aid i know how low the prosecution rate be in case of violence against woman and girl and how they can discourage people from come forward at all victim withdrawal from prosecution be also very high for myriad reason from poor treatment to long waiting time for court date what work be be do to make   woman feel more comfortable to come forward and report such case and to support they throughout the whole process 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s work in this area she be right to raise the extremely important point of victim attrition which be unacceptably high right across our united kingdom that be why we have take swift action in england and wales through the cps victim transformation programme appoint victim liaison officer to support victim throughout the legal process the scottish labour leader anas sarwar have also pledge to make this issue a priority as part of his new direction for scotland 
 control and coercive behaviour be an insidious form of abuse will my hon and learn friend please outline what the government be do to deal with it 
 insidious be the right description we fully recognise just how damaging that form of abuse be and that it can follow a pattern of escalation that can lead to violence that be precisely why the joint justice plan be underpin by a commitment to tackle all form of domestic abuse ensure that police and prosecutor can jointly tackle coercive control the court of appeal recently increase sentence for control and coercive behaviour by way of the unduly lenient sentence scheme which i hope send a very strong signal about just how seriously such conduct will be take 
 can the solicitor general confirm that it be imperative that prosecution rate for all case of violence be increase and that she be not suggest to the prosecute authority that they should discriminate on the ground of gender 
 i can confirm that this government and the cps take seriously prosecute all crime include the most serious one equality before the law be a fundamental principle that underpin the rule of law and be foundational to this country 
 many victim be so traumatised after an assault that it take they some time to come forward that cause delay and allow perpetrator to erase their trace what more can we do to encourage any victim of assault to come forward as quickly as possible know that they will have support as soon as they report something 
 the hon member raise an important point the cps be work right across the country to ensure that victim feel more able to come forward and that its service to victim improve she will understand that the court backlog be key unfortunately we inherit a record court backlog from the previous government and we have to tackle it the lord chancellor be take a range of measure to get it down so that victim will have the confidence that when they come forward they will have their day in court and justice will be do 
 in surrey alone there be case wait to be hear in our crown court include sexual offence against woman and   girl prosecutor have be tell victim that they have between and year to wait to get their day in court that be appalling will the solicitor general talk to the ministry of justice to reopen woking ’s court complex which be close by the conservative government to provide great legal capacity in surrey 
 the hon member be right to suggest that the root cause of the backlog be a direct result of conservative choice and inaction the previous government close more than court building in year alone the tories close magistrate court which clearly lead to this considerable court backlog i be pleased to say that the lord chancellor be take action on that backlog by fund sitting day in the crown court and increase magistrate court sentence power 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to use technology to help improve efficiency in the criminal justice system 
 new technology have the potential to bring transformative benefit to the criminal justice system as indeed it do to public service more broadly the government recognise that technology have the potential to radically enhance the way in which public service be deliver to the benefit of all of we and the public purse for example the serious fraud office be trialle technology to improve the speed and quality of its disclosure work the result have be promise the tech identify relevant document more quickly than traditional method i be pleased to say that it will be roll out to more case in the come month 
 my constituency be home to prison lindholme hatfield and moorland give the challenge face in our local criminal justice system particularly in managing caseload in prison and capacity will the solicitor general outline what specific technological innovation be be prioritise to speed up court process and improve access to justice for victim and defendant 
 the work to improve our public service have to include the well use of technology the government be take decisive action to enable law enforcement agency and prosecute authority to harness innovative and cut edge technology to reduce the court backlog improve efficiency in the criminal justice system and lead to well outcome for victim i be pleased to say that the government legal department be provide leadership in this area through its artificial intelligence centre of excellence which offer expert support to colleague across government 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 with shameful vandalism of building in eastbourne ’s gildredge park and the torching of park bench in shinewater park reflect across the country we clearly need more tool to tackle such crime in eastbourne and beyond   technology be of those tool will the solicitor general share with my constituent what tech the government be set to deploy to help we address those crime more efficiently through the criminal justice system 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his question as i outline tech be incredibly important to help the entirety of the criminal justice system function well the cps for example be commit to deliver more technology enable way of working include pilot digital jury bundle which will help speed up the court process i have already mention the serious fraud office which be trialle technology in a number of different area include its case management system and i have also speak about the government legal department the key be well use of technology to enable well way of work across the entirety of the criminal justice system include in the court and especially by the cps to enable more prosecution 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of serious and violent crime in huddersfield 
 the government ’s priority be to keep our street safe and to crack down on the serious and violent crime that unfortunately plague far too many community right across the country as well as commit to more police officer and police community support officer on our street we have take swift action to tackle knife crime by create new offence and penalty to deter the possession and sale of these barbaric weapon our flagship crime and policing bill will go even far with the big package of measure on crime and police for decade 
 make sure that town centre such as huddersfield ’s be safe and thriving be important to our resident local business and the night time economy how be the solicitor general ensure that the cps work effectively with local law enforcement to bring offender to justice and make our resident feel safe in our town 
 i know my hon friend have raise those important issue on the floor of the house previously i also know how hard she be work to ensure the safety of resident in her area 
 too many town centre and high street be plague by antisocial behaviour and shoplifting those crime be too often dismiss as low level but community have to deal with the consequence this government be take action we be put an additional police and pcso on our street and introduce respect order to ensure that disruptive antisocial behaviour be eradicate from our town centre i have be visit local cps unit around the country and have see at hand their hard work to ensure that crime be successfully prosecute and that perpetrator be put behind bar 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 the independent review of the southport attack condemn the cps and police ’s near silence follow the attack and establishe silence as a catalyst for medium disinformation and public distrust it state that silence 
 in the face of horrific event of major public interest be no long an option 
 do the solicitor general accept that government secrecy fuel conspiracy theory and thus erode confidence in our justice system or be the independent king ’s counsel wrong 
 madam deputy speaker you will not be surprised to hear that i completely reject the allegation of government secrecy certainly when it come to southport those murder be some of the most harrowing in our country ’s history and it be absolutely right that due process be follow to allow for the successful conviction it be vital that justice be do in those case 
 the shadow solicitor general will know that there be issue around contempt which the law commission be look at the law commission have agree to a request from the home secretary to speed up that review and it be vital that we get the result of that review as soon as possible 
 the independent review warn that government silence 
 risk far more prejudice to any trial 
 than transparency indeed as be often say the truth can be the good disinfectant will the solicitor general therefore agree to great transparency around major event in future and to implement jonathan hall ’s recommendation on the provision of information to the public to ensure that that never happen again 
 the shadow solicitor general refer to jonathan hall and the terrorism review terrorism be of course something that the government take extremely seriously jonathan hall ’s review have now conclude and it be right that his report couple with the contempt review be consider in full by the home secretary as an important step in address all those question 
 what step she be take with the crown prosecution service to help ensure the effective functioning of the court 
 what step she be take with the crown prosecution service to help ensure the effective functioning of the court 
 this government unfortunately inherit a record crown court backlog with the human impact feel most severely by victim lengthy delay be much too common and victim attrition much too high the lord chancellor have set out swift action to address that include by increase the number of crown court sit day and increase magistrate court sentence power to take pressure off the crown court 
 the effective functioning of the court rely on sound and sensible sentencing guideline in just day such guideline will no long exist and a tier sentencing system will come into force on the solicitor general ’s watch this be the time that the issue have be raise by the opposition i hope we will have more luck in secure a direct answer from the solicitor general do she agree with the justice secretary that the guideline will bring in a tier sentencing system and can she confirm once and for all what be be do to stop those sentencing guideline from come into force 
 i remind the hon member that the conservative sentencing minister at the time write to the sentencing council make it clear that they welcome the new guidance equality before the law be core to the application of the rule of law in this country and a foundational principle of our legal and judicial system i be sure that colleague will welcome the fact that the lord chancellor meet the chair of the sentencing council last week and they have a constructive discussion around the guideline 
 justice delay be justice deny will the solicitor general confirm that the court backlog be rise rather than fall and can she explain why the lord chancellor have not maximise the number of sit day so that victim of rape and other serious crime do not have to wait unduly for their case to be hear 
 the criticism would carry a little more weight be it not for the fact that the conservatives spend the last year drive up the record court backlog the root cause of the backlog be a direct result of the conservatives choice the previous government close over court building and the record court backlog now stand at case as we have say the human cost of those delay be considerable victim be wait year for justice the lord chancellor be take robust action she have increase the number of crown court sitting day increase magistrate court sentence power and ask sir brian leveson to lead an independent review of our criminal court to look at option for long term reform the previous government do not act they drive up the backlog this government be take action 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 as the solicitor general say the lord chancellor have substantially increase sitting day the lack of a judge be only reason that court stand empty in the month of crown court trial be render ineffective because the prosecutor fail to attend what discussion have the solicitor general have with the cps on improve prosecutor attendance so that crown court can sit close to judicial capacity 
 my hon friend raise an important point the shortage of counsel be indeed a problem and have contribute to the record crown court backlog the crown prosecution service be widen their panel include for rape and serious sexual offence counsel i have have regular discussion with the chair of   the bar council around its work to try to ensure that criminal practitioner continue to stay in that line of work i be also conscious that ministry of justice colleague be very much committed to the sustainability of the bar and be have regular discussion 
 the previous conservative government preside over a justice system where of rape victim abandon their case primarily due to the delay in court proceeding this government have prioritise victim by allocate a record number of sit day do the solicitor general agree that despite opposition member expression of outrage their government fail to tackle the backlog and deliver timely justice to victim 
 my hon friend be absolutely right as i have say a number of time the root cause of the backlog lie with the conservatives not take action it fall to this government to take action and it be action we be take 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of serious and violent crime in west ham and beckton constituency 
 we be take strong action as part of our plan for change to tackle the serious and violent crime on our street our new crime and policing bill will back our police and prosecutor by give they enhanced and tough power to keep our street safe to tackle antisocial behaviour and to crack down on knife crime i know my hon friend will also welcome the record £ investment in the metropolitan police from the home secretary and the mayor of london which will help deliver this government ’s safe street mission in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 my constituent in west ham and beckton be extremely concerned about knife crime we have have a serious number of incident over the last few year include in the last few week could my hon and learn friend reassure my constituent on the work that the government be do to take a strong approach on prosecute knife crime and the work be do to support victim 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this important issue this government have already ban machete we be introduce legislation that will clamp down on the sale of dangerous knife online and we be commit to ban ninja sword too i recently meet the cps ’s victim transformation programme and hear how the cps be fundamentally transform the way it provide support to victim to ensure that they get the assistance they need at every stage of the criminal justice process 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of serious and violent crime in luton south and south bedfordshire constituency 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that question the government be take decisive action to crack down on serious and violent crime right across the country and to ensure that perpetrator of such offence be put behind bar as such i welcome her strong support for the crime and policing bill which contain tough measure to tackle knife crime and other crime 
 sadly bedfordshire police record some of the high knife crime rate in england in the year end march a robust and quick cps response be key to deliver justice for victim and their family how be the government ensure that we increase prosecution rate for those serious offence to keep dangerous offender off our street 
 my hon friend raise a critical issue that affect community in bedfordshire and across the country an important part of the government ’s mission to make our street safe be our commitment to halve knife crime in a decade we have implement our ban on zombie style knife and machete and we be move forward with our plan to ban ninja sword later this year we know that more need to be do to tackle the sale of knife and offensive weapon online which be why we have recently announce ronan ’s law which will include strict rule for online knife sale

 i call the shadow leader of the house 
 thank you very much indeed madam deputy speaker i hope that you and the house will excuse i if i start on a very personal note 
 almost exactly hour ago my father torquil norman die at the age of he be an extraordinary man he fly seafires and sea furies during his national service in the fleet air arm he create polly pocket a toy that have bring unbelievable joy to many young people around the house and around the world he rebuild the roundhouse in chalk farm in london not just as an incredible perform art centre but as a creative centre for young people from whatever background to be able to find their way into job 
 the reason i mention that now be that my father stand for value that bear a wide consideration in this house and in our own life value of positivity and creativity he always say that the secret to success in the toy business be to have a mental age of and an eye for detail he have incredible energy but also amazing resilience and focus on the long term turn up at the finish line be of his maxim even in his 80 he be build and create a new enterprise to   develop flat pack truck if you can imagine such a thing madam deputy speaker that could be sell to country around the world at low cost support business and people 
 i think the whole house would agree with i that we need these value today at a time of difficulty stagnation and international conflict we need these value of creativity ambition drive respect for other and above all capability a focus not just on the head but on the hand and the heart as well that be something i feel very strongly about we be try to build a new specialist technical engineering college in hereford precisely to bring those different aspect of the human personality together in the service of well job and well possibility 
 i also think that it encourage we all as a house and as a parliament to ask the right question and to support long term solution even when those question and solution may not be one that we be ideologically or politically draw to we be in a world where welfare cost be rise high than anyone could have want civil service effectiveness be perhaps not as great as we would like productivity in the nhs be not what we would all want for whatever reason that may be over a very long period and we need a rapid boost to our defence and security those be crucial question that we as a house will need to continue to develop and discuss over the next few year 
 i want to ask the leader of the house whether we and other members of the modernisation committee can not expand our thinking about those long term issue and try to push for more scope for co operation between the party on they more consultation and debate on key legislation before it be bring to the house and more way to develop close personal engagement between member so that we can build respect and co operation across the house for the long term of my father ’s maxim you will have discover that he have many be the secret to success be to take a large bite and then chew it i think that we could perhaps do that more as a house and as a country 
 before the leader of the house respond i wish to put on the record my condolence to the right hon gentleman and my love and prayer he and i spend some time together in a department he be a top gentleman to work with and his father will have be very proud 
 i thank the shadow leader of the house for that tribute to his father torquil norman i do not know he but he sound like a wonderful father someone who invent child ’s toy but also who have great wisdom and give he great advice we in this house should all live by those value of positivity creativity and resilience that the right hon gentleman so fondly share with we i send he and his family my very good wish as i be sure the whole house do as he come to term with that in the come day 
 i want to congratulate newcastle united i would not normally but they do win their silverware in year it be also great to see that the tour de france in will start in edinburgh and make its way through england and wales 
 as international event yet again dominate i be sure we all look with horror at the unfold situation in gaza in particular with aid be withhold and the   killing continue as the foreign secretary will set out to the house shortly we want to see an urgent resumption of the ceasefire and the long term peace talk continue 
 in the spirit of the right hon gentleman ’s contribution i want to put on the record my thank to he for the cross party work that he and i do across the house not just through the modernisation committee but on the house of commons commission chair by mr speaker and the many other board that we have to sit on for many hour indeed he make a really important point and it be of the reason why i want to establish the modernisation committee i could have come into this position as leader of the house and just lay down motion which i do on many day to change the rule of the house but that be not how i want to work 
 i take very seriously my role as leader of the house and as such i represent the whole house and want to bring the house together i want to hear from small party and to work cross party i believe that in this place we work well when we work together cross party on select committees and on issue that unite we many of those issue be raise regularly with i in business question and i join the right hon gentleman in say that we could definitely do more to tackle the big issue that this country face whether that be our defence and security the welfare reform that be need job of the future or social care that might be raise with i again today long may that continue and we should strive to do more of it 
 i add my condolence to the shadow leader of the house polly pocket be still go today my granddaughter be a polly pocket fan and my daughter still have all of her

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i extend my condolence and those of my party to the shadow leader of the house on the passing of his father he sound like an amazing man who will be miss not just by the right hon gentleman but by many across the country 
 yesterday in response to a question about welfare reform from the mother of the house the prime minister highlight the importance of get young people into work he say 
 i think that in young people not be in education or training be a moral issue ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 i could not agree more about the importance of education and training but i gently suggest that some of the government ’s own policy be fight against that 
 anglia ruskin university have a campus in the heart of my chelmsford constituency its relatively new medical school be do fabulous work teach the doctor and medical professional of the future member of the workforce that we desperately need in our nhs it be do that in new way when i visit aru just a few week ago i meet of the apprentice take part in the only medical doctor apprenticeship of its kind in the country that apprenticeship be aim at get more young people from disadvantaged background into medicine and it be structure in such an innovative way that those apprentice will remain in their local area to complete their foundation training that mean that they will have a familiar local support system around they as they progress it be an excellent programme and exactly what we need to recruit train and retain young medical professional but it be a level apprenticeship and the government be scrap they as this be clearly a moral issue for the prime minister will the leader of the house ask the government to think again and provide hope that brilliant programme such as that can continue 
 i thank the hon member for that question and for pass on her condolence to the shadow leader of the house she be right that get young people into work be a priority for the government and it be important for the country that we do so we need to reform the apprenticeship system so that more apprenticeship be available for young people but that be not the system we inherit in the system we inherit the apprenticeship levy be underuse and underspent and apprenticeship start be fall that be why we be create skills england and reform the apprenticeship levy so that the young people she talk about can get the help they need 
 notwithstanding the case the hon lady raise i be sure that she will recognise that the vast majority of level apprenticeship be be use by people later in their career who already have degree and who want management training so we have have to look at whether that be sustainable and right however she raise an important point about a scheme in the university in her constituency we need to get more young people into medicine especially those from disadvantaged background and i will ensure that that particular offering be look at and that she get a full reply 
 may i too offer my condolence to the shadow leader of the house i concur with what he say as a parliament we be well when we collaborate

 i be sorry to hear about the case my hon friend raise she be right that our trade union representative do an important job in our workplace provide a link between employer and employee and ensure that people have the standard and right that they be entitle to at work and that they be work in healthy and safe environment i will ensure that the case she raise be look into we be take step to ensure that academy chain be hold to account in the same way as local council

 in addition it would be much appreciated if we could be advise of the date for the estimate day debate in may unfortunately house business seem to completely disrupt the meeting that we be mean to have but i send a letter to the leader of the house about potential opportunity for minute general debate when government business be likely to finish early 
 last week i host a meeting in this place of rotary international representative on the eradication of polio across the world we hear from dr hamid jafari from amman gulcheen aqil from pakistan and aziz memon from pakistan as well as dr sir emeka offor from nigeria   we have invest million of pound in try to eradicate polio across the world unfortunately the new international development minister be not able to attend because of short notice of the change of ministers and we understand that we also know that there be a reduction in overseas aid which i make no comment on however we want to see a statement from the international development minister on which programme will be preserve and which one will be cancel at the moment there be only country in the world afghanistan and pakistan where polio be still rife if we cut those programme the risk be that polio would rear its head again across the world and all the money we have invest would be waste can we have a statement next week on that particularly important subject 
 mr blackman you be the last person i should be chide for use a member ’s name not their constituency in the chamber 
 obviously i would never cross   the hon member for strangford jim shannon of course not his criticism or praise be very important to i 
 as ever   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman   outline some really important debate that the backbench business committee be facilitate i will look very kindly on   thursday april   and on the tuesday before the recess in the usual way and i hope that our meeting can be rearrange very soon

 my condolence to the shadow leader of the house and his family 
 as a physiotherapist prior to be elect to this place i be delighted to welcome member of all ally health profession to a roundtable in parliament this week they account for about a of the nhs ’s entire workforce and work tirelessly to improve patient care fundamentally they all agree that ally health profession be sideline and that their role be often misunderstood do my right hon friend therefore agree that we should have a debate in parliament on the importance of ahps and the crucial work that they do in the nhs 
 my hon friend raise a really important matter it be good to see that she be take her experience from her previous job as a physiotherapist and provide strong leadership here in the house on those issue she be absolutely right that ahps provide a huge contribution to our nhs without physiotherapist and other we would not be able to get people well fit and healthy again and able to continue with their life and their work so i absolutely support her request for a debate 
 my condolence to my right hon friend   the member for hereford and south herefordshire   jesse norman interestingly his comment and his eulogy to his father at this particular time bring into stark relief the absence in too many family of positive male role model for many young boy grow up we all ought to be concern about that 
 we have a real problem at the moment because we have not really debate the use of slave labour in product in the uk there be a really interesting point here because in america right now company that have fail to interrogate their own supply chain be be sanction not know be not good enough many of they be actually in use in the uk include in particular a parent company donghai jaisolar technology be be use at the ministry of defence hongyuan green energy which have be sanction by the usa be in use over here and so be jiangsu micoe solar energy other company such as jinko solar and canadian solar be ever present and they be all essentially guilty of the use of slave labour can we have a proper debate about how we can stop that as the americans have be do for some time surely we now need to sanction company that use slave labour to get cheap advantage 
 as ever the right hon gentleman raise an issue that i know he have long campaign on and its implication for the uk he be absolutely right to raise it we should not tolerate slave labour be use in any of the product on sale or be use in this country and we need to do more to expose and have transparency around that i think that would make a very good topic for a debate but i will certainly ensure that relevant minister update this house on how we can have the economic security and transparency to ensure that that do not happen 
 i too offer my condolence to the shadow leader of the house torquil norman sound absolutely great 
 parc bryn bach woman have recently win the welsh cross country championship beat the like of cardiff and swansea run club to lift the trophy will the leader of the house please join i in congratulate this small club from tredegar on its achievement those runner have make their fellow club member include i very proud
