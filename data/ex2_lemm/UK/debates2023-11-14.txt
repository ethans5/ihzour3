my hon friend who i know very well i have visit his constituency in a former life make very good point he be a doughty champion for bexley he follow in the famous footstep of james brokenshire who we all miss and who be my boss at the home office for a long period i be happy to discuss the issue he raise far he make an interesting point about funding go in a particular way it would be wrong of i to make day commitment at the dispatch box but i will take his point away and get official to look at it with interest and i be happy to discuss it far 
 the hon member for putney set out the history of hammersmith bridge in some detail she be right that it be a grade ii list suspension bridge open in and have serve generation of londoners very well for some considerable time however there be a few of her point with which i would gently take issue let we go to the basic the bridge be not own by the government it be own by the london borough of hammersmith and fulham it be not the responsibility of the government even if people have listen to quite a lot of the speech they may not have pick that up 
 the responsibility for maintain the bridge and make decision on its repair lie with the borough it be unfortunate that the bridge have to close to motor vehicle in and then to all user in the reason as we know be that the safety of those use the bridge be deem to be of the utmost priority the assertion be make that the government have do nothing i respectfully invite the hon lady to accept that the government have provide nearly £ of funding to support the london borough to ensure that there be remedial work and assistance on an ongoing basis i set that out to try to correct the record 
 follow the complete closure of the bridge in the dft provide £ of taxpayer money which enable a comprehensive investigation into the overall structure and condition of the bridge through this investment world lead engineer work to develop a complete picture of the issue that face the bridge the work determine the bridge to be in well condition than fear lead to the bridge reopen on a temporary and control basis to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic the department for transport have work closely with the london borough of hammersmith   and fulham and with transport for london to help facilitate the reopening of the bridge to all user in that vein dft establish the hammersmith bridge taskforce which be lead by the transport minister baroness vere as the hon lady outline the taskforce be set up in and have have many many meeting well over since and it be instrumental in provide a forum for interested stakeholder to work together to develop a clear course of action to resolve the immediate safety concern around the bridge 
 i know the hon lady have call for a further meeting of the taskforce i want to try to address that i assure she that when we be in a position to hold a further taskforce meeting it will be to discuss issue of significance or change for the project therefore ensure that it remain a good use of stakeholder time however she will be aware that we have be wait for the business case to be submit and that be clearly the key part 
 the commitment to this project by the dft have not stop at the initial £ support provide to the authority in the most recent tfl extraordinary funding and financing settlement of august we commit to funding up to of the cost share with the borough and tfl of reopen the bridge to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic and then depend on cost to bus and motor vehicle the part of this commitment have already be deliver in march the department for transport approve the business case from the london borough of hammersmith and fulham for the stabilisation work on the bridge which in turn trigger the release of a furth £ of government funding these work will ensure that the bridge remain open to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic permanently with no risk of further temporary closure due to unsafe condition i be pleased to say that those work be due to complete very early in the new year and will provide certainty to the pedestrian and cyclist of barnes hammersmith fulham richmond and beyond that this link across the thames will remain open 
 most recently as all party will be aware the department for transport provide the borough with a further £ for the crucial geotechnical investigation now be carry out at hammersmith bridge which will pave the way for the next stage of the work this bring the total amount of government funding to the bridge to date of up to nearly £ that be exceptional funding 
 the next stage of the project be to strengthen the core and renovate other structurally significant part of the bridge the strengthen phase of engineering work will build on stabilisation work and upon completion will allow the bridge to reopen to all user that should include bus and motor vehicle follow close co operation with tfl and the department the borough have now develop and submit a his majesty ’s treasury green book outline business case for the stage of the work to the department for transport set out the estimate cost range for strengthen the bridge the department be review that outline business case in great detail it be submit in on   april as i understand it so clearly that be an ongoing process   the hon member for putney ask about the hs2 project and the funding relate to it but no decision have be make regard reallocation of fund 
 the hon member for richmond park sarah olney   also raise the local implementation plan it be true that transport for london provide formula funding to london borough for transport project but its budget for bridge project be just over £ to be share between borough that be obviously insufficient to fund this project 
 i wish to inform the house that i have receive a letter from   the hon member for north dorset simon hoare inform i of his resignation as chair of the northern ireland affairs committee i therefore declare the chair vacant i will announce the arrangement for the election of a new chair in due course 
 i would also like to draw member attention to the fact that the book for enter the private member bills ballot be now open it will be open until the house rise today and while the house be sit tomorrow the book will be available for member to sign in the no lobby until pm on both day at which point it will be take to the public bill office and will remain open for signature until the rise of the house the ballot itself will be draw at am this thursday in committee room 
 an announcement set out these and other arrangement and the date when the minute rule motion can be make and presentation bills introduce have be publish in the order paper 
 we now come to question to the chancellor of the exchequer may i welcome the new ministerial team as a whole rather than go through each of they individually 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of maintain the pension triple lock on the economy 
 as a result of the government ’s triple lock the basic state pension be now more than high in cash term than it be in the secretary of state for work and pensions be undertake his review at the moment and i can not pre empt that 
 now that lord cameron have return to the cabinet it be probably a good time for we to remember that the pension triple lock be a liberal democrat initiative the liberal democrat manifesto say 
 we will uprate the state pension annually by whichever be the high of growth in earning growth in price or per cent 
 give that the triple lock have now be operational for more than a decade will the chancellor and his team commit to put the triple lock in the next manifesto 
 nice try the triple lock be a conservative invention deliver by the conservatives and it be something to which we remain committed 
 i welcome my hon friend to her new role give that it be right that we look after our pensioner and ensure that people be well look after in late life it be important that we have the right tax base to fund our pension will she meet i to consider way in which we can make our taxation system more family friendly to encourage more people to have more child and to ensure that we can pay for our pension in the year ahead 
 my right hon friend be a brilliant advocate on these issue and of course i would be delighted to meet he 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of food inflation 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of food inflation 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of food inflation 
 uk food inflation have be drive largely by global factor and have already fall from to and external forecast expect it to continue to fall 
 between march and april the cost of infant formula increase by on average with the cheap formula on the market increase by that be an absolute catastrophe for family who rely on infant formula but a bonanza for the formula company which be make significant profit out of this can the chancellor tell i why he believe it be right for company to profit while family struggle to feed their baby 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to draw attention to the pressure on family cause by very high food inflation in a number of area but i can tell she that the competition and markets authority which undertake a review of the grocery sector early   this year have not yet find evidence that high food price inflation be be drive by weak competition but it be continue its review and look at the supply chain and we will wait to hear what it say 
 recent research show that the most significant decline in uk child ’s height in the global ranking come after the uk coalition government launch their austerity programme in an expert in child growth rate at the great ormond street institute of child health say of that place drop in rank that austerity 
 have clobber the height of child in the uk 
 what lesson have the chancellor learn from the uk government ’s previous disastrous error of judgment in this area and how will he be support vulnerable group in the future 
 the lesson i have learn be straightforward if we have not reduce the deficit by between and the start of the pandemic we would not have be able to help family across the united kingdom with payment of more than £ on average include household in scotland and more than pensioner 
 even if the inflation rate be fall food price be still go up considerably the joseph rowntree foundation reckon that they have go up at least twice as fast as the value of benefit since september at the very least can the chancellor commit to ensure that the department for work and pensions have enough resource to raise benefit at least in line with september ’s inflation rate 
 the secretary of state for work and pensions be do his review at the moment to decide the correct amount by which to uprate benefit if the hon gentleman look at this government ’s record he will see that we take the decision a year ago to uprate benefit by inflation and we commit to £ of measure to help family get through the cost of living crisis 
 food inflation will only get bad if our self sufficiency in food production drop will my right hon friend consider fiscal measure to discourage the transfer of food produce land to other us such as solar industrial installation 
 my hon friend be right to say that our food industry be very important to food security we need to keep the priority constantly under review nature be a very important part of that but so too be food production 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it be good to be address an elect minister this morning the consumer organisation which have describe tesco and sainsbury ’s as commit dodgy practice over food price and loyalty scheme and marks spencer have just post record profit on food sale yet people up and down the nation of the uk be struggle to pay their food bill will the chancellor tell we which supermarket he have hold to account over rise food price 
 i can tell the hon gentleman that we have the supermarket in over the summer to make sure that they be do everything they could to bear down on food price inflation however the correct way for politician to look at this be at arm ’s length we have the independent competition and markets authority which do a rigorous job and often do thing that politician disagree with and it be look at the issue right now 
 in canada ministers meet the large grocery chain to get commitment on stabilise food price other government be do similar thing france ’s finance minister hold extensive talk with the food industry to get it to commit to freeze or cut price on everyday product be it not the case that for people face crush food bill in scotland and across the nation of the uk this westminster government be do absolutely nothing 
 i think £ of support to help family up and down the country include with food price and energy price be a rather different answer from say that we be do nothing 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support the growth of the energy sector 
 since march the government have commit a total of £ in public investment for the green industrial revolution since then the chancellor have announce £ for clean heat and improve energy efficiency and £ for carbon capture usage and storage alongside the launch of great british nuclear and the small modular reactor competition the government have also invest £ in sizewell c. 
 accord to a recent survey of north sea oil and gas operator have reduce spending since the energy profit levy be introduce i therefore welcome recent announcement on new north sea licence and the announcement before the summer of the energy security investment mechanism by which the epl will be remove when appropriate can my hon friend tell i when we can expect a response to the consultation on the esim and what plan this government have to legislate for the mechanism will he meet i to discuss how investor confidence in our home grow industry can be assure far 
 introduce the price floor for the oil and gas industry come from the principle that while it be right that oil and gas company pay a high share of tax during exceptional time it be also right that when price fall to normal level so do their tax rate that be why we introduce the price floor in june and we have extensively engage with the industry since then i know that legislating will provide some certainty we be look carefully at that and will respond soon i will always be happy to meet with my hon friend 
 the labour party and the co operative party have set out a shared ambition for more community own energy that be not new in denmark of wind energy be community own and in germany half of all onshore wind be community own will the government do far more to join that ambition of community own energy here in britain 
 we have ambitious plan for energy generation and our energy security we want to bring community with we and we look at all option as we do so 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of introduce a wealth tax 
 of course the uk do not have a single wealth tax but it do have several taxis on wealth and asset and those generate substantial revenue the government be commit to keep taxis low so that work people keep more of what they earn the government ’s approach to deliver fiscal sustainability be underpin by fairness with those on the high income pay a large share 
 but the burden of tax be increasingly fall on work people ’s income while the rich family in the uk have alone accumulate a combine wealth equivalent to that of half the population research from the university of greenwich show that a wealth tax could generate £ for much need public service so will the government at least put forward a commission to investigate the matter and introduce a fair taxation policy 
 i be not sure whether the hon lady be lobby i or opposition front benchers with her comment but she will be well aware that we do have a progressive tax system in the uk it be important to remember that the top of taxpayer be project to pay nearly half of all income tax in and the top as much as compare with what we inherit from labour in when the top of income tax payer pay and the top pay the tax system be fair and more progressive under the conservatives 
 those who live in home with driveway pay just vat when they charge their car from their home electricity but those who live in terrace house have to pay vat to charge commercially give that those who live in terrace house be often less wealthy will the minister whom i congratulate on his new role meet i and other member of the conservative environment network to look at how we might level out that anomaly 
 my right hon friend be a great champion of such issue in her constituency and beyond i be aware that she have already speak to the chancellor about this issue but i would be delighted as always to meet she and discuss it far 
 the government have do a lot to raise personal allowance for which our party have advocate for many year however give that that be an improvement for people at the bottom end of the income scale will the treasury now turn its view towards hard work middle income family who also want a reduction in their tax burden 
 we appreciate the support for take of the lowest pay people out of pay income tax altogether since an important and significant change i understand the hon gentleman ’s comment but i can not comment far especially this close to a fiscal event 
 i welcome my hon friend to his new post do he share with i the humour that opposition back benchers have proposal for new taxation that the opposition front benchers be try to bat away while those of we on the government back benches be tell the government to cut taxis and our front benchers keep bat that away 
 i thank my hon friend for his comment i be afraid that what we be probably see be same old labour”—we have hear this all before what they be propose do not work in the 70 and it will not work now we be very proud of our tax record particularly take the low pay out of income tax 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister to his place the government have the opportunity next week to right an historical wrong by abolish non dom tax status the chancellor could use that money to get our nhs back on its foot and to provide free breakfast club for all primary age child just as labour have call for be the abolition of non dom tax status under consideration or have the prime minister rule it out again for personal reason 
 the hon gentleman be well aware that there be real danger that what he be propose would make the uk a less attractive destination that be a very important issue the city pay for a huge amount of our nhs for example and non dom taxpayer be liable to pay £ in uk income tax in and invest more than £ in the uk 
 if he will have discussion with the secretary of state for work and pensions on the potential merit of uprating benefit in line with inflation 
 the government be commit to support household with the cost of living deliver over £ of support include uprating benefit by this   year as i have say the secretary of state for work   and pensions be undertake his review and i can not pre empt that 
 figure from the trussell trust show that food bank usage be at its high ever level and over the summer month a record parcel of food be provide to child in scotland alone meanwhile child poverty cost the government £ per year in poor health and educational outcome in order to tackle child poverty properly will the government commit to keep benefit in line with inflation and lift the child cap 
 we understand that thing be really tough at the moment which be why we have put in place £ of cost of live support this year but we also all need to work on bear down on inflation we be see it start to come down but we know it be still too high and we hope we will reach the prime minister ’s pledge of halve inflation because that be the big help we can give to household this year 
 what step his department be take to help mitigate the potential impact of environmental social and governance practice of financial institution on level of investment in the defence sector 
 the secretary of state for defence and my predecessor my hon friend   the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith recently set out that the value within esg practice of financial institution should never undermine capability develop to help we preserve peace and security the treasury recently consult on a potential regulatory framework for esg rating provider which aim to improve transparency and promote good conduct i hope this will address some of the issue that defence company have raise 
 esg be so vital when it come to invest in all our service include defence we be promise that the greening finance road map would come out at the end of then we be tell that the consultation would come out by autumn this year it be still just about autumn and it be yet to come out why be the government kick esg down the road why have they stop care about esg and when will we have the consultation to get a uk green taxonomy sort 
 i thank my hon friend for his question interruption i do i know how much he care about these issue and campaign on they frequently in the house and i commend he for it the government be commit to deliver on a uk green taxonomy to provide investor with clarity on which economic activity should be label as green we expect to consult this autumn the green taxonomy will provide an important tool for enable the supply of relevant and reliable sustainability information for the market and information will come in due course 
 of the thing that concern northern ireland mp be the fact that when it come to defence job and get contract northern ireland fall behind the minister will be aware that thales on the border of my constituency   be recently able to secure its workforce what step can he take to ensure that each region of the united kingdom but especially northern ireland can benefit from defence spending for the workforce we can do the job the same as everywhere else we just need the opportunity 
 i thank the hon member for his question which be incredibly important as he know this government be absolutely committed to ensure that job in the defence sector within an esg framework be protect i be happy to meet he to discuss far the issue relate to his constituency and northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of inflation on the ability of graduate to repay student loan 
 tuition fee have be freeze for and which will help affordability for future graduate for new graduate interest rate will move with the retail price index but will have nothing add 
 i thank the minister for that response but of course interest rate have make matter much more difficult for graduate who can not afford to both pay off their student loan and buy their own property be there anything far that the government can do to help graduate who be struggle to do both of the thing we could do be raise the threshold at which they start to pay back the loan 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the most important thing we can do be bear down on inflation because that will bear down on interest rate which affect we all i would also point to the cost of live support that the department for education be provide for student i would be happy to discuss the matter with he far 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the economic growth rate 
 our policy be increase economic growth as the office for budget responsibility confirm follow last year ’s autumn statement and the spring budget but the only way to secure high sustainable long term growth be to bring down inflation 
 the obr judge the chancellor ’s last budget to have no overall long term impact on the level of potential productivity do he expect the obr to make a similar judgment of his next budget 
 i remind the hon gentleman of what the obr actually say about the spring budget 
 the overall impact on gdp be around per cent in this be the large upward revision we have make to potential output within our year forecast as a result of fiscal policy decision take by a government 
 economic growth in northern lincolnshire will be severely impact if change go ahead at british steel ’s scunthorpe work which will result in redundancy and a massive impact on the supply chain will my right hon friend give an assurance that the government will not proceed with any support for those change until a full economic assessment of the impact on the local area have be carry out 
 i thank my hon friend and indeed my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   for their extensive lobbying on this very important issue i have have meeting with he and she and with many other to discuss it i reassure he that we be absolutely committed to steel production in the united kingdom and to make sure that any change that be necessary support the local community that depend on steel production 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the chief secretary to the treasury   the hon member for sevenoaks laura trott   to her place i look forward to hold she to account 
 last month the chancellor ’s national infrastructure commission say that in order to unlock the billion of pound of private investment that be available to get our economy grow we need a government who can make good decision fast why do the chancellor think his government have be make bad decision slowly for quite so long 
 it might help the hon gentleman if i tell he some of the fact on infrastructure since we make some reform to the asset pool framework in uk and global infrastructure investment by pension fund have grow from £ to around £ and the solvency reform could potentially unlock a furth £ worth of investment 
 that mr speaker be a list of very slow decision still be badly take the labour party have a raft of plan available to help drive economic growth and investment in every corner of our country from speed up the grid to accelerate planning for critically important infrastructure today i be make they available to the chancellor for free would he like they or would he rather call a general election 
 unfortunately nothing be free from the labour party funding plan by increase borrowing by £ a year lead to high bill for family high energy price and high mortgage 
 what step his department be take to encourage pension scheme to invest in the uk 
 what step his department be take to encourage pension scheme to invest in the uk 
 while we be bask in those question would somebody like to answer they 
 in my speech at mansion house in july i announce reform to boost pension increase investment in uk business and improve uk capital market competitiveness those reform could result in over £ a year of additional retirement income and unlock £ worth of investment in high growth business 
 many local authority have give the investment manager for their pension fund a mandate to invest in infrastructure what plan do my right hon friend have to encourage great infrastructure investment by uk public sector pension fund 
 i thank my hon friend for his interest in this issue of course he have great experience of local government work with the former economic secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith who i see be in the chamber we announce major reform in july to help local government pension fund lead the way in the transformation we be look for in particular by send a direction that they should invest in pool worth more than £ that will make it easy for they to have the expertise necessary to invest in infrastructure 
 i welcome the proposal that my right hon friend the chancellor make in his mansion house speech which will increase investment in the united kingdom in his upcoming autumn statement i implore he to build on his budget announcement with a policy that be originally advocate for in a paper by the adam smith institute a think tank i be proud to be patron of as be set out in my entry in the register of members financial interests i implore he to make full expensing permanent and to scrap the hat factory tax 
 i have a very small bone to pick with my right hon friend because when i become chancellor i be hop to say that i be the chancellor who be once an entrepreneur but he pip i to the post however he be absolutely right to say how important it be to have competitive business investment taxis i be very proud in the spring budget to introduce full expensing for year which give we some of the most competitive business taxis in the oecd only other country do that and i will of course keep under review any possibility to extend that tax break 
 be investment not need in the uk give that year of tory rule have result in a £ uk deficit meanwhile independent ireland have a € surplus from its economic growth and investment that be an ireland without the oil or natural resource of scotland which be now about to start a sovereign wealth fund where do the fail crisis hit uk go wrong and independent ireland go right the clue by the way be in the question 
 i find that a very curious question if the hon member be proud of scotland ’s natural resource why do he want to cancel north sea oil and gas exploration which be the very thing that can give family across the united kingdom security from the energy shock we have see from thing such as the invasion of ukraine 
 there be encourage news in that the pension insurance corporation have recently announce that it be go to invest in help to support the building of new affordable home in this city do the chancellor agree that pension fund could be a very important source of capital for develop social rent housing around the country eden housing association south lakes housing and westmorland and furness council for example will he look at the rule and bring in great incentive for pension investment fund to invest in affordable housing across the country 
 we be already work on proposal in that very area broadly speak we have of the most robust and resilient pension fund sector in the world but we be do a lot of work to remove the barrier to invest back into the uk thing such as affordable housing infrastructure and our growth business be area of great potential 
 what step his department be take to increase public sector productivity 
 what step he be take to help ensure value for money in public spending 
 my hon friend be rightly very focused on make sure that every single pound of taxpayer money be spend wisely and i can assure he that the government share that goal in june the previous chief secretary to the treasury launch the public sector productivity programme and we will provide an update at the autumn statement 
 estimate show that the public sector today be less productive than in the environment just before covid do the minister agree that this could possibly be down to a continue more liberal work from home ethic how much be this cost the taxpayer 
 my hon friend be right that public sector productivity must be improve that be exactly what the review be look at and what we will address i look forward to talk to he more about it in due course 
 i welcome the fact that the taxpayer have spend hundred of million of pound on remediation work at the teesworks site in redcar i do not welcome the fact that the asset include of the operate company and ten of million of pound of scrap have be hand over by the tees valley mayor to private company whose owner be laugh all the way to the bank be that really good value for taxpayer money 
 i think these claim have be address by the mayor and i will not have anything furth to say about they 
 what fiscal step he be take with cabinet colleague to help support household in fuel poverty 
 the government have take significant action to help household with rise energy price and the cost of live by provide of the large package of support in europe total £ 
 orkney and shetland have the bad rate of fuel poverty of anywhere in the country provisional figure show that for last winter both orkney and shetland record record level of winter mortality in his new office will the minister bring his colleague together from across government to hear from agency such as thaw tackle household affordable warmth in orkney that be work to tackle fuel poverty because if we can tackle fuel poverty in orkney and shetland we can tackle fuel poverty 
 we be incredibly sympathetic to the right hon gentleman ’s constituent who have suffer a very difficult time that be why we introduce the energy price guarantee which will remain in place until march as a safety net we continue to engage with lot of stakeholder and we be very happy to include the one he suggest 
 what step his department be take to support homeowner with their mortgage 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change in mortgage interest rate over the course of this parliament on household income 
 the path to low mortgage rate as everybody in this house know be through low inflation which be why the prime minister and the chancellor make halve inflation of our priority for this year the late bank of england forecast show that we be on track for that in june lender represent more than of the mortgage market agree to our new mortgage charter which include new flexibility to help customer manage their repayment back up by uk finance ’s advertising campaign encourage anyone worried about their repayment to contact their lender 
 do the minister agree that the good way we can help the next generation of homeowner be to increase the supply of home bring back the help to buy isa and stop the year mortgage share ownership model which only increase house price 
 i thank my hon friend for his question on his point we be increase the number of home and we be optimistic that we will reach our target of deliver new home over this parliament secondly the help to buy isa be close to   new account in but exist holder can continue to save into their account on his point about stop year mortgage it be important to have choice in the market and for people to make those choice for themselves as a government we be commit to support people do just that 
 accord to the centre for economics and business research mortgage increase be expect to cost uk household £ this year and next how on earth do the government defend that 
 as the hon member know the reason why we be in this position be that there be a global phenomenon we be do what we can we be work closely with the bank of england and over time due to the policy of the chancellor the prime minister and this government interest rate will come down 
 i welcome   the hon member for mid worcestershire nigel huddleston   to his post as financial secretary 
 it have be a year since the conservatives crash the economy in so far fix term mortgage have expire leave work people face sky high increase in their mortgage cost for people live in wellingborough for example this tory mortgage penalty mean that household be pay another £ a month on top of everything else in a cost of living crisis the truth be that work people be pay the price for the conservatives crash the economy last autumn do the economic secretary think that be fair 
 i thank the shadow minister for his kind word at least in relation to i 
 it be important to recognise that in the eurozone the united states and the uk there have be broadly similar increase in inflation and interest rate we as a government be confident that our policy will bring those down in due course 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the secretary of state for scotland on the impact of increase in the cost of live on the scottish economy 
 we have announce uk wide support for household include cost of living payment the energy price guarantee and the energy bill support scheme take together support for household be worth £ and be among the large package in europe 
 the institute for fiscal studies recently report that wage in scotland have rise by since compare with in england in the face of a cost of living crisis bring about by the conservative party ’s disastrous mini budget wage simply be not keep up with the cost of living what can the minister commit the government to do next to help make work pay will she for example support labour ’s new deal for work people 
 i be pleased to see this morning ’s figure which show that wage be go ahead of inflation this be very good news and i hope it spread to scotland 
 whether he plan to change the tax status of non domiciled resident in the uk 
 the government want the uk to have a fair and internationally competitive tax system design to bring in talented individual and investment that contribute to the growth of the uk economy non domiciled individual play an important role in fund our public service through their taxation contribution and they pay uk tax on their uk source income and gain in the same way as everybody else 
 the non dom tax status allow people to dodge million in taxis germany france and canada have close their non dom tax loophole can the minister explain to taxpayer in plymouth and across the country why he think it be fair that people who live here do not pay their taxis here 
 as i say in the answer i give some moment ago non dom taxpayer make a significant contribution to uk tax worth £ in with £ more invest the city for example pay half the cost of the nhs 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of mortgage interest rate 
 the government ’s mortgage charter be provide support to vulnerable household and arrear and repossession remain at historic low government support have help real household income rise by year on year in the late datum 
 with the economy flatlining and interest rate remain at and more than likely to remain above next year it simply follow that household disposable income will continue to be squeeze throughout surely the chancellor agree that mortgage interest tax relief must be reintroduce to support household face high interest rate alongside inflation 
 as the hon member have already hear from the chancellor the economy be still grow the late labour market datum show that income be go up at a high rate than inflation so i do not recognise the picture that he paint 
 what assessment he have make of the financial position of household during winter 
 the government continue to stand by household with of europe ’s large support package amount to some £ a household on average across and 
 the minister will be aware that a big concern for rural constituency be the cost of fuel the rac have find that the margin enjoy by the big supermarket on fuel sale in october be double the figure for the year to date at 14p per litre that reflect concern raise by the competition and markets authority that although wholesale fuel price fall in september and october retail price do not what be the treasury ’s assessment of the impact that these high margin will have on household in the come winter 
 fuel duty be a major cost for household and business we recognise that that be why in the spring budget the chancellor extend the 5p temporary duty cut that be a £ saving for motorist worth £ for the average motorist but we always keep these thing under review 
 what step he be take to support economic growth in essex 
 as my right hon friend know the government be commit to support economic growth all over the country but particularly in the wonderful county of essex the recently announce £ long term plan for town will for example provide £ of flexible funding over year to clacton and there be many other measure 
 i welcome my hon friend to his new role i hope that he will know not only that the only way be essex but that essex be a net contributor to the treasury we want more economic growth in essex in a week ’s time we will have the autumn statement so may i give a message to those on the treasury front bench may i appeal to the chancellor in particular to look at lower the rate of personal and business taxation particularly the area of business rate corporation tax and all aspect to do with enable people to keep more of the money they earn 
 my right hon friend tempt i to make tax policy what i will say to she be that she will know that the chancellor always keep these thing under review as do the government indeed we have a fiscal event shortly 
 can i ask the minister why he say he want particularly to support investment and growth in sussex interruption be that the tories revert to type in term of the blue wall 
 order i think it be essex not sussex 
 they be all the same to i 
 have you get a question i do not think an answer be need 
 what fiscal step he be take to support the growth of the life science sector 
 life science be of the chancellor ’s key growth priority area in may he announce a significant new policy package back by more than £ of funding reaffirm the government ’s commitment to support a thriving life science industry 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer life science be incredibly important so will he focus investment on they in project such as bioyorkshire on the edge of my constituency which bring together private public and academic institution for huge benefit right across the board 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the benefit and importance of life science to the country we be genuinely a world leader i be out in boston in the united states see the other world lead area for life science and it be not a patch on ours that be why as an example we be look to support life science through the investment zone programme but as i say they be a key priority for the chancellor as part of his growth agenda 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 as we have a debate this afternoon i will limit my comment to welcome my outstanding new colleague the new chief secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott will brilliantly solve the problem of how we stop the state expand build on the work of her wonderful predecessor my right hon friend   the member for salisbury john glen the new economic secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for hitchin and harpenden bim afolami will single handedly ensure that the city and stock market remain competitive build on the superb foundation lay by his predecessor my hon friend   the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith the job of the new financial secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for mid worcestershire nigel huddleston will be to work out how to bring taxis down follow in the footstep of his excellent predecessor my hon friend   the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins who as health secretary will no doubt be try to push they up 
 there be widespread consensus that growth be essential to the economy with few self employ in the economy post covid and post ir35 do the chancellor agree that increase the vat threshold to £ for new registration would boost growth and be a net gain in revenue term in the   long run 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the support we give to small business as he will know support small business particularly by roll over    the retail hospitality and leisure business rate discount of be a major feature of the autumn statement we will continue to keep under review anything that we can do to help our small business 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 i welcome all the new ministers to their role and wish they well in they the covid inquiry be uncover unsavoury example of government mismanagement we already know that ministers ignore warning that their business loan scheme be vulnerable to organised crime yet the prime minister leave the vault open to fraudster will the chancellor update the house on the late estimate of taxpayer money lose to fraud from the covid support scheme 
 i be happy to tell the shadow chancellor that as of september hmrc ’s compliance effort on covid-19 support scheme which start when the scheme be set up in spring have prevent the payment of or recover the overpayment of more than £ of grant 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that answer but accord to the house of commons library ’s most recent number covid fraud loss total a staggering £ that be big than the fiscal headroom that he have in his spring budget more story be come to light about company with undeclared interest and personal protective equipment contract not deliver to the standard require ahead of the autumn statement will he confirm that the government have also have to write off more than £ from pandemic ppe contract 
 let i say thing we have no quarter with any incidence of fraud we have commence criminal investigation into suspect fraud case and there have be a total of arrest so far let i also say that during the pandemic we introduce £ of support to business and family up and down the country and accord to the late figure from the office for national statistics the result be that our economy be nearly big than pre pandemic while germany ’s for example be only big 
 primary care capital allocation have pull the short straw for decade may i encourage treasury ministers to look across government and with developer retrospectively if necessary to ensure that when we build huge new housing estate the primary care promise in the planning permission be actually provide 
 i will take this question as well because my hon friend have lobby i personally on this issue literally no in this house have work hard on it than he have i have an example of the very problem he be talk about in my own constituency he be right that   it take too long for housing development capital to reach nhs primary care project we will look into the issue carefully 
 in my constituency we be face with the potential closure of vital public service such as cleckheaton town    hall claremont house dementia care home and batley sport and tennis centre ultimately that come down to cut impose on kirklees council of more than £ since ahead of next week ’s autumn statement what conversation have the chancellor have with his colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities to ensure that our local authority be properly fund and the future of our vital public service be protect 
 i be answer a lot of the topical question today because i have a new team i want to reassure the hon lady that we be very aware of the financial pressure that local authority be under i be have extensive discussion with the communities secretary 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 on the conservative benches we all agree that the way to sustainable economic growth without inflation be through business investment it be early day but i wonder whether we have indication of how well full expensing be work for encourage business investment in this country be the chancellor consider make that full expensing permanent next week at the autumn statement 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s interest in the topic of the reason why our productivity be low than germany ’s for example be that it invest more as a proportion of its gdp than we do in the uk improve the rate of business investment be of the most effective way to boost productivity and people ’s real disposable income we be proud of what we introduce in the spring budget and we will continue to see whether it be possible to extend it far 
 london ’s homelessness challenge be at crisis   point more than in londoners be in temporary accommodation that equate to child in every classroom give that in some borough only around of property be affordable for rent on local housing allowance what assessment have the chancellor make of the adequacy of local housing allowance rate 
 with the work and pensions secretary i continue to keep under review all the thing that have an impact on poverty rate we be proud to have make progress in reduce the number of people live in absolute poverty after housing cost by since when it come to homelessness we be invest £ over the next year rough sleeping be down since its peak 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of member ’s financial interests the chancellor have acknowledge that investment trust which make up of all ftse company be be plague by misguided cost disclosure legislation which be make they appear unduly expensive that be restrict investment and do not happen in any other country in addition to   the positive dialogue between we and with the financial conduct authority will he consider support the    reading of baroness altman ’s private member ’s bill in the other place next week which help to address this issue will he also address it in his autumn statement 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s expertise in this area which be of great benefit to the house and to i as i consider fiscal measure as we be so close to the autumn statement i would say that the way that we treat cost in our investment and pension fund industry be not optimal and we need to reform it 
 a short time after the former chief secretary to the treasury the right hon member for salisbury john glen say he be alarm by the amount of tax people be pay he be out of a job be he sack for highlight the government ’s tax burden the high for year 
 my right hon friend   the member for salisbury john glen   do an excellent job and we all salute his brilliant work if he be here now he would remind the hon gentleman that we have the low tax burden of any european country in the g7 
 i know that the chancellor be aware of just how important the whisky industry be to the economy of rural scotland it be very disappointing that the policy of a duty freeze be not continue in the budget can he offer any reassurance that we will return to the policy of duty freeze in the autumn statement and in next year ’s budget 
 we be incredibly supportive of the scotch whisky industry in fact the scotch whisky association be my meeting in post in out of previous fiscal event we either cut or froze duty on whisky and we have act to remove punitive tariff on scotch whisky in the us market it will not be a surprise to my right hon friend that all taxis remain under review and he will not have long to wait until the next fiscal event 
 bank be take advantage of high interest rate to make bumper profit a new poll show that people have have enough with big support for a off windfall tax on bank profit yet the government have choose to slash the surcharge on bank profit be it not time for a windfall tax on excess bank profit to help people who be hit hard by this crisis 
 there be thing i would say in response to that it be important when we talk about bank that we have a globally broadly competitive tax regime and we do not apologise for that in the treasury secondly the hon gentleman should bear in mind that the reduction he talk about in term of the levy on bank be offset by rise corporation tax 
 i thank the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for grantham and stamford gareth davies   for his recent visit to darlington where he open a new branch of darlington building society he will know    from that visit the impact that treasury job be have locally include an additional £ of spending in our local economy do he agree with i that darlington economic campus be a fantastic levelling up project ensure that people can stay local but go far 
 it be a great pleasure to visit my hon friend and open the darlington building society in his town a very prominent business that be important for in service banking facility the darlington campus be an important part of our treasury levelling up agenda and long may that continue 
 more than household in the uk owe an estimate £ in the unregulated buy now pay later sector the labour party have set out plan for urgent regulation of the sector can the minister confirm when the government will do the same 
 this be a complicated area of regulation and we be look at it very closely the consultation close in april and we be work on it because it be very important we get it right but i hear the hon lady ’s concern and will update the house in due course 
 while the shadow chancellor be busy scroll through wikipedia to copy and paste the actual chancellor have to look no far than the new conservatives tax plan which outline scrap the ir35 reform increase the vat registration threshold to £ and deliver on the prime minister ’s pledge when he be chancellor to bring a 1p cut in income tax in 
 i thank my hon friend for add to the litany of option i have in front of i for the autumn statement what i can say to he be what i say in my party conference speech we be commit to lower the tax burden and will do so as soon as it be responsible to do so 
 some of people in chester have a mortgage and they be still bear the burden of the government ’s disastrous mini budget they deserve peace of mind that mortgage rate will come down soon so what be the chancellor go to do about it 
 can i say gently to the hon lady that interest rate have go up by in the uk since then that be just above the united states and just below the eurozone so this be a global phenomenon there be no short cut to bring down interest rate we have to support the bank of england as it bear down on inflation and then we can bring mortgage rate down 
 will the chancellor look at the red tape around the apprenticeship levy many business in my area such as asda amazon and dpd all say that they want to take on more apprenticeship but that the red tape around how they spend the money be very difficult this be something that he could change overnight and really help to grow and boost our economy 
 i thank my hon friend for draw attention to the apprenticeship levy which have be a tremendous success in bring a rigour to technical qualification that be not there before we be very open to reform to the apprenticeship levy provide they stick to the fundamental principle that any investment be not in in house training that would otherwise have happen but in transferrable passport able training that someone can take with they if they move to another business 
 the nhs dental plan have be stick in the treasury for month while my constituent be wait year to see an nhs dentist when the chancellor make his autumn statement will he also release the dental plan with the funding that be require so that we can get dental treatment back on track for our constituent 
 i will not pre empt what i be go to say next week but i will say to the hon lady that as a former health secretary i be well aware of the pressure on nhs dentistry and its importance to all our constituent 
 give that inheritance tax be the least popular of all taxis at every income decile and that scrap it would not be inflationary will my right hon friend consider do so 
 that be a very nice try but my hon friend will have to wait for a week 
 opt out saving be a little like auto enrolment in pension they help those on low income to save for a crisis for the proverbial rainy day give that more than people in this country be in work with no saving at all will the chancellor note the impressive result of a small trial of the opt out saving system in manchester and encourage its expansion 
 i would be happy to do that the hon gentleman be right if we be to grow fast as an economy the other side of the coin be we that need to save more and we should be encourage everyone in all income group to do so 
 will my right hon friend seek to fix the anomaly that see man make fully synthetic fuel tax at the same rate as their fossil equivalent 
 i shall be happy to look into that issue in detail and get back to my hon friend 
 yesterday in the house in the context of labour ’s plan for a health service the secretary of state for work and pensions refer to the poor old non dom do the chancellor agree with his colleague that people who live in this country but do not pay their taxis here can be accurately describe as poor 
 because we attract wealth creator from all over the world and this may be uncomfortable for those on the opposition benches we generate huge amount of tax revenue financial service pay for half the cost of run the nhs i be in favour of get everyone to pay their fair share of tax but i will not make reform that mean less tax revenue for the nhs 
 i call david linden to ask the final question 
 the westminster make cost of living crisis be have a devastating impact on household income particularly in broomhouse where many young homeowner be see mortgage price soar will the chancellor use the autumn statement to introduce mortgage interest tax relief to help people across glasgow to deal with the cost of living crisis 
 as the hon gentleman know we have take enormous step over the past year to help family throughout scotland to deal with cost of living pressure if he really think that people in scotland believe that this be a make in westminster problem when we have experience an invasion of ukraine and a global pandemic i simply say to he in return that after year of snp rule gdp per head in scotland be low productivity be fall employment be low and inactivity be higher—[interruption 
 member need to give i a good reason not to bring they in at the end again be careful let we come to the statement—[interruption angus you ’ll find the door i think in a minute 
 with permission mr speaker i will begin by respond to your helpful statement yesterday 
 the foreign secretary the business manager and i all believe it be essential that this house properly scrutinise the work of the foreign office especially as we face such a daunting set of challenge across the world as minister of state i will follow the precedent set by successive government of different party from the day of lord home and lord carrington to more recent time when lord mandelson serve in the cabinet from the house of lords i will deputise for the foreign secretary in this house make regular statement like today ’s and respect the primacy of this house in the normal way and of course the foreign secretary will appear before the house of lords and relevant committees regularly 
 the terrible event in israel and gaza have underline the critical importance of british diplomacy and development work as israel battle to defeat hamas the humanitarian situation remain extremely difficult as the prime minister say last night israel must respect international humanitarian law 
 with service and communication in gaza under unprecedented strain it be difficult to be absolutely certain about how event be unfold but the report we have have from partner make clear the appalling loss of life include among child and aid worker and the situation in hospital in gaza city notably al shifa be now acute al shifa have hundred of in patient and be able to offer a set of service unavailable elsewhere in gaza report indicate that operation have stop due to the lack of fuel and supply and that premature baby have die due to the lack of electricity fuel be urgently need to power hospital as well as desalinisation plant to ensure access to clean water hospital should be place of safety able to treat patient with compassion it be distress to see they unable to do so every civilian death be heartbreaking and it be impossible to comprehend the pain and loss that innocent palestinians be endure 
 as the house know since   october   the government have be engage intensively with our close ally and partner in the region since my last update to the house i have meet in birmingham on sunday representative of islamic relief who still have humanitarian supply in gaza to hear clearly from they about the situation on the ground and this morning i speak to martin griffiths the head of the united nations office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs i will travel to the region overnight tonight the new foreign secretary have discuss the situation with us secretary of state tony blinken the government will be able to draw on his extensive regional experience in the week and month ahead 
 our goal remain unchanged as i tell the house last week we be focus on get life save aid to those in need in gaza support the safe return of hostage and british national back israel ’s right to self defence and prevent a dangerous regional escalation   our effort have contribute to some delivery of aid via the rafah crossing and to over british national be able to leave gaza safely since i speak to the house last week more british national and their family have leave and we will continue to offer all the support we can to those british national still in gaza so that they too can cross into egypt 
 as the house know we have more than double our aid to civilian in gaza commit £ and we stand ready to do more for over a week british flight carry aid have be land in egypt with shipment include life save item as well as the vital equipment that the egyptian red crescent need to be able to manage donation from across the world effectively we be also urge the israeli government to increase humanitarian access include through rafah and by open up the kerem shalom crossing at this point we assess that land presently offer the most viable and safe way to get humanitarian aid into gaza in the quantity need but we be also consider air and maritime option include through our basis in cyprus 
 the government have be clear that all party to a conflict must afford civilian the protection that be their right under international law that include respect the sanctity of hospital so that doctor can continue to care for the sick and injure event on   october   and hamas ’s subsequent statement have make it clear that they be a terrorist group who pose an existential threat to the very idea of an israeli state israel have a right to defend itself against this terrorist threat to restore its security and to bring the hostage home but there be thing that israel must do as part of its response we have impress this on the israeli government they must act within international law they must take every precaution to minimise civilian casualty limit attack to military target and they must stop extremist settler violence in the west bank at the same time we should be under no illusion hamas have choose to embed themselves within the civilian population and their willingness to sacrifice innocent palestinians in this way only bring home their inhumanity 
 alleviate the suffering be our foremost priority we welcome any initiative that would allow more aid to be deliver and hostage to be release we have therefore consistently call for humanitarian pause hour pause in northern gaza be an important step but long pause that cover wide area will be need we be discuss with the un and other partner how good to achieve this we must avoid measure that serve only to benefit hamas and allow they to entrench their position at the same time we need all party to the conflict to abide by any pause allow sufficient time and security for civilian to move and for aid to be deliver 
 respond to the immediate crisis be critical but we also need to do more to create a new political horizon the whole house know that only answer have come close to create peace in these troubled land a state solution 
 i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 i would have like to have start by welcome the new foreign secretary to his place but i can not do so because he be not here despite my respect for the minister he be not the foreign secretary we do not know when or how this house will hear from the foreign secretary because he be not a member interruption 
 order mr seely be you go to be quiet 
 yes 
 right in which case the shadow foreign secretary may continue 
 david cameron be the foreign secretary in year of tory chaos he be force to resign in failure over a matter of foreign policy the prime minister have look at each of the conservative members and decide that none of they would be well at represent britain ’s interest on the world stage the prime minister claim he be for change but instead he have resurrect yesterday ’s failure with an honour that decision raise serious question for this house but i know you share those concern mr speaker 
 at a time of grave international crisis and at a moment of war in europe with a more assertive china a climate emergency and a horrify conflict in gaza this house need government accountability more than ever will the minister commit to work closely with mr speaker to ensure that the opposition and all member of parliament can hold the foreign secretary to account 
 i turn to the horror of gaza more than palestinians have reportedly be kill with third of the dead be woman and child this be shocking and devastating every civilian death be an equal tragedy do the minister agree that the number of palestinian civilian and child who have be kill over the past month be intolerable and do he agree that israel must make change to how it be fight this war by take urgent and concrete step to protect civilian life 
 i be gravely concern by the desperate report from hospital in northern gaza these hospital be already overstretch with the wound short of fuel and fill with civilian seek shelter doctor be now force to make impossible choice as they try to care for the wounded and newborn without power some of those newborn have now lose their life unbearable 
 medical establishment have special protection under international law they should never be target or use as shield all party must follow international law act with necessity distinction proportionality and precaution allegation of breach should always be treat with the utmost seriousness 
 the minister say last week that the government support the independence of the international criminal court as do the labour party but he fail to answer whether the government recognise its jurisdiction to address the conduct of all party in gaza as prime minister boris johnson reject that jurisdiction and attack the court labour recognise the icc ’s jurisdiction can the minister clarify his government ’s position today 
 gaza be in a humanitarian catastrophe more than people have be displace and there be desperate shortage of basic essential do the minister agree that the short pause in the north be clearly not enough gazan need aid now they need medicine now they need water now they need food now they need fuel now a full comprehensive and immediate humanitarian pause in fighting across the whole of gaza be need now to alleviate palestinian suffering and in order for hamas terrorist to release the hostage 
 hamas ’s state aim be to wipe israel off the map they commit the most brutal attack on jews since the holocaust and now they be use innocent palestinians as human shield i would like to register my shock that not every member of this house can say this truth hamas be terrorist 
 we must not give up on the narrow opening that keep the prospect of peace alive that mean prevent escalation condemn violence from settler in the west bank condemn rocket attack on israel from iran ’s proxy in lebanon and elsewhere and create a future where gaza be not subject to occupation meanwhile international diplomacy evolve and the fact on the ground be change day to day in relation to both hostage be rescue and hamas ’s capability to carry out attack such as we see on   october as the leader of the opposition set out to chatham house we must move to a full 
 cessation of fighting as quickly as possible the reality be that neither the long term security of israel nor long term justice for palestine can be deliver by bomb and bullet 
 we must seek a path to a political process that lead to state a secure israel and an independent palestine 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his comment and perhaps i should start by address those about the foreign secretary have a former prime minister and party leader as our foreign secretary wherever sit in this house must be a plus they will be able to exert british influence and policy highly effectively overseas and i greatly welcome the appointment of lord cameron to the position of foreign secretary as the house will know he be an extremely experienced parliamentarian and i have no doubt whatsoever that the house the foreign office and the government will gain enormously from his presence 
 the right hon gentleman ask i whether i will commit to work closely with you mr speaker and of course there be only answer to that question 
 that be n’t much reassurance be it laughter 
 in addition i will seek to ensure the full possible accountability as you set it out mr speaker 
 the right hon gentleman speak of the scale of death and misery all death of civilian be to be profoundly regret he talk about the scene from the al shifa hospital which will have shock every member of this house he like i will be aware that humanitarian worker who place their life in jeopardy to support their fellow human being have lose their life he ask i about the icc it be not for i to fetter or speak in the place of its chief prosecutor but the right hon gentleman will know that he have speak and will do so again 
 the right hon gentleman call for the hostage to be release and i hope that everyone in this house will echo that he say that hamas be terrorist and suggest that some do not recognise that i agree with he and hope that every member of the house will make it clear that hamas be terrorist a dreadful pogrom take place on   october where more jewish people lose their life in a day than at any time since the holocaust and that piece of information be fundamental to our appreciation of the event to which he refer 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 as of today i be inform that no more aid will reach gaza not because it can not get to the rafah crossing or because it be pile up in egypt but because the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees have no fuel leave and so the aid can not be redistribute so although i really appreciate the government look at maritime and air effort and crucially at the need to open a aid cross to the west bank there be no point it be futile unless we get the fuel to the un will my right hon friend reassure i as to what be be do to change that situation secondly have the foreign office ’s overseas judicial assistance assessment increase since   october yes or no 
 my hon friend ask i about the position on fuel fuel be desperately need today it be go to run out the united nations have be access dirty fuel but now that be at an end and we be incredibly worried about the situation we be talk to the key american humanitarian intervenor mr satterfield about this we be work diplomatically to do everything we can to make sure that the position on fuel be address as we have be do since i last update the house 
 i do not catch the part of my hon friend ’s final question so i will write to she on that point 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 i thank the minister of state for prior sight of his statement but here we be on day of the new fcdo regime and already we see the absurdity of have a foreign secretary who be unable to come to speak in this chamber to elect member at a time of grave international crisis 
 the minister be right to highlight the appalling loss of life in gaza particularly among child and aid worker sadly there be little sign of that end soon as the bombardment intensifie he be also right to say that a humanitarian crisis be unfold 
 a couple of week ago i ask the previous secretary of state whether he have be make aware or have reasonable ground to believe that israel have breach international humanitarian law in its response to the atrocity of   october he steadfastly refuse to answer that question so i ask the minister the same question if he have what representation have he make to the israeli government and what response have he have 
 there can only be a political solution to this crisis and have to be find before the entire region be engulf that be why a ceasefire be essential to end the unprecedented level of killing and destruction allow full humanitarian access secure the release of the hostage and find a political solution that do not include hamas hour pause be not the answer can we expect the new foreign secretary to change tack and support our call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire so that there be space for that political solution to be find 
 tomorrow the house should have an opportunity to show its support for a ceasefire i and every of my snp colleague will be there to support an immediate ceasefire and i would expect labour party member from scotland to be in the lobby with we without justice there can be no peace this horrific cycle of violence will continue and more israeli and palestinian life will be lose 
 the hon gentleman underline the loss of life and the cause of it he know our position on a ceasefire it be a position share by member on the opposition front bench and he also know the absolute commitment we have to try to drive forward pause they must be safe pause for the delivery of humanitarian relief but he know of our commitment on that 
 the hon gentleman ask i about humanitarian law robert mardini the director general of the international committee of the red cross have make clear that gaza hospital treat hundred of wounded people can not be target under any circumstance the hon gentleman will know that the icrc be the guardian of international humanitarian law and the geneva convention and robert mardini have say 
 hospital be to be absolutely protect at all time 
 finally the hon gentleman make a point about a political solution i draw his attention to my final comment in my statement about how we have to focus on that and on the state solution and about the need for hope and opportunity to drive forward the politic in this dreadful situation 
 rise 
 order i expect to allow question on the statement to run for about an hour but because there be so many of the same member wish to speak in the debate on the king ’s speech i hope we can have short question and speedy answer 
 as my right hon friend have say follow the unprovoked slaughter of its citizen israel have a right to pursue and destroy the terrorist force it be terrible that the ordinary citizen of gaza be pay the price for this as hamas would have know but even if israel be able to degrade and destroy the hamas force the hamas mindset will remain a hamas mindset that be fund and support by iran iran do not want there to be peace between arab state and israel because the iranian regime do not want israel to exist when will the government take firm measure member from across the house have ask when the islamic revolutionary guard corps for example will be proscribe and we have never be give a good reason why it be not what be the answer 
 i hear what he say about the irgc and i know that he have already be in contact with the foreign secretary on exactly that point i hope he will accept that we do not carry on a running commentary on issue such as proscription but the house and the foreign secretary have hear what he say 
 i be still not clear whether the right hon gentleman agree with labour that the icc have jurisdiction over the conduct of all party in gaza if he do then that be a very welcome change from the position of prime minister boris johnson will he clarify that 
 i repeat what i say last week it be not for minister to seek to state where the icc have jurisdiction that be for the chief prosecutor the chief prosecutor have not be silent on this matter and i be sure he will continue to express his view 
 whether we like it or not israel will carry on fighting until it have establish control of the area from which it be attack the question that then arise be what happen next if israel simply withdraw hamas will reappear at least moderate arab state believe that a state solution will have to be impose and police be the government giving thought as to who might carry out that job otherwise the outcome that they want a state solution be wholly impracticable 
 my right hon friend be entirely right about that and entirely right that israel have an absolute right of self defence in this matter on the option to which he allude i can assure he that a great deal of thought be go on not only in britain but across the region and elsewhere 
 a last peace and a state solution be the only way to guarantee dignity and security for both palestinians and israelis hamas a terrorist organisation can not be part of that but a month after their contemptable attack on israel it be clear that a military solution be not work it be not remove hamas and instead we have the humanitarian catastrophe to which the minister refer do he agree that the way to achieve that peace and a state solution be to back a political solution with an immediate bilateral ceasefire explicitly contingent on both party adhere to it so that if party break the ceasefire a military operation remain on the table 
 the hon lady be entirely right about the importance of a political solution she know the position of the government and members on the opposition front bench on the issue of ceasefire but i hope she will draw some comfort from the emphasis on extend pause that we be now see on the politic i remind she that the great progress that be make at oslo which bring thing so tantalisingly close take place on the back of the intifada 
 every right thinking person want to see an end to fighting and a durable peace for palestinians and israelis but hamas have make absolutely clear that there will be no such peace so long as the state of israel continue to   exist will my right hon friend say a bit more about what have be happen at the al shifa hospital and other hospital in gaza have he see the report and the footage circulate of hamas fighter use those hospital as basis for operation put civilian live at risk 
 my right hon friend who know a great deal about these matter be correct hamas have make clear that they do not seek a ceasefire and indeed seek to repeat the awful event of   october as far as the al shifa hospital be concern he like i will have see the horrific picture on television last night and i refer specifically to the awful effect on baby that be display 
 recently several united nations expert give a dire warning to the world state they believe that 
 the palestinian people be at grave risk of genocide 
 and that the time be now run out to prevent such a tragedy furthermore they make it clear that israel ’s ally share the responsibility for that and must act now to prevent a genocide from take place give those warning will the minister finally stand with of the british public and call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza 
 we will continue to focus on the importance of humanitarian pause but also try to make sure that when the opportunity of a pause present itself we be able to get critical humanitarian supply to those in desperate need 
 away from the horror of israel and gaza there be an unfold tragedy on the west bank with the killing of well over get on for palestinians by settler and the israel defence forces in his statement my right hon friend rightly urge israel to provide protection from they if the state of israel decline to do so and the killing continue would he consider the intervention of a un peacekeeping force to keep the peace in that part of the world 
 we have condemn the settler violence without qualification on the work of the united nations there will be many opportunity in the future i hope and we will neglect none of they 
 i share what the minister have say about the humanitarian tragedy that we be witness all the time on our television we must try to unlock a process towards peace and the issue of the hostage be key to that what step have he take so far and what further step will be take by the new foreign secretary to ensure that the hostage be bring home i really believe that that could unlock the route to peace 
 i thank the right hon lady for her comment she have speak movingly and with great expertise and humanity about this situation both on the medium and in the house if she will forgive i we can not give a running commentary on what we be do to try to recover the hostage i hope that she will accept my word that we be do everything across government and internationally to try to get they home as soon as we can 
 the director of the fbi have say that hamas pose the great security risk to the united states and the west since isis a decade ago do the minister of state agree with that assessment and what be the government do to work with our international partner to reduce that threat both in the region and here at home 
 the threat of hamas which my right hon friend set out very clearly be undoubtedly true it be part of israel ’s legitimate position that it can exercise its right to self defence and go after the dreadful terrorist who perpetrate that awful act 
 thousand of innocent man woman and child have be kill and thousand more wound in this conflict over the past month as the ground operation and bombing campaign intensifie as encircled hospital run out of power and medicine as baby be leave to die outside their incubator and as more than palestinians remain trap in a never end humanitarian nightmare do the minister agree that the international community must protect civilian if he do why will the government not join i in press for an immediate ceasefire to end the bloodshed allow desperately need aid to reach those most in need and create space for meaningful negotiation and a peaceful resolution 
 the hon gentleman speak with great passion and eloquence on this matter in the house i can do no well than repeat what the prime minister say last night in his speech at mansion house he say that israel 
 must take all possible measure to protect innocent civilian include at hospital 
 my right hon friend and his shadow have speak of hospital i have to tell he that there be now video evidence of suicide vest rocket propel grenade motorcycle use to kidnap israelis to gaza nappy and chair with rope to hold hostage be find in the basement of the al rantisi hospital in gaza the hospital be obviously use by hamas as a command centre and be believe to have hold israeli hostage do my right hon friend agree that use hospital in this way as place to imprison hostage and keep weapon be an outrageous breach of international law 
 yes 
 gaza be face a humanitarian crisis before   october the government cut funding to unrwa from £ to £ the clock be tick hospital be run out of fuel food and water supply be almost deplete and until a large scale humanitarian operation be in place many more people will needlessly die will the minister update we on what progress the government have make to secure a humanitarian resolution through the un security council 
 we be work night and day for humanitarian access on the subject of support for unrwa we increase aid very substantially as the   hon lady know before   october since then we have allocate £ of humanitarian aid and we will do more if it be require 
 several of my constituent have write to i deeply concerned about the loss of civilian life and want the fighting to stop which we all want last week my right hon friend call for israel to take measure to protect civilian i say that we need to see israel take such measure but civilian have continue to die especially in hospital please can he double down on that request to israel to take measure to protect civilian 
 mr speaker if i may in the meantime in sudan 
 order i have ask everybody to be brief so that other people can get in we should not be drive by self centre behaviour 
 my right hon friend make a most important humanitarian point and she may rest assure that the government be seize of it 
 france ’s president macron have call for a ceasefire join other european nation such as spain norway portugal and ireland as well as the un secretary general secure a negotiate ceasefire that be bind on all side will require a huge diplomatic effort so be it not time for our government to add their weight to the push for a ceasefire rather than dismiss out of hand a proposal that have grow international support 
 the hon member will know that in order to have a ceasefire we need both party to agree to it hamas have make it absolutely clear that they be not interested in a ceasefire they make it clear that they want to repeat the action of   october i believe the right position be to press for pause that be the position of the government and of the official opposition 
 i understand that just conservative members have visit israel since   october the prime minister the former foreign commonwealth and development secretary my hon friend   the member for brigg and goole andrew percy   and i last week when i be there i do see evidence of humanitarian protection by the idf force i also see video and photograph of the thing that happen in some of the kibbutzim and they be quite simply crime against humanity do the minister agree that there be no moral equivalence between hamas and the sovereign independent state of israel 
 yes i completely agree with what my hon friend have say he should know that the prime minister and other member of the government have be in continuous contact with prime minister netanyahu include by hold frequent conversation and discussion however i have to say that it would be helpful if all those call for israel to protect hospital would also call on hamas to vacate the hospital and stop use civilian as human shield 
 today alon lee green the director of stand together the large cross community organisation in israel post a video of a soldier in gaza say 
 i ’m on the beach in gaza in gush katif i ’m safe i ’m happy i and my friend conquer beit lahia al atatra and sulatin and we ’re move on and we ’re go to conquer the rest of gaza i ’m safe i ’m happy i ’m enjoy the big opportunity of my lifetime i love you all and i could not be happy to be where i be do god ’s work 
 alon lee green say 
 what ’ go on in gaza do not only go against the palestinian interest it go also against my people interest the jewish israeli interest 
 also today we have danny danon a likud member and former ambassador and ram ben barak a yesh atid opposition member say that israel should expel all palestinians from gaza what be we do to restrain the israeli government and commentator 
 we have always make it clear to israel that we be its close possible friend but friend give candid advice and do not always say what people want to hear the british government will continue with i believe the strong support of this house to make the right point to the israeli government and we be able to do so because of our extremely close alliance and friendship with they 
 the human misery and death on both side israeli and palestinian be the bad i have witness since i become a member of this house and they will be solve only by a long term political solution will my right hon friend with whom i totally agree explain what the british government be do in strategic planning to bring about a state solution 
 there be an immense amount of work go on about how we get to the point where we can achieve that as i set out in my statement there be no alternative to the state solution and all interested party should get behind that 
 i have a dreadful hour labour when give birth to my child but i still consider myself lucky i have medicine water electricity and a function hospital the woman give birth in gaza do not have those thing there be a report of a pregnant palestinian woman who have horrific injury from shell and who then have an emergency c section perform without electricity i know the minister will think that that be unacceptable but what be he actually do to ensure that hospital and pregnant woman be protect by international law 
 we be speak out in every way we can to try to protect vulnerable citizen i quote what president joe biden say yesterday in an oval office address he say that al shifa hospital must be protect and that 
 it be my expectation that there will be less intrusive action 
 israel have make it clear that it have clash with hamas nearby but have not fire on the hospital themselves
