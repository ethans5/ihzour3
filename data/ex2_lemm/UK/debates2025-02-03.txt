i would like to take this opportunity to welcome the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for swansea west torsten bell to his post as pensions minister and to place on record my personal thank to his predecessor my hon friend   the member for wycombe emma reynolds for all her hard work 
 our new public authorities fraud error and recovery bill will update the department ’s power to tackle fraud for the time in more than year include enable our serious and organised crime investigator to apply for a warrant enter and search premise for evidence seize item such as computer and phone and bring criminal gang to justice 
 this government have run the big ever take up campaign on pension credit which be worth around £ on average to those eligible it also open the door to extra support and mean that pensioner will continue to receive the winter   fuel payment the modelled impact of the decision to target the winter fuel payment at those who need it most do not account for the measure that this government be take to raise pension credit take up 
 follow the end of headline judgment in september ofsted undertake the big listen and listen very carefully to feedback on the way it conduct inspection while also review the format for report on those inspection i note the hon lady ’s comment in that regard in the new system that have be design that work have pave the way for the roll out of school report card subject to consultation both the government and ofsted be very open to the view of the profession they will be roll out in september 
 alongside a reform ofsted we be create the rise team comprise of leader with a prove track record of improve school standard those team will draw on bespoke improvement plan for stuck school with significant investment the previous government make £ available for stuck school under this government it will be more like £ per school to drive that improvement 
 the hon lady ’s comment in relation to send be well make as i say to the chair of the select committee my hon friend   the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes that be something that ofsted will be judge look specifically at inclusion as well as not instead of high and rise attainment standard in school the reformed accountability and improvement system very much build on the work of the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill which will require teacher to have or work towards qualified teacher status ensure that all school teach a cutting edge national curriculum follow the curriculum and assessment review and restore teaching as an attractive profession through a floor but no ceiling for pay and condition 
 all those reform combine will drive high and rise standard and break down the barrier to opportunity for every child 
 it be not entirely dependent on our astrazeneca programme and indeed as i have already point out the piece of work in which it be intend to invest i hope i will get the science right be change the way in which it would create the nasal flu vaccine for child from an egg base to a cell base system it have now decide not to do that but to stick to the egg base system i think that if the chief scientific adviser or the chief medical officer have anything on which to update the house he and/or she will do so 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of jobcentre on   economic   growth 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of jobcentre on   economic   growth 
 increase employment and help people into good work be essential to grow our economy which be why our get britain working plan set out our vision to reform jobcentre and build a new job and career service that will meet the different need of local labour market people and business 
 on friday i visit the assessment centre at the west ealing jobcentre where staff tell i the assessment focus on prove that disabled people can not work rather than identify what job they could do if they have the right support many disabled people in my constituency be eager for a good job what more could jobcentre and the department do to help disabled people into work rather than simply write they off 
 i thank my hon friend for meet with department for work and pensions colleague in west ealing and through she thank they for all the work they be do i know she will have be impress by they as i always be 
 disabled people have a right to work like everyone else and it be our job to see that right realise do so will benefit everyone as we all win when people ’s talent and potential be maximise it be good for business and strengthen our economy we be do great thing to bring forward our plan for a new job and career service which will put disabled people at its heart 
 i recently visit jobcentre in my area thorne and scunthorpe and see the great work be do by the staff there our jobcentre should be place where everyone can go for help to get they back into work however many blind and visually impair people need technology such as screen reader to use computer while other might need specialist screen   magnification software research by sense have find that no jobcentre have this specialist assistive technology mean that some disabled jobseeker can not use the computer on site to look for work how will the government ensure that jobcentre be equip with essential piece of assistive technology in the future enable more disabled people to look for work 
 i apologise to my hon friend i could not quite hear which jobcentre he have visit however i thank he for do so and for connect with dwp colleague in that way it be really valuable i ask he to take all our thank back to they 
 as part of the new job and career service we will radically enhance our use of technology so that people can access support through the channel that well meet their need assistive technology can aid the accessibility and inclusiveness of the new service that we be build so we be listen to those who already use it 
 on   january the minister for disabled people my right hon friend   the member for east ham sir stephen timms and i meet colleague from across parliament on the all party parliamentary group on eye health and visual impairment where we have a great opportunity to listen to expert in this field 
 do the minister agree that whatever step her department be take to get people into work be be immediately undermine by the anti growth anti job and anti business measure include in the government ’s employment rights bill 
 i do not 
 will the minister join i in commend the dedication and hard work of our work coach who assist with job application and interview preparation 
 on that i certainly will agree our work coach be absolutely brilliant and they be lead the way in change jobcentre 
 what step she be take to increase take up of pension credit 
 in recent month the department have run the big ever pension credit take up campaign across tv radio and online some pension credit claim be make in the week follow the winter fuel payment announcement and the campaign continue this week new work to invite all pensioner newly receive housing benefit to claim pension credit will begin 
 i thank the minister the late figure show that at least pensioner be eligible for pension credit but do not claim it which mean they have now also lose out on the winter fuel payment that they previously would have enjoy do the minister think that mean testing be work 
 it be important that pensioner will receive the winter fuel payment this winter the statistic my hon friend refer to relate to previous year before the recent take up campaign however he be right to highlight that under the conservative government in eligible pensioner be miss out 
 in recent day and week household bill across my constituency have go up and up and up many who miss out on pension credit because they be just above the cut off will now be wonder where they will find that extra money will the government think again about the removal of the winter fuel payment and ensure that pension credit be roll out on a taper 
 it be important that we keep drive up the take up of pension credit but that be not the only support available to pensioner everyone will see the state pension rise by over this april the household support fund be very important and will be extend for another year and the warm home discount be available to the poor pensioner 
 government figure show that an additional household have claim pension credit yet that be only about of all those eligible who be not claim it as constituency mp we be have to support people who be really struggle with the cold and their financial balance will the minister think about set up a pensioner poverty taskforce so we can really get underneath the issue face old people 
 i be sure that all member on both side of the house be provide support to their constituent pensioner those of work age and child to ensure they can cope follow a difficult few year for everyone because of the cost of living crisis on pensioner poverty specifically it be important that we update our understanding of how that have develop if we look at the record we see that pensioner poverty halve under the previous labour government but rise by under the tory government over the past year 
 those on the guarantee element of pension credit receive the warm home discount but many do not follow the change make a couple of year ago link the warm home discount to the age and size of a property have the government make any assessment of how many people have be affect the double whammy of lose the warm home discount and the winter fuel payment 
 i have hear the hon gentleman ’s comment and will raise it with the responsible minister in the department for energy security and net but it be important that all pensioner who be entitle to support get it that be what the government be focus on 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of recent trend in the unemployment rate 
 thank to the dreadful inheritance leave to we by the tory government we need to raise productivity reduce economic inactivity increase employment rate and drive up economic growth our get britain working plan set out how we will progress our ambition of an employment rate which would place the uk among the highest perform country in the world 
 there be some lovely wording in that answer but the government appear to be do absolutely the opposite follow the budget it appear that there be not a week that go by without another employer announce significant job cut reed recruitment have already announce that job posting be plummet what will the government do to support the minister ’s department in the situation it will find itself in a rapidly increase number of people look for job and a rapidly decrease number of job be post because of the government ’s policy 
 i be glad the hon gentleman be bother by the employment rate and i hope he be bother by the record of his party which see employment fall off a cliff after the pandemic and never recover we be an outlier in that it do not happen anywhere else in the world as it be our jobcentre which as we have say be full of brilliant staff see just in employer ever consider use they to recruit we will change that we have a new strategy the secretary of state recently announce our plan to ensure that the department of work and pensions serve business and that we get the good job into jobcentre so that people can take they up improve their life and grow our economy 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle benefit fraud by criminal gang 
 i would like to take this opportunity to welcome the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for swansea west torsten bell to his post as pensions minister and to place on record my personal thank to his predecessor my hon friend   the member for wycombe emma reynolds for all her hard work 
 our new public authorities fraud error and recovery bill will update the department ’s power to tackle fraud for the time in more than year include enable our serious and organised crime investigator to apply for a warrant enter and search premise for evidence seize item such as computer and phone and bring criminal gang to justice 
 do my right hon friend agree that tackle fraud against the taxpayer be key to set the country ’s finance on a sustainable footing and allow the investment in public service that my constituent be so desperate to see 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend we have a responsibility and a duty to use every possible measure to ensure that taxpayer money be wisely spend on our school hospital and police and on support   those who be in genuine need our new public authorities fraud error and recovery bill along with fraud measure in the budget will save £ over the next year that be the big fraud package ever we be elect on a mandate for change and that be what this government will deliver 
 in the press today there be a reference to a criminal gang who defraud the dwp by more than £ and be able to abscond to a certain eastern european country without mention too many thing that be happen can the secretary of state tell i whether there be a way within the law of this land of chase those people up get they back here and find out where all that misappropriate money have get to 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise this despicable case the new power in the bill the exist power have not be update for year will bring we into line with other public body and ensure that we can investigate this properly secure the evidence and get our money back 
 what step she be take to support vulnerable people into work 
 we be fully commit to help vulnerable people into work it be good for they it provide firm with great worker it reduce the benefit bill and it boost economic growth connect to work which will be roll out this year will greatly improve support 
 of my constituent be a highly educate high earn civil servant who have serious care need as a result of a bad accident about year ago his need have be assess as health relate which mean that the nhs pay the £ cost of his care if they be reassess as social care need he would be force to exhaust his saving each year his disability be reassess and during that reassessment his ability to work be unfairly treat with suspicion the government say that they want to help disabled people into work which be a good thing my constituent be work already but fear that a huge disincentive will appear on the horizon if his status change do ministers understand his concern 
 yes i definitely do understand his concern our view be that disabled people should have the same chance to work the same opportunity that everyone else take for grant and we want to work with disabled people to reform the system to ensure that that be what they get in the spring we will publish a green paper on reform to the health condition and disability benefit system 
 my constituency face high level of economic vulnerability of my constituent be not in education employment or training and bad in be either neet or   unaccounted for what action be the minister take to ensure that they be help into both employment and skill development 
 i think my hon friend will greatly welcome the youth guarantee announce in the get britain working white paper we want to ensure that every single young person get the same chance we have see a dreadful increase in the number of neet young people over the past few year and we be get to grip with that and tackle it 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the pensions regulator on economic growth 
 the government be look across the piece at how the important work of our regulator support economic growth and the pensions regulator which oversee the large pension system in the world be no exception to that 
 the then pension minister guy opperman say that green lighting define benefit pension superfund be his great achievement of lockdown the unelected governor of the bank of england then unhelpfully intervene and say that superfund would be a risk to financial stability and as a result the pensions regulator have authorise only pension superfund to come into existence can the minister be a little more specific and tell we what exactly he be go to get the pensions regulator to do differently in order to support the growth mission 
 that be an important question the pensions regulator do recognise its important role in support growth indeed it have statutory duty not just to protect saver but to minimise the impact on the growth of employer superfund have an important role to play in ensure that we have large pension fund that be able to invest in a wide range of asset as the hon gentleman say on an interim basis the pensions regulator have authorise such fund but we will take measure in the pension scheme bill to make further progress in this regard 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of mean test the winter fuel payment on level of pensioner poverty 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of mean test the winter fuel payment on level of pensioner poverty 
 this government have run the big ever take up campaign on pension credit which be worth around £ on average to those eligible.[official report   february vol c. 1wc correction it also open the door to extra support and mean that pensioner will continue to receive the winter   fuel payment the modelled impact of the decision to target the winter fuel payment at those who need it most do not account for the measure that this government be take to raise pension credit take up 
 there be no doubt that the cut to the winter fuel payment have hit suffolk hard nhs suffolk report that of bed be occupy over the christmas period due to a spike in cold flu and pneumonia like symptom kesgrave community centre have set up warm room for impact pensioner the only good news be that the suffolk community foundation have manage to raise £ to support pensioner across our community who be impact by the cut will the minister join i in pay tribute to the suffolk community foundation for be there for the most vulnerable people in our society when his government be not 
 this government and the important charity that the hon gentleman mention be here for the most vulnerable pensioner that be why we be target the winter fuel payment at those who need it most and why we will uprate all the state pension element by over this april he raise the case of the national health service and how important it be to old generation but it be his party that drive the nhs into the ground over the last year 
 labour control bridgwater town council be increase its council tax precept by that mean that pensioner in my constituency be suffer from not only the loss of their winter fuel allowance but an enormous tax rise what advice do the minister have for those of my constituent who do not qualify for pension credit and who now face the loss of the winter fuel allowance from this government and a huge tax rise from their labour council 
 i encourage all pensioner to consider whether they be eligible for pension credit but also to look for the wide support that can be provide via the household support fund and the warm home discount i say gently to the hon member that the driving up of council tax bill be a direct result of the destruction of local government finance by the conservative party over year 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i welcome the minister to his place i have a simple question for he how many people be still wait for their winter fuel payment 
 the large campaign to drive up pension credit take up be now under way and it will continue in the year ahead what we be see at present be that anyone who make their claim for pension credit before   december   will receive their winter fuel payment when that claim be process 
 so the answer be that the minister do not know he do not know how many people be wait for their winter fuel payment he do not know how many people be stick in the pension credit backlog he do not know when they will hear about   their claim he do not know who have have help from their local council he do not know how many people who lose their winter fuel payment have end up in hospital this winter he and his department have dodge or refuse to answer every single of those question in recent week will he commit to a full review of the winter fuel payment cut so that we can get those answer 
 i will commit to fight every day to avoid a repeat of the exercise under the last government whereby pensioner poverty rise by have fall by under the last labour government we will make sure that we publish detail of the take up of pension credit by the end of february 
 what step she be take to support people with disability and long term health condition into work 
 what step she be take to support people with disability and long term health condition into work 
 what step she be take to support people with disability and long term health condition into work 
 we will champion disabled people and those with long term health condition   our get britain working plan will support many more who be fail by the last government to enter and stay in work we will devolve power to local area for a join up work health and skill offer 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests prior to my election i represent disabled member on the national executive of unison there be many barrier that prevent disabled people and those with long term health condition from not only enter but stay in the workplace from a strict and punitive approach to attendance and sickness to a failure even to consider adaptation that make work possible it be clear that employer have to be support to make high quality work accessible to disabled people what work be my right hon friend therefore do to engage employer in make work a positive and constructive experience for disabled people 
 i commend my hon friend for her previous work she raise a very important point we have launch the keep britain working review which be be lead by sir charlie mayfield the ex chair of the john lewis partnership it will look at exactly the point that my hon friend raise how to make workplace and the wide labour market more inclusive because we know and employer know that that be good for business and good for disabled people 
 as we all know the last government be far too quick to write off people who want to work but who have health condition or be suffer with disability many people in halesowen tell i that they   want to work and with the right help and support they can this will also bring huge physical and mental health benefit how will the government reset our relationship with people with disability who for far too long have not be give the support that they need but have instead be demonise by the conservative party 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the manifesto on which he and i fight the election commit we to put the view and voice of disabled people at the heart of what we do in the get britain working white paper we announce the establishment of a disability employment panel to enable we to work with disabled people ensure that we provide the necessary support and give they the chance that my hon friend rightly call for 
 in my close friend and constituent jim be at his desk work as a web developer when out of the blue he feel a sudden pain jim be have a spinal stroke he have never since be able to walk the pain medication that jim must take to manage his condition limit his ability to work but sometimes he have unpredictable burst of productivity however jim ’s benefit arrangement mean that the work that he could occasionally be able to do might result in sanction to his benefit what step will the minister take to ensure that jim can get back into work 
 my hon friend ’s important point which to some extent have already be raise show how the health and disability benefit system need to be reform disabled people should have the same right to work and the same opportunity and chance as everybody else many disabled people like jim want the chance to work but they face barrier include in the benefit system that make it very difficult for they to do so we be determined to change the system to get over those barrier 
 i be sure that the minister appreciate the important role of learn disability nurse in maximise the potential of people with learn disability will he therefore have a word with his treasury colleague about the differential effect of the rise in national insurance contribution learn disability nurse who work directly for the nhs be exempt those who work for agency contract by the nhs be not exempt that be an anomaly and i would be grateful if the minister consider talk to his colleague about it 
 i be sure that the right hon member will raise that concern with the appropriate colleague of mine he be absolutely right to draw attention to the value of the work of learn disability nurse whoever their employer be we be determined that they should have well support to enable people with learn disability who want to work to do so 
 the experience of my constituent julie from heaviley highlight the unfairness of the employment and support allowance application process for those with progressive condition such as multiple sclerosis she be assess by a physiotherapist who lack any expertise in neurological disorder she thereby receive inaccurate report that deny her vital   financial support what step be minister take to ensure fair and timely support for those with progressive condition that do not necessarily fit neatly into a box as other disability or condition may 
 we want to improve the assessment process and there will be proposal in the green paper on how to do that if the hon lady would like to drop i a line about this particular case i will be happy to have a look and comment far 
 for year my constituent timothy have attend eastbourne ’s linden court day centre for people with learn disability timothy ’s mum who be his sole carer have speak about how damaging it would be if conservative run east sussex county council decide later this month to close the centre will the minister join i in urge the county council to ditch this short sighted cut which would leave many eastbournians and their family without the local provision they deserve 
 i very much hope that people in eastbourne will continue to get the support that by the sound of it have do a very good job for a very long time i obviously do not know the detail of this case but it be important that we not only maintain but improve support for disabled people 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 i welcome the keep britain working review but accord to last year ’s dwp account £ of benefit be underpaid to claimant and the claimant most affect be disabled people what will the government do to ensure that disabled people who may not be able to work get the money to which they be entitle 
 it be very important that disabled people get the money to which they be entitle there will always be people who be not work and we need to make sure there be good support for they as i say a moment ago we will set out our proposal on improve the assessment process in the upcoming green paper but we be also very interested in hear about the select committee ’s proposal 
 people live with disability in rural area such as glastonbury and somerton face many barrier to find work include lack of opportunity poor transport and high childcare cost how will the minister support individual live in rural area to overcome the barrier to employment and help they to improve their overall quality of life 
 we will be do a lot to support disabled people into work and to remove the barrier that be too often in their way as the hon lady rightly say i have already refer to the disability employment panel we be set up we want to work alongside disabled people to make sure that we get this right and remove the barrier the connect to work programme which be be roll out over this year will do a lot to help however if there be particular problem in the hon lady ’s area that she would like to draw to my attention i will be very interested to hear about they 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the medium report that people in no be tear their hair out in frustration at the dwp take so long to come up with welfare reform we have already be wait month and now we be tell it will be march before there be a green paper and presumably there will be no actual legislation until the end of the year at the early they will be totally bald in no by then give the constant rise in the welfare bill what be the financial cost so far of labour ’s inactivity 
 the inactivity bequeath to we by the previous government have a huge cost the shadow minister may not have notice that the week before last a judicial review be lose on the previous government ’s handling of the work capability assessment change the judge find that the consultation be frankly dishonest it do not tell people what the change entail and be too rush people do not have a chance to give their view 
 we will do this exercise properly this spring in the green paper we will set out the full detail of what we propose and there will be a very full consultation so that everyone have a chance to have their say 
 the answer to my question be £ that be the cost of labour ’s economic inactivity and its failure to reform welfare since the election the sum be the same as the saving from cut the winter fuel payment plus the income from tax family farm in opposition labour oppose impose condition on people claim incapacity benefit do the minister still rule that out or will the green paper face reality and require people to take action where they can to address the health need that mean they be sign off work 
 the green paper will face reality square on it will set out a very full set of clear policy it will be frank about what they entail and we will listen to people ’s view in response the money that the hon gentleman refer to as have be forgo will probably have be forgo as a result of the judicial review the week before last which be because of the previous government ’s failure in consultation 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of level of maternity and paternity pay 
 the government keep the rate of benefit state pension and statutory pay under regular review my hon friend will be aware that the secretary of state for work and pensions announce to parliament on   october   that subject to parliamentary approval parental pay will increase in line with the consumer price index at the rate of from april 
 the government ’s upcoming review of parental leave entitlement be really important as the uk currently have among the bad paternity leave in europe recent research by the joseph rowntree foundation highlight not just the growth benefit of   great paternity leave entitlement but the benefit to workforce involvement so will the minister meet i and campaigner from the dad shift to ensure we be make the most of the opportunity to get people back into work 
 we value the vital role that father and partner play in care for child and in support their partner we recognise that parental leave and pay entitlement such as pay paternity leave play a key role in their ability to do that my hon friend be right to cite the plan parental leave review that be be lead by colleague in the department for business and trade and i will write to they on his behalf to suggest a meeting 
 what step her department plan to take with employer to help increase economic growth 
 what step her department plan to take with employer to help increase economic growth 
 what step her department plan to take with employer to help increase economic growth 
 to get britain grow again we have to get britain work again and support employer be critical to achieve that goal that be why last week i announce an overhaul of how the dwp help business include the introduction of a dedicated employer team in the dwp ensure that there be single account manager for business so they do not have to have multiple conversation with different jobcentre and the expansion of the number of training programme tailor to employer individual need we be work in partnership with business that be how we all go for growth 
 the last labour government reduce child poverty by nearly half from to and legislate to eradicate child poverty by instead under the conservatives the number of child in relative poverty significantly increase between and do the secretary of state agree that work with employer to help people particularly parent into decent well pay job be essential not only to grow our economy but to reduce poverty include child poverty 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend that have more parent include lone parent and earner in couple in well pay job be critical to tackle child poverty there have be a big shift in the nature of poverty since our success during the last labour government when we lift over child out of poverty as there be now more child grow up in poverty in a work household so improve the parental employment rate be critical to drive down those number 
 tu mundo or your world be a grow independent business that recently open its coffee shop in rhyl tu mundo have a distinctive style not just with the toucan motif that grace everything include its teapot but with its commitment to economic growth   in the local area in partnership with the local employability service working denbighshire tu mundo host work start placement for those enter or re enter the workplace with several graduate go on to become permanent employee will the secretary of state join i in congratulate tu mundo and working denbighshire on that work do she agree that that be exactly the sort of partnership work that will bring fair economic growth across the uk 
 yes i would like to say a massive thank to tu mundo for all the work it be do there be a lot of evidence that work placement or work experience be a really important way to encourage more people into work last week i visit b&m the fast grow retailer in the country to look at what it be do with short work experience placement which be a form of try before you buy for the company and the employee the placement have a huge success rate and b&m now recruit of its worker through the scheme we want to continue such success in the future 
 apprenticeship training and reskille in new energy technology will be essential to deliver growth in the hard work humber region can the secretary of state tell we more about the training programme that she mention which will support business in expand opportunity in grimsby and cleethorpes 
 i know that my hon friend be passionate about help more people into work youth unemployment in her constituency be almost twice the national average so it be essential for her constituent that we sort this out alongside work experience we want to expand the number of sector base work programme which have tailor course for employer we will also hold summit in key growth area construction health and social care and clean energy to bring employer together with local area so that we can really go for growth 
 the ambition of the secretary of state for an employment level be bind to be make more difficult by the finding in the impact assessment of the employment rights bill which foresee a £ increase in cost and a increase in strike action be it not 
 government members be ambitious for people right across the country we do not accept the situation that we inherit from the conservative party as the only country in the g7 whose employment rate have not go back to pre pandemic level create more good job in every part of the country and narrow the employment gap between different area be tough but we believe that it be achievable and it be no less than the british people deserve 
 on economic growth what do the secretary of state say to business in my constituency that fully support fair pay and national insurance contribution for employee but whose ability to grow create employment and invest be be impact by the cumulative effect of the change 
 i say that in order to put the public finance on a secure footing we have to take difficult decision i understand the pressure that business be   under but they know that if we do not balance the book we can not grow in future we be take action not just to put the public finance on a secure footing but to have a genuine programme to get britain work again we do not accept the situation that we inherit from the conservatives in which so many people be lock out deny the right to work and deny a good well pay job in every part of the country 
 what step she be take to increase efficiency in the child maintenance service 
 the cms modernisation programme deliver increasingly effective and efficient service the programme have transform customer interaction with the cms provide customer the choice to make contact digitally those efficiency make it easy for customer to report change and non payment so cms caseworker can focus on the collection of unpaid child maintenance 
 i have multiple casework example from constituent in huntingdon who have be impact by cms inefficiency include incorrectly calculate arrear with no explanation of how the sum have be calculate and failure to verify the location of father who be not provide financial support with the cms claim that address need to be independently verify but not conduct that verification itself such case have result in consolatory payment from the cms for maladministration and service delay in all instance my constituent have be frustrate by their inability to contact the cms over the phone in the quarter end september of call to the child maintenance service be not answer what be the government do to improve contact with the cms by telephone 
 i be very sorry to hear of those specific example i will take away the point about telephone communication and come back to the hon gentleman but it may be worth our have a broad conversation about his concern i will happily meet he to discuss any of the specific of the case he cite 
 in response to a number inquiry that i have have from constituent over the last couple of month will the minister say whether reform to the child maintenance service will include consideration of the pay parent ’s capital asset and voluntary pension payment when calculate the rate at which unpaid payment should be make 
 my hon friend raise an important point he will be aware of the recent consultation on the future administration and operation of the child maintenance service i do not want to prejudge the decision that will follow as a result of that consultation but i can tell he that we be consider the next step at present and i will update he and the house in due course 
 what progress her department have make on develop a child poverty strategy 
 it be a terrible consequence of year of conservative misrule that around of our child be grow up in poverty that be why the child poverty taskforce ’s work to complete our strategy be urgent taskforce ministers have meet time and have have extensive engagement with people across the country include external expert local leader and child and their family live in poverty 
 accord to the end child poverty coalition in the child poverty rate after housing cost in my constituency of eastleigh be analysis by the joseph rowntree foundation project that child poverty in england will rise to by every day without action push more child into hardship and they can not wait for the government ’s strategy to be publish what urgent measure will the government take now to prevent more child from grow up in poverty 
 the hon lady be absolutely right this issue be urgent that be why in the budget the chancellor announce the fair repayment rate which stop family have to deal with so much debt through the universal credit system save family over £ a year but we know we have to go far that be why as i mention ministers be work hard to bring forward our child poverty strategy 
 i know the government be work hard on develop their child poverty strategy but what discussion be the minister have with the welsh government to ensure that combine effort deliver the good for our child wherever they live 
 i regularly meet representative of the welsh government because while we strongly believe in devolution we know that a partnership between governments be the good way to protect our child from the terrible consequence of the poverty that the conservatives leave they in 
 i be pleased that the minister be update we with progress do she believe the poverty strategy will be announce quickly enough for there to be change make in for example the spring or autumn statement or be we look into next year please could she give an idea of the timeline 
 i hope the hon lady will understand from the tone of what i say that this matter be urgent and that we be work quickly and will bring forward proposal as soon as we can 
 alarmingly there have be talk of ruthless cut to welfare that would be utterly devastating as any cut would push more family into poverty we will not see a reduction to child poverty by economic growth alone it will require targeted policy action something that the   trussell trust and the joseph rowntree foundation agree with in their essential guarantee do ministers have plan to change the basic rate of universal credit so that it reflect the cost of life ’s essential food and household bill 
 as i have say several time we be work quickly to bring forward the detail of that plan in fact only last week we have a parliamentary engagement session so that colleague across the house could be bring up to speed on the detail of that work i sit on the opposition benches and watch for year as the conservatives put our child into poverty we will waste no time in deal with this problem 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 child in poverty in torbay make up of our population but of our future barnardo ’s recently highlight that the most powerful tool in the government ’s toolbox to tackle child poverty be end the child cap only last week the annual poverty report by the joseph rowntree foundation come to the same conclusion when will the minister come to that same conclusion and end the child cap 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for come along to our parliamentary engagement session last week which i hope he agree be a productive update for everybody as i just mention i watch from the opposition benches as various policy include the he mention be introduce we can see their consequence all around we we can not promise to do anything that we can not pay for but we be determined to have a child poverty strategy that work 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as the minister for employment my hon friend   the member for birkenhead alison mcgovern like to say the department for work and pensions be the hr department of the government ’s growth mission yet we inherit a situation in which only in employer have ever use a jobcentre to recruit that be not good enough which be why i announce last week step to put it right by overhaul what we do for employer that include a new dedicated employer team that have already bring more than company on board include swissport home bargains and kfc soon we will host summit with business in key growth sector such as construction and clean energy as part of our plan to get britain work and grow again 
 cornwall and the isles of scilly be of workwell pilot region which be a core element of the government ’s back to work plan to reduce economic inactivity due to ill health i invite the secretary of state to visit cornwall to see how workwell be already make a tangible difference in help those with health condition to start stay and succeed in   work and to confirm that the spending review will provide the multi year funding necessary to sustain and expand that vital service 
 i would love to visit that be an important programme focus on keep people in work and get those who have recently leave back into work as soon as possible in my hon friend ’s area workwell provide advice on workplace adjustment access to physiotherapy and employment advice and counselling and be work closely with the voluntary sector and employer back by £ worth of funding that be critical because with more than economically inactive people in his constituency we must start turn that situation around 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last week the right hon lady describe herself as the hr manager for the government ’s growth plan so can liz from hr tell i which of her colleague should be fire for the addition of people to the unemployment figure in december 
 i be proud to say that i want to get britain work again after we inherit a situation in which a record people be out of work due to health problem because the conservatives push the nhs to its knee and fail to have a proper plan to get people back into work our mission be to get britain work and grow again and that be what our plan will deliver 
 wishful thinking be all very well but let we talk about the fact those people probably spend christmas worry about how they would pay the bill without a job and they be now look for work in an employment market decimate by labour ’s job tax how high do the right hon lady forecast unemployment will get under her government 
 the hon lady want to talk about the fact the fact be that we inherit a situation in which we will be spend £ more on working age incapacity and disability benefit because of the mess her government make and in which there have be a doubling of the number of young people out of work due to health condition so people be more likely to be out of work due to poor health in their 20 than in their 40 our radical reform will give people the right to work and the support they need and will get the benefit bill on a sustainable footing 
 last month i bring together local leader from charity and other organisation to discuss how we can well tackle child poverty in bracknell forest i welcome today ’s update on the progress of the child poverty taskforce do the minister agree that community leader be well place to shape the support need to tackle child poverty locally 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and i be so pleased to hear about that work in bracknell forest that be why the part of our child poverty strategy   be about local support i look forward to work with my hon friend and his constituent to ensure that strategy be a success 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i be pleased to hear that labour councillor on hull city council have vote to condemn the government ’s shameful decision not to compensate waspi woman have that give the minister pause for thought 
 i recognise the strength of feeling on this issue right across the house we carefully consider the ombudsman ’s report but as the hon member know we do not think it be fair to provide compensation cost up to £ when of affected pensioner know that the state pension age be rise and the evidence show that letter be send early would have make little difference 
 this week mark time to talk day the mind campaign to destigmatise talk about mental health in light of this will the secretary of state join i in call for employer up and down the country to take part in time to talk day and outline what more could be do to end mental health stigma in the workplace 
 i absolutely will as my hon friend know the government have launch the keep britain working review lead by charlie mayfield the former chair of john lewis partnership he be do precisely that look at how we can well support employer to help keep people in work and get they back to work mental health be a real concern for i with so many young people not in education employment or training primarily drive by mental health problem this be an issue we have get to sort because it be terrible for they and for their future and terrible for the economy too 
 i call alison bennett 
 thank you mr speaker 
 we ’re save the government million 
 those be the word of stephanie from burgess hill a full time carer for her year old mum with carer ’s allowance not even cover stephanie ’s petrol cost what assessment have be make of the adequacy of carer ’s allowance in meet the true cost of care 
 the hon member will know that we introduce the big ever increase in the earning threshold for carer ’s allowance for those who be able to combine some work with care we be determined that carer should get the support they need there be a premium in universal credit as well for example but of course we will keep all these matter under review 
 as we have hear today the government have recently launch their keep britain working review development in treatment for incurable cancer such as the i have   mean that many of we with incurable cancer might live and live reasonably well for many year how do the government plan to engage with people with incurable cancer as part of that review to ensure we be enable to continue to thrive in our career and our workplace 
 i commend the resilience of my hon friend before christmas i speak at a report launch with the charity work with cancer which focus on exactly the issue she have raise she be right employer have a key role in support people with cancer to continue to thrive in work and the keep britain working review will engage with people with live experience as well as employer 
 it be now year since the scotland act transfer a swathe of welfare power to the scottish government be ministers in a position to give a finite date by which the scottish government will actually have take on all those power and responsibility that be still not the case 
 as the right hon gentleman rightly say a number of benefit be currently deliver under agency agreement it be very much for the scottish government to broker a conversation with we about either extend those agreement or bring they to an early conclusion i be yet to have any such conversation but should i have any i will be very happy to let he know 
 many people with mental health condition rely heavily on personal independence payment so that they can continue in work and remain active in their community can the minister provide advice to the many constituent of mine who have contact i terrify by the rumour that the government be about to scrap this vital support for those who already have mental health issue 
 my hon friend be right that there have be a particularly big increase in mental health problem among young people give what the last government do i can well understand people be worried we will continue to support people with mental health problem in the health and disability benefit system the proposal for reform we will bring forward in the spring will make sure the system be fit for purpose and fair to the taxpayer and they will deliver the support in work that people such as my hon friend ’s constituent need 
 the child poverty action group have report that child in the uk be live in poverty in a classroom of that be child live in poverty give that the government have rule out scrap the child benefit cap will the minister commit to publish measurable target for reduce child poverty during this parliament 
 as i have already mention in a number of response we understand the scale and seriousness of the problem the hon member mention we have already publish the term of reference for   the child poverty taskforce and we will continue to keep the house update as we move forward give the seriousness of the issue 
 on friday last week we hold our neet those not in education employment or training and youth opportunity summit in peterborough bring together peterborough college anglia ruskin university peterborough and employer to see how we can tackle our youth unemployment problem will the secretary of state commit to work far with place such as peterborough to ensure we can deliver decent apprenticeship and more opportunity for young people who need they 
 yes i do commit to that and i thank my hon friend for his tireless campaign on the issue with almost young people unemployed in his constituency or almost in i know what an important issue it be his area be part of of our youth guarantee trailblazer mean that every young person be earn or learn i commit that the whole government will continue to work with he and partner in his constituency to make sure that no young person be leave behind 
 jamie from my constituency be a full time carer but he be also in full time education and be therefore not entitle to carer ’s allowance will the government confirm that they will extend carer ’s allowance to those in full time education 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point i recently meet a very impressive group of young people who have manage to navigate their way through education while also have very heavy caring responsibility we be work closely with the department for education the department of health and social care the carers trust and the learning and work institute to make sure that we be provide the support young carer need 
 my constituent darren an unpaid carer be wrongly refuse a refund for prescription charge when move from income support to universal credit do my right hon friend agree with i that there should be no gap in support in such circumstance 
 yes i do agree with my hon friend and i be grateful to he for highlight that case we have ask the department for health and social care to review its decision in that case i hope with a positive outcome 
 the minister will have hear several reference to the joseph rowntree foundation report this afternoon the report demonstrate not only that extreme poverty be rise but that the only part of these island where child poverty will fall in the next year be scotland be it not time that the westminster government take a leaf out of the scottish government ’s book 
 i think it be fair to say that we have spend a great deal of time talk to people from all part of the united kingdom and we will continue to do so because only a strategy that cover all of the uk will be a success 
 what assessment have the minister make of recent trend in the level of fraud in the welfare system because every £ lose to fraud be £ that should have go to our school to our hospital or on the future of our resident 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the assessment i have make be of a trend that be up up up after year of the conservative party fail to act we lose £ in fraud and error in the department for work and pensions last year and we have lose £ since the pandemic that be too much which be why i hope colleague will support the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill on reading later 
 hundred of farmer and other small business owner in westmorland who earn less than the minimum wage be not eligible for universal credit because of the failure of that system to take account of variability of income will the minister look to put that right so that we can support the people who support we 
 we be commit in our manifesto to a review of universal credit and i expect to set out shortly the detail of how that review will go forward i will be very happy to look at the particular case the hon gentleman raise in the course of the review 
 we all know that the good route out of poverty be through well pay work but for family in my constituency where a of child grow up in poverty low pay and insecure job be a massive barrier what will the department do to help more family back into work and to alleviate poverty for child grow up in southampton itchen 
 my hon friend eloquently make the case for our make work pay reform this be not just about help our economy grow it be also about protect people from poverty in all we do to change jobcentre we want to support people into good sustainable well pay work because that be the good way out of poverty 
 a constituent come to see i last week who have not eat for day her state pension have increase in line with the triple lock but this take she over the threshold for pension credit which then take away her entitlement to a range of other benefit include the winter fuel allowance what be the government do to ensure people do not experience such a significant cliff edge 
 i thank the hon member for raise that case and i would be happy to meet she to go into a bit more detail that be exactly why we make sure the pension credit threshold rise in line with the basic state pension through the triple lock 
 during covid assessment for personal independence payment be move either online or to over the phone today less than of those assessment have return to face to face so what assessment have ministers make of that change and be there any link with the rise in fraud 
 my hon friend be right to identify that in the pip space the department have introduce a blend of phone video and face to face assessment with the aim of deliver a more efficient and user centre service since telephone and video assessment have be introduce there have be no evidence to suggest that these delivery channel be less effective than face to face assessment in detect fraudulent claim in pip overpayment account for just of the dwp ’s overall spend on pip but i assure my hon friend we will keep a close eye on that 
 marie curie research have find that of the quarter of a end of life carer be live below the poverty line rise to a year after bereavement give these statistic will the minister consider extend the time that carer can claim carer ’s allowance from month to month after bereavement 
 we keep these matter under review i have not look at that particular proposal before but if the hon gentleman would like to drop i a line i will certainly give it a careful look 
 final question dame meg hillier 
 i applaud the front bench team for its energy in drive the child poverty taskforce but every decision have consequence and cost will the minister outline the cost of some of the process she be look at change particularly the cost of lift the child cap and if she do not have the figure to hand will she write to i 
 i thank my hon friend the chair of the treasury committee for all her work on this issue i will happily engage with she through correspondence on the matter 
 urgent question):to ask the secretary of state for science innovation and technology if he will make a statement on astrazeneca 
 as the large company list on the london stock exchange employ more than people and invest about £ every year in the uk astrazeneca be a close and value partner to this government and be critical to the uk ’s thrive life science sector we see that in the covid-19 pandemic when astrazeneca partner with the university of oxford to create a safe and effective vaccine that be manufacture and distribute around the world save million of life 
 this type of partnership for the prevention of illness be critical to achieve the government ’s ambition of reduce the burden on the nhs astrazeneca ’s decision not to invest in speke liverpool be therefore deeply disappointing and follow intensive work and collaboration between the government and the company this collaboration on speke date back to and lead to an announcement at the spring budget when astrazeneca set out its intention to invest £ into its flu vaccine manufacturing facility to secure that investment the previous chancellor provide assurance of his majesty ’s government support value at around £ subject to successful completion of due diligence that support be base on his majesty ’s government ’s initial assessment of figure provide by the company 
 both the previous government and this government have always make clear that full due diligence would be require before a final government offer could be confirm since the spring budget astrazeneca confirm a significant change in the composition of its propose investment result in a small level of research and development be conduct in the uk as the shadow minister would expect that change in astrazeneca ’s uk investment result in a corresponding change in government support 
 our revised government offer seek to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and follow due diligence of the investment put forward by astrazeneca we remain closely engage with astrazeneca as we develop our new industrial strategy build a health system fit for the future and drive up economic growth in the spring the government will release our industrial strategy contain a comprehensive plan for grow the life science sector that will build on the significant momentum generate by the plan for growth include delivery of the oxford cambridge growth corridor as well as the budget announcement of the life science innovative manufacturing fund the suite of inward investment announce at the international investment summit and the strategic partnership announce with oxford nanopore and eli lilly 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 just day ago in another speech about growth design to divert attention from the total lack of growth cause by labour ’s high taxis and anti business approach the chancellor specifically praise astrazeneca   she know that the last conservative government have successfully negotiate a deal for britain ’s big public company to invest £ into britain ’s economy 
 under the conservative deal astrazeneca would have expand its flu vaccine factory on merseyside create new job improve the uk ’s pandemic preparedness and send a clear message to the world that britain ’s life science sector be open for business instead labour have cut the funding that we agree and have impose a national insurance job tax that have destroy the business case for expand the factory and the deal be now off will the minister explain why the secretary of state for science innovation and technology fail to stand up to the chancellor when she cut his funding destroy the deal and hand high quality job and investment to our competitor 
 in the past month astrazeneca have commit to invest more than £ in singapore nearly £ in the us and more than £ in canada it could have invest £ in our country too so what be the government do to bring back the job and investment that they have just turn away 
 by last july all that be require be for labour to confirm that it would proceed with our deal astrazeneca write to the chancellor and the science secretary on   july but receive no reply it write to the secretary of state for business and trade in early july too but he fob it off the company do not receive its answer until last october by then it be too late to deliver the project and now the deal be dead will the minister and the science secretary write to the chair of the science innovation and technology committee   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah offer to appear before her committee to explain what go wrong and how such failure can be avoid in the future 
 deliver this deal secure by the conservatives be a big test of labour ’s economic credibility and it have fail in the same week that it talk about growth it have botch a deal that be vital to our economy labour promise growth but deliver failure and let britain down again 
 what utter nonsense we endure year of growth that even the shadow minister ’s own back benchers use to describe as anaemic and feeble average growth under tory governments be average growth under labour governments be we be far more likely to secure growth in the british economy under a labour government 
 the shadow minister simply do not listen to what i have to say the conservatives sit on this so call deal with astrazeneca for year the process start in and it be interesting what be announce to the house and what be actually announce in the paperwork in the house the then chancellor say that astrazeneca have announce plan to invest to 
 fund the building of a vaccine manufacture hub in speke in liverpool ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 he do not make any mention in the chamber of the money that be need from his department to be able to pay for it the paperwork that attend that announcement state 
 astrazeneca ’s investment decision be contingent upon mutual agreement with the uk government and party and successful completion of regulatory process 
 that be absolutely typical of the previous government they think that when they have announce something it have come to pass but due diligence be need to ensure the good possible financial advantage for the british taxpayer 
 we have see clearly that astrazeneca ’s original intention last year be to deliver £ worth of r&d but then it decide to cut that to something like £ worth that be its decision base on its own investment decision and we as a government have to assess whether £ from the uk as supposedly promise by the previous chancellor be the right amount of money to put into the pot or whether it be well to offer slightly less unfortunately at the end of that process astrazeneca decide that it would not proceed 
 let i make it absolutely clear to the hon member that this be the good country in the world in which to invest in the private sector some £ of investment be secure at the growth summit last year and £ billion—[interruption 
 order the shadow secretary of state for wales   the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies keep push it a little bit i think we should hear no more of that 
 thank you mr speaker and £ be secure follow the announcement of our artificial intelligence opportunity plan we have cut the rate of corporation tax to which be the low in the g7 we be create a pension mega fund to be able to invest far accord to pricewaterhousecoopers last ceo survey we be for the time ever the good place in the world to invest in the government and that be because we have a labour government not a conservative reject 
 i call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee 
 the uk government be commit to grow the economy through increase r&d and advanced manufacturing astrazeneca tell we that it be commit to invest in the uk which be where it be headquarter and where of its large customer the nhs be base it be like hear that people be madly in love with each other yet the wedding be off i look forward to the minister of state for science explain the background to this to the select committee when he appear before we next week 
 in the meantime will the minister confirm that the uk be commit to incentivise r&d investment will he set out the mix of r&d and manufacturing investment agree to by astrazeneca under the last government and to which it be commit when it drop the deal finally the deal as well as grow the economy would have make our pandemic supply chain more resilient by reduce our dependence on mrna vaccine will he set out how he intend to address that 
 it be good to hear from the chair of the select committee i want to make it absolutely clear that astrazeneca be not leave people be not lose their job because of this decision there be still people employ by astrazeneca in the uk and for   that matter it be proceed with its nasal base flu vaccine for child just in a different way all of that be important 
 my hon friend ask about the precise detail of the r&d mix that be part of the investment as i say it be to have be £ of investment astrazeneca decide to cut that to £ which be why the contribution that the previous chancellor have suggest of £ into that pot simply do not add up for the uk taxpayer which be why we come to that set of decision however she be absolutely right that we be fundamentally committed to the life science sector for the saving of life for make sure that we have an nhs that can really deliver for people and because we want to have valuable job that we do well in this country than anywhere else in the world 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 this news make for yet another disappointing day for the uk ’s investment landscape we could be a global leader in innovation but ever since the previous conservative government ’s scrapping of the industrial strategy business have be leave with uncertainty the life science sector be vital not just for economic growth but for our health and technological innovation it contribute over £ to the uk economy support thousand of highly skilled job and drive breakthrough in medicine and healthcare yet in conversation that i have have with business i have hear time and again how the uk ’s fragmented approach to investment be hold they back that be why i have highlight those concern in previous question to the secretary of state 
 the government have promise to publish invest this spring but right now company still have no detail on what support will be available and when without urgent action we risk more world lead firm follow astrazeneca ’s lead and take their investment elsewhere will the minister please confirm exactly when the final invest strategy will be publish the government say that the decision be base on value for money so will the minister and the secretary of state also publish the impact assessment so that we can see for ourselves 
 i be afraid that i will have to write to the hon lady on that last question as i be not sure precisely where we be with an impact assessment she be absolutely right that the uk ’s life science sector generate something like £ in turnover in the financial year end a sharp increase on the previous year we want to build on that the sector have see year on year growth since the financial year end and turnover be now high than in the financial year end we be keen to publish as part of our industrial strategy our precise plan for the financial service sector we say that will be in the spring it certainly still feel like winter in the rhondda at the weekend so i be afraid she will have to wait until spring have spring 
 astrazeneca be a key partner in the liverpool city region ’s life sciences innovation zone as be maghull health park in my constituency with its research and development plan will my hon friend confirm that the government will engage with partner in the city region include the university of liverpool the metro mayor steve rotheram   council leader and the region ’s mp to try to recover ground on this deal which will add to the success we have already see with astrazeneca in the city region and across the country 
 regional mayor have an important role to play in help bring investment into key area i be happy to ensure that the meeting that my hon friend have ask for take place this have to be a joint venture between everyone i want to underline that it be not the case that astrazeneca be leave the united kingdom or that it do not have confidence in the united kingdom because it clearly do it invest more than £ every year into the uk economy it be a key partner of the uk and will continue to be so 
 what a shame the minister have choose to substitute aggression for what should be regret for what be whichever way he paint it obviously a terrible failure of negotiation i chair the all party parliamentary group for life science and i can tell the house that this be a terrible blow not just for speke and liverpool the city of my birth but for our vaccination development environment generally the lack of this production facility mean that there will be no pull for vaccination development in the uk and the various technology that come with it what will he do to replace that 
 of course we feel regretful we would have prefer to get this over the line but that be not possible in large measure because astrazeneca decide that it do not add up in whatever particular way for it the right hon gentleman make very good point we want a manufacturing provision in the country and my colleague lord vallance be work on that very closely with the sector 
 friday ’s announcement be deeply disappointing the liverpool city region be home to of europe ’s large pharma cluster the government be prepared to put million into the project with astrazeneca which it have now walk away from be that money still on the table for other viable life science project in our region will the government commit to meet our metro mayor steve rotheram to discuss that far 
 that be the clever bid for finance that i have ever hear so my hon friend get an award for that she be right that we stand ready at any point to assist key investment of this nature especially in the life science sector the difference between the amount of money that be theoretically make available by the previous government and the amount that we be prepared to put forward be remarkably small the issue be how to ensure that similar investment get over the line someone from the department will meet steve rotheram 
 how do lose £ of investment on merseyside and into the wide north west area equate with the chancellor ’s state priority of economic growth 
 the right hon lady put it in a particular way but it be not a way that be consonant with the fact the fact be that this deal have not be sign or get over   the line by the previous government who as i have say would quite often announce thing and not actually deliver in the end in spring the then chancellor make it very clear in the document that accompany the budget that all of this be contingent his word not mine on due diligence the then government have not yet do the due diligence 
 more than people be employ at astrazeneca ’s macclesfield campus produce world class medicine and contribute £ in gva and of total uk export astrazeneca have confirm to i that the speke decision do not impact macclesfield a site that it be commit to will the minister confirm that the government be commit to work with az so it continue to have a bright future in macclesfield 
 yes i know that my hon friend have visit astrazeneca and speak to it many time he be absolutely right to note that there be i think work at the macclesfield site and will continue to do so i be sure that astrazeneca have a very strong future in macclesfield nothing in this decision change that iota 
 we in this house often underestimate how many option company such as astrazeneca have on where to invest the minister be not know for take no as an answer so can i urge he to continue to make the case for this investment be flexible on vfm and keep fight for this specific deal 
 not necessarily for this specific deal but certainly for a deal with astrazeneca yes 
 astrazeneca ’s decision to pull its £ investment in the speke manufacture plant be a blow for the creation of job across the city region include in my constituency i commend my right hon friend   the member for liverpool garston maria eagle   for her tireless effort in try to get this deal over the line will the minister join i in recognise the brilliant work of the scientist at the facility and will he meet i and colleague to explain how he can guarantee investment in r&d in the city region go forward 
 i would be delighted to meet my hon friend know as she know although i think it would probably be more useful for she if she be to meet lord vallance who be the minister for life science my hon friend be absolutely right we would of course much prefer this investment to go ahead and to have be able to get this deal over the line however it have not be possible and we now have to look at different way of ensure that we strengthen the relationship with astrazeneca however i would point to other investment that have be make in recent month include in life science to quite significant effect 
 the financial times report that during its negotiation with the government astrazeneca raise concern about the vaccine plant but also about the rejection of of its breast cancer drug and the drug pricing mechanism do the minister agree that astrazeneca ’s rejection of his government ’s final offer be not the only concern   issue for our biopharma industry and will he assure i that he be raise issue around the regulatory and reimbursement process with the health secretary and the treasury as barrier to growth in a sector already struggle with post brexit red tape 
 the hon lady ’s point be on the voluntary scheme for brand medicine pricing and access which be reduce to an acronym that be not really an acronym vpag this be as it say on the tin a voluntary agreement between government the pharmaceutical industry and the nhs which be design specifically to ensure that we protect the nhs ’s medicine budget it be voluntary and astrazeneca have always be a party to it on a voluntary basis i be not sure that be the problem the hon lady think it be although if she have further evidence i would be happy to speak to she 
 i think she be also refer to the rejection by the national institute for health and care excellence of a breast cancer drug this be the time in year that a breast cancer drug have be reject by nice and it be obviously concern for everybody who want to be able to use these drug however we have an independent and much respect system in the uk i stand by that independence i be not go to undermine it 
 may i say in the gentlest possible way to my hon friend the minister that lose investment in merseyside and the north west be not compensate for by investment in the oxford cambridge corridor particularly as some year ago we lose diamond light source from daresbury i would also like to ask he a question on a deep issue beyond the normal party political dance it ’ their fault it ’ not or whatever when kate bingham the heroine of covid and develop vaccine finish she make excoriate comment about our civil servant and their ability to understand science and biological science what be the minister do to improve that situation so that distinguish people like kate bingham do not say that official in the civil service treat this huge industry with suspicion and contempt 
 if i might just refer to the comment i be the member for rhondda and ogmore so i fully understand that investment in part of the country be obviously great for that part of the country but it do not necessarily mean that every part of the country be rise with everybody else try to make sure that economic investment spread across the whole of the united kingdom include in the north west the north east and in the south wales valley be a really important part of our historic mission 
 on my hon friend ’s other point astrazeneca complain about the length of time all of this have take as i say it start in and it be only in that the announcement be make as i understand it by a text message from the then chancellor of the exchequer to the chief executive of astrazeneca we might need to learn well way of inform our decision about science 
 do the government ’s rise in national insurance contribution and the over £ a year extra that astrazeneca would have need to pay for the site contribute to its decision to withdraw 
 no 
 i declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on vulnerable group to pandemic more than clinically vulnerable people be still shield from covid because their mrna vaccine do not provide efficient protection for immunosuppressed people will my hon friend set out how the department be put the uk at the forefront of international r&d in life science to support those very vulnerable people 
 not only have we set aside £ precisely to be able to invest in the life science industry with an innovation fund we be very keen to work with specific business to understand how they can make more secure long term investment the single most important thing for most people make an investment in the uk be whether they believe there be political fiscal and financial stability in the uk that be what we be absolutely determined to deliver my hon friend make a very good point about those who be immunosuppresse for all sort of different reason whether their medication or a condition i will take that point back to the department 
 the chancellor say that economic growth be the most important thing and this be an opportunity to get some of that economic growth this be an opportunity to get something over the line and the uk government fail to deliver it how can the house and the public trust anything the uk government say how can they say that this be the found mission if they then fail to deliver for a region that could really do with that economic growth 
 the thing be that spend taxpayer money have to be prove to be good value for money that be why whenever we be make an investment such as this we have to make sure it deliver more return on investment than £ for £ when astrazeneca make the decision to cut the r&d part of its budget from £ to £ it make sense for the uk government to look again at the amount of money we could legitimately put in on behalf of the taxpayer if the hon lady have be in my place i think she would have make exactly the same decision 
 do the minister agree that the chancellor ’s announcement last week of investment in the oxford cambridge corridor show very clearly that the government see a bright future for life science in the united kingdom and will he forgive i for give a brief plug to a post war new town my constituency of harlow which would very much like to be part of that future 
 there be all sort of bid come in now none of which i be in charge of but we have see significant add investment in the uk since the autumn for instance iberdrola be double its investment through scottish power from £ to £ over the next year and blackstone have confirm a £ investment in blyth in northumberland what be essential however be for we to ensure that that investment stretch across the uk that we have the skill we need in order to deliver those investment and that we have the economic structure in place to enable they to remain   because they be long term investment not just short term one also sometimes we have to tackle the over regulation that exist in some element of the economy particularly in relation to planning so that we can get down to make the decision that the tories should have make for year 
 the chief scientific officer have previously state the importance of this investment in the uk ’s pandemic preparedness in the light of the announcement what assessment have the minister make of the impact on the uk ’s ability to respond to future pandemic 
 it be not entirely dependent on our astrazeneca programme and indeed as i have already point out the piece of work in which it be intend to invest i hope i will get the science right be change the way in which it would create the nasal flu vaccine for child from an egg base to a cell base system it have now decide not to do that but to stick to the egg base system i think that if the chief scientific adviser or the chief medical officer have anything on which to update the house he and/or she will do so.[official report   february vol c. 6wc correction 
 despite astrazeneca ’s decision the uk biotech industry almost double last year to £ but it be concentrate in just a few company will the minister commit to look at some of the trial research rule to enable small company to work well with nhs trust so that start up and local firm can prosper 
 my hon friend be right not only do we need to enable small company to start up but we need to enable they to grow to scale otherwise the danger be that we develop the good idea someone else end up buy the intellectual property and all the value disappear out the uk ’s back door when i meet the husband and wife team who run biontech they be amazing not least in respect of some of the work they have do in develop immunotherapy which be probably the stuff that save my life when i have stage cancer they speak warmly and glowingly about all the work that they want to do in the uk alongside the work of astrazeneca as my hon friend say we need to get small company set up to grow they and to enable they to be world leader like astrazeneca 
 investment in highly pay industry produce good quality research and development and the spin off from that be of course important to the economy and to long term growth i agree with the minister that when it come to use public money we have to be careful about how it be spend and not just throw it at a company because it have threaten to walk away from investment in fact i should have think that those on the opposition front bench would be quite happy to hear the minister talk about the proper use of public finance like a prudent conservative minister my question however be this although due diligence have to be do and it may well have be assess that this be not a good use of public money be the investment lose because of a lack of communication between the government and the company during the assessment process when perhaps the company could have be convince that it could proceed even with less support 
 i will take support from wherever i can get it so i be grateful to the right hon gentleman it be a very simple point that when the government invest in business of whatever kind we have to make sure that we get value for money for the taxpayer even when there be a very large cheque on the table astrazeneca decide to change the structure of its research and development which be of the reason why we have to change the amount of money that we be prepared to put in but the right hon gentleman ’s other point be very good and well make 
 alongside other member represent milton keynes i attend the chancellor ’s speech last wednesday and speak to many company include those from the life science sector there be really important point that they want to make after be reasonably pleased with what they hear from the chancellor the be about the importance of talk up our world lead university after the previous government continually talk they down will the minister commit that this government will continue to sell our world lead university include oxford and cambridge on the world stage 
 the point that company want to make be that invest in life science right across the country require a successful oxford cambridge arc will the minister commit to do whatever it take to make the entire corridor successful include by get a devolution deal for the midland and speak to his colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that that happen 
 yes and i agree with everything my hon friend say the oxford cambridge corridor be really important read the newspaper over the weekend i be intrigue by how many conservative commentator keep on say what i do not understand be why the conservatives do n’t do this over the last year it be not enough simply to build the oxford cambridge corridor we need to make sure that we build on creative and scientific innovation at all our university in the united kingdom and not just at oxford and cambridge 
 we receive terrible news from astrazeneca over the weekend it be business across the country such as those in my constituency of broxbourne that create economic growth not the government the government have increase red tape and employer ’s national insurance contribution can the minister outline how he be promote business and encourage they to invest in the united kingdom 
 as i have already say we have £ of investment at the summit before christmas and we have have £ of investment since christmas i have a specific responsibility for datum in the department for science innovation and technology and the number of datum centre invest in the uk be significant we now have which put we after the united states of america and germany we be determined to grow the economy the hon gentleman be sort of right to say that it be the private sector that create growth but it be also true to say that the government contribute to growth for instance if we manage to build additional home in the uk that will contribute to growth if the conservatives do not believe that they be live in cloud cuckoo land 
 the wide context of the issue before we today be that this country be at the forefront of the global life science sector of which there be cluster across the uk in my constituency of stevenage which be the post war new town in the oxford cambridge corridor we have glaxosmithkline autolus and the cell and gene therapy catapult will my hon friend tell the house how this government be commit to spread growth in the life science sector across the whole country and thank all our hard work scientist 
 that be precisely the job that lord vallance be engage in we be try to make sure that our research and development budget across the whole of the uk be spend in a way that deliver economic growth and investment in company that be start up but also in one that need to scale up we be also work with the department for education to make sure that we have the skill that we need in the uk not just to come up with a good scientific idea but to develop entrepreneurialism and to be able to take an idea to market and make a living out of it
