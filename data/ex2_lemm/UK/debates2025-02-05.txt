 almost every day peak time train be cancel and when the train finally turn up it ’ overcrowded 
 recently she be strand for hour after constant cancellation because train crew be unavailable can the prime minister reassure my constituent that this government be commit to build reliable railway after year of tory chaos

 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 what assessment she have make with cabinet colleague of the accessibility of domestic violence prevention service for woman 
 because this be the opportunity i have have to do so may i offer my heartfelt congratulation to   the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho   on welcome her new son into the world i wish she and her family every happiness in this wonderful phase of their journey together 
 the government be steadfast in their mission to halve violence against woman and girl have run a woman ’s refuge before come to this place i know how important it be for survivor to receive effective timely support and we be invest more in those service 
 in her report the domestic abuse commissioner warn of a patchwork of provision in local service just in victim report be able to access a helpline and only in report be able to obtain refuge accommodation local organisation such as womencentre calderdale and kirklees do fantastic work for my constituent but not all victim and survivor have the right support when they need it will the minister ensure that the upcoming violence against woman and girl strategy include a requirement for the government to engage with the sector so that woman across the country receive consistent care and support 
 let i start by pay tribute to halifax womencentre for its vital work in calder valley i assure my hon friend that we will engage across government draw on expertise in the sector through the development of our new violence against woman and girl strategy which will be publish later this year we have provide an increase of £ for domestic abuse safe accommodation service as well as do wide work to help local commissioner to identify need and commission appropriate service 
 organisation such as voices and the southside project in bath provide a wonderful and important service for victim of abuse but they need the long term certainty of funding do the minister agree that we need to give they that certainty 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for mention the excellent organisation in her constituency and the work that they do to support survivor we be invest more in provision but i understand her point about the need for security of long term funding and we will consider that as part of our vawg strategy 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we welcome the government ’s mission to halve violence against woman and girl but a recent report from the national audit office make grim reading state that in woman be victim of violence every year and that there be more than victim in the year up to june it also suggest while there be a welcome focus on victim we be not do enough in term of prevention how will the minister ensure that this mission will focus on education and prevention in school as well as seek to support every survivor and be she speak to the scottish government about co ordination 
 the hon lady be right to draw attention to the legacy picture paint by the national audit office we be invest in a new national police centre for vawg public protection and ensure that we have a real focus on tackle high risk offender by intervene much early and take further measure involve domestic abuse specialist however as the hon lady say this be also about prevention it be a responsibility for all of we across society man and woman alike and there be an important role for education work be under way in the department for education to ensure that young people from an early point understand healthy relationship and what consent look like of course i be always happy to discuss that with colleague across the uk 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help reduce the gender pay gap 
 woman ’s equality and economic growth go hand in hand because the progress on close the gender pay gap stall under the last government as part of the employment rights bill we be require   large employer to publish gender pay gap action plan alongside their figure to show what they be do to tackle pay disparity 
 i thank the minister for her response do she agree that while the conservatives think that maternity pay have go too far and that the childcare roll out be a mistake it be this uk labour government who be support woman in my livingston constituency and right across the country by bring in well protection for pregnant woman and mum on maternity leave 
 yes this government know that support hard work parent be fundamental for economic growth our enhance dismissal protection for pregnant woman and new mum will make it clear to they that the law be on their side that be the right thing for woman and it be the right thing for our economy 
 i thank the minister for her answer she be always positive and reassure we back benchers what discussion have take place with the department for education about encourage young woman to consider apprenticeship in mechanic joinery and a host of other trade that be equally well pay they can do those job every bit as well as man but they have be historically under represent 
 i be very grateful to the hon gentleman for his kind word and for his passion about apprenticeship which we on this side of the house absolutely share i be delighted that next week be national apprenticeship week we be absolutely committed to ensure that more girl see a future for themselves in science technology engineering and mathematic again that will be great for they and great for our economy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on monday a judge in an employment tribunal bring by the gmb union rule that predominantly female asda employee on the shop floor and predominantly male employee work in asda ’s warehouse completely different role with different condition be carry out work of equal value the ruling which be similar to that which bankrupt birmingham city council could cost asda £ in back pay and an annual wage bill increase of £ an even big blow than the additional £ increase in the company ’s wage bill as a result of the chancellor ’s budget do the minister agree that private company should be free to set different wage for completely different job irrespective of the gender balance in those role without be overrule by the court interruption 
 i think the response of the house be very similar to the response of the general public and indeed the response of business business know that have pay that be in line with skill and equal pay for work of equal value be incredibly important clearly matter that have be cover in employment tribunal be for those tribunal to determine and i would not criticise the result of an employment tribunal from within this house if i be the hon gentleman 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for education on send provision 
 this government ’s ambition be that all child with special educational need receive the right support to succeed where possible in mainstream school to far support that vision in december i announce £ of high need capital for the department be work closely with expert on reform and have recently appoint a strategic adviser for send who will play a key role in engage with practitioner child and family as we consider the next step in send reform 
 i draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 hertfordshire currently receive the low send funding in the country despite the number of child in the county with education health and care plan grow by in the last decade what step be the minister take with her cabinet colleague to create a fairer funding system that ensure that all child wherever they live across the country can have the funding they need to support their education 
 i recognise the hon gentleman ’s interest in this area and the interest of member from right across the house in the urgent need to reform the send system however i gently observe that we inherit the funding mechanism from the previous government and that the last conservative education secretary say that the send system they have leave behind be lose lose lose we be determined to fix it to build up parent confidence and to make sure that all child get the education and support that they need 
 i welcome this government ’s commitment to halve violence against woman and girl and their investment in the domestic abuse protection order scheme in croydon however croydon ’s youth engagement team who focus on help to prevent young woman from be bring into gang through grooming abuse and vulnerability be face cut due to the budget constraint face the council what more can the government do to support local community and local council to prevent young woman from be drag into gang through grooming and thing like that 
 my hon friend mention a vital area there be an important role for youth service as part of this but we also need to do much more around safeguarding the provision in the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill on multi agency child protection measure and much more besides and the additional investment that we be put into the system around child ’s social care will make a real difference in tackle the unacceptable exploitation that sadly blight the life of too many child across our country 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to   implement the finding of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report on woman ’s state pension age 
 the government have make and publish their decision we accept the ombudsman ’s finding of maladministration and apologise for the delay in writing to the woman affect we have start work with the ombudsman to make sure that lesson be learn and we will develop a plan for effective and timely state pension communication 
 it be fair to say that people be disillusion with politic and politician because they feel that thing do not change not for the well anyway the tories would not compensate the waspi woman and it look like neither will we the tories here and the scottish national party government in holyrood abandon the worker of the grangemouth refinery and i have to say that so far our government have not fare any well my question be a pointed do the secretary of state and the wide government not realise that if we do not provide the positive change that we promise and improve living standard the next government could be a hard line far right effort that look to impoverish society far 
 i can reassure my hon friend that we have be elect on a manifesto of change and change be we what will deliver we have be work hard on grangemouth on the question of waspi we do not think that compensation be appropriate the evidence be that of those affect do know that a change be come but we can not work out now who do and who do not know among those investigate by the ombudsman nobody lose out financially from not know so we could not justify pay out up to £ in compensation instead we be go to work to make sure that the problem never happen again 
 woman across this united kingdom feel let down by this government and rightly so what will the minister do to reassure those woman he need to put action to his word and support those woman who have be wrong for so many year right across this united kingdom 
 we be go to work with the ombudsman to make sure that this never happen again a detailed report will be publish and we be committed to make sure that in future sufficient notice be give of any state pension change we be also go to develop a communication strategy use the most up to date method for the state pension for example the check your state pension service give a forecast include tell people when they can take their state pension 
 when she expect the equality and human rights commission to publish its revise code of practice for service public function and association 
 this government be steadfast in their commitment to protect single sex space and commit to ensure that service feel confident in provide they with well guidance the ehrc will publish the revised code once it have finalise the draft and it have be approve by ministers that follow the ehrc ’s consultation which have now close 
 the government have recognise that there be confusion or a lack of awareness about the same sex exception in the equality act and how to apply they practice so do the minister agree that the update ehrc statutory code be need as soon as possible to make it explicitly clear that the act provide for single sex service for biological woman 
 it be vital that service provider have clear guidance about the equality act the ehrc have already publish non statutory guidance on the legislation for separate and single sex service provider and the new government have also act to underline that single sex refuge for example be fully legally compliant as i emphasise when i visit such a refuge in september 
 what discussion she have have with the secretary of state for the home department on tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 i be not sure that mr speaker would allow i to go into quite that level of detail on the amount of discussion i have with the home secretary on this issue it would take hour because this happen every single day this weekend the government announce that we will be spend £ to create a national police centre for violence against woman and girl and public protection and that be due to launch in april 
 accord to the national audit office ’s report publish on friday the epidemic of violence against woman and girl be get bad and current prevention activity have largely 
 focus on reduce reoffende rather than avoid initial offence 
 in hampshire and the isle of wight which include my eastleigh constituency domestic abuse incident and crime be record from april to march follow recent tragic event what measure be the minister take to encourage prevention and foster the cultural change necessary to keep woman and girl safe 
 i thank the hon lady and i be sure the entire house agree with the tone with which she speak about domestic abuse in her area the national audit office write what frankly can only be consider to be a damn indictment of the previous government ’s violence against woman and girl strategy we will do everything we can to ensure prevention both through   education and with those who perpetrate which will be a fundamental part of our strategy unlike previous strategy we will actually do it 
 many woman fear violence and assault on night out even more so when alcohol be involve and it be dark in my constituency the tamworth street angel do vital work to ensure that people feel safe in the town centre during the evening and they offer support when woman need it most do the minister agree that we should support such organisation and will she join i in congratulate the tamworth street angel on their recent king ’s award for voluntary service 
 i join my hon friend in say what amazing and vital work be be do by people like the tamworth street angel it be unacceptable that woman feel unsafe when they be out and about and this government seek not only to change legislation on spike for example to make sure our law be right but to make sure that on the ground we be train people in pub club bar and across our night time economy we can write word on goatskin but when the rubber hit the road in place like tamworth we need people like the street angel to make sure it actually mean something 
 i call the shadow minister 
 week ago the government announce local inquiry into rape gang which crucially can not compel witness to give evidence we still do not know where all the inquiry will be and we do not know how the town will be choose 
 as charlie peters from gb news originally report groom gang be suspect to have operate in town do the minister recognise that the failure to announce a meaningful national statutory inquiry mean that woman and girl from across the country who be not from the select town will be deny justice and a fair hearing if the victim want a national statutory inquiry why do n’t the minister 
 i have spend time with the victim that the shadow minister speak about in fact i will be go to see more victim from across the country i speak to these victim every single week week in week out unlike many of those sit on the opposition benches 
 previously absolutely nothing be do to try to get to the truth in some of these town we will do whatever we can to root out this crisis which be what everybody in this house want to see although some member wish to use it for political end we have offer to open up case and we have set the taskforce to do exactly that with any victim who wish to come forward

 the whole house will be aware of the importance of the tyne valley railway line to my constituency and it be essential that our station be accessible to all local campaigner such as active travel tynedale and rosanna lovett have express their frustration at the inaccessibility of station across our constituency will the minister join i in commend their work to make travel truly accessible 
 i join my hon friend in commend that work i know the tyne valley line very well it be in a beautiful part of the country it be important that the rail network be accessible for all passenger and that be at the heart of our approach i will ensure ministers at the department for transport look into the case that he raise and provide more information about the action that be be take for his constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the call for evidence start last year by the leader of the opposition when she be minister for women and equality ask the public to share example of bad guidance on single sex space and service this labour government initially share just response just of the response with the equality and human rights commission which be the body that give advice to institution on equality in the law why do the government rule out of the public response that be a massive betrayal of labour ’s manifesto commitment to protect single sex space the public rightly deserve to have every single of over submission consider properly by the ehrc 
 order these be topical question they need to be short and punchy which this answer will be come on 
 the previous government ’s scope be narrow we be take action to give all provider the assurance that they need that single sex space can be provide i have meet representative from the ehrc to discuss that point and i have write to the ehrc about it i will take no lecture from the conservatives on single sex space when the use of mixed sex hospital ward increase on their watch 
 my living wage intern start next week just as a sutton trust report show that internship be critical entry point to career but that working class graduate be less likely to complete an internship than their wealthy peer and most internship be never advertise what be my right hon friend do to ensure that career success be base on hard work and talent not parent social network 
 i agree with my hon friend that no young person should be hold back by their background or expect to work for free we remain committed to ban unpaid internship so that young people be pay fairly we will set out further detail in due course 
 in norfolk and waveney of woman on the gynaecology waiting list have be wait for treatment for long than the week nhs target and in have be wait over a year they be the bad waiting time statistic in england so will the minister set out what conversation she have have with the secretary of state for health and social care to ensure that woman in north norfolk will no long be leave behind

 working class boy in the north east be be hold back by an attainment gap base on gender and income the previous government have no strategy for deal with such attainment gap what will this government do will the minister commit to a strategy on this issue

 i agree with my hon friend about the importance of the issue she identify i will ensure that the relevant minister pick up on the point and ensure that electoral administrator be aware of their responsibility 
 the government have a long stand position that they do not engage with the muslim council of britain    so why do the minister for social security and disability decide to breach collective responsibility to attend a recent dinner host by the mcb 
 the government ’s position on relation with the mcb have not change 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 it be the beginning of lgbt history month trans people across the uk be struggle to access healthcare and find it difficult to go about their life with dignity as their identity come under constant attack from powerful people across the world progress can not be take for grant will the minister reconfirm the government ’s commitment to the entire lgbtq+ community and outline what step be be take to engage with lgbt people in the uk interruption

 i thank the hon gentleman for steadfastly raise this really important issue particularly during children ’s mental health week i have meet the dads walk they be inspirational and their courage be extraordinary as the father of young child i do not know how they be able to campaign in the way that they do i be not sure i would be able to do so of course i can assure the hon gentleman that i will meet they again and push this really important agenda forward 
 per cent of train at kearsley station in my constituency be delay or cancel in the past week that be widespread through bolton south and walkden my constituent sophie who commute from walkden to manchester tell i that 
 almost every day peak time train be cancel and when the train finally turn up it ’ overcrowded 
 recently she be strand for hour after constant cancellation because train crew be unavailable can the prime minister reassure my constituent that this government be commit to build reliable railway after year of tory chaos 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that the conservative party leave our railway in a terrible state year of strike cost our economy £ in lose revenue you can not grow the economy if you can not run the railway we will launch great british railways to focus relentlessly on passenger and to clamp down on delay and cancellation i be pleased that northern have announce the large ever investment in its fleet to deliver new train mean more comfortable and reliable journey for my hon friend ’s constituent 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 when labour negotiate our country lose yesterday we hear that the government offer £ for mauritius to take our territory in the chagos island this be money that belong to our child and their child this be an immoral surrender so that north london lawyer can boast at their dinner party 
 when labour negotiate we all lose sometimes it do not even bother to negotiate why do the secretary of state for energy security and net withdraw government lawyer from defend the case against the eco nutter who want to obstruct the rosebank oil and gas field 
 let i deal with the serious issue that the leader of the opposition raise in relation to the chagos case this be a military base that be vital to our national security a number of year ago the legal certainty of that base be throw into doubt let i be clear mr speaker and i shall pick my word carefully without legal certainty the base can not operate in practical term as it should that be bad for our national security and a gift to our adversary some within the conservative party know exactly what i be talk about that be why the last government start negotiation about sovereignty and about secure the long term use of the base they be right to do so that be why the last government conduct of the round of those negotiation and they be right to do so that be why this government have complete that process and we be right to do so 
 mr speaker i will set out the detail when they be finalise and they will of course be present to parliament but if the leader of the opposition be properly brief on the national security implication when she be ask these question which she be perfectly entitle to do then she know exactly what i be talk about in term of national security and legal certainty if on the other hand she be not properly brief on the national security implication she be not do her job she be not concerned about national security and she be not fit to be prime minister 
 how can anyone believe that this man be defend uk interest when he bend the knee to anyone who ask he his answer be so weak and so waffly it be no wonder that he need a voice coach but he do not answer the question i ask he why the energy secretary be not defend our country the secretaries of state for energy security and net and for environment food and rural affairs receive nearly £ worth of donation from lisbet rausing it be her money that be behind the court case that will stop an £ investment threaten thousand of job and endanger energy security for all of we do the energy secretary refuse to defend uk interest because he be fund by billionaire eco zealot 
 i shall come to that very issue but i notice that the leader of the opposition do not say that she be brief about the chagos issue this be important when she become leader of the opposition i say to she that i would give she a briefing on any national security issue if she ask for it that be very important to the way that we run our democracy she have not ask for a briefing on the chagos case that be because she be more interested in chase reform than in national security 
 oil and gas will be part of our energy supply for many year to come we have be absolutely clear about that but we be go through a transition it be important because that transition to renewable energy will give we low bill and energy security it will take putin ’s foot off our throat and it will be good for the national interest 
 that be a weak answer because the prime minister do not know what be go on last week i ask about the employment bill he do not know what be go on we ask about the education bill he do not know what be go on let i tell he what be go on perhaps he can answer some   question shell have say that a year delay to rosebank will cost £ and the loss of job equinor have say that a year delay to jackdaw will cost £ the only benefit that i can see be the £ to labour ministers at a time of war in europe threaten energy security and increase competition from the us and elsewhere we should be get british oil and gas out of the ground do the prime minister have the gut to take on labour donor and his energy secretary and approve the licence application when they be resubmitte 
 the leader of the opposition do not even want to know what be go on otherwise she would have ask for the relevant briefing she know the position on rosebank she know that the court case have mean that the licence have to be review there be a process that have to be go through in the proper way she understand that but yet again she be prove that all she can do be student politic and play party politic 
 i be speak on behalf of the people of this country when labour negotiate our country lose the prime minister talk about bring growth and investment last week he lose a £ investment from astrazeneca that we negotiate which would have deliver growth immediately that same day he also lose the £ oilfield investment that would have deliver next year business be abandon the north sea because of his decision what signal do he think he be send to investor 
 as the leader of the opposition know astrazeneca ’s be a commercial decision she must understand that all she do be come here every week carp from the sideline talk our country down we have the high investment for year pwc say that we be the good place to invest in the world the international monetary fund have upgrade growth wage be up inflation be down there be more to do reform planning and regulation build new home and support a runway at heathrow what unite those champion by labour oppose by the tories 
 it be so hard to believe anything the prime minister say this be a man who need emergency voice coach on christmas eve this government be so clueless they be borrow £ for gb energy a vanity project that be not great not british and do not produce any energy its own chairman admit that it will take year to create just job meanwhile job be at stake in our oil and gas sector right now do the prime minister think that job in year time be worth more than the job that we have now 
 again the leader of the opposition clearly have not be brief or do not want to be brief gb energy will be a publicly own energy company that will drive the move to renewable it be not about the number of job in hq it be about the thousand upon thousand of job that it will generate to give we energy security which be something we do not have under the last government and take putin ’s boot off our throat something that do not happen under the last government they lose control of the economy we be get it back 
 the prime minister can waffle for as long as he like but we know that labour promise to bring energy bill down by £ instead bill be go up he be freeze pensioner while shovel money to mauritius the prime minister be not just manage decline he be create decline he have the power to grant these licence open these oil and gas field save british job and bring down bill why do he find it so hard to do the right thing 
 she really need to look into how these licence be grant i appreciate that the conservatives reset seem to be have no policy apart from cut pension and have no briefing on relevant issue let we just remind ourselves that they preside over the big drop in living standard on record mortgage go through the roof and they leave a £ black hole we learn last weekend that under the last government £ be lose on benefit fraud and error who be in the treasury at the time the shadow business secretary   the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith and the leader of the opposition they want to give lecture no thanks 
 the   hon   member for clacton nigel farage say that his party be open to anything when it come to change our nhs and open to an insurance base system will my right hon and learn friend confirm that under a labour government the nhs will be there for everyone when they need it not have to worry about the bill 
 the nhs be the lifeblood of our country and that be why we invest £ at the budget a record amount and be make it fit for the future through our plan for change what a contrast with reform whose leader have say that those who can afford to pay should pay for healthcare under labour the nhs will always be free at the point at use for anyone who need it 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 can i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about the terrible murder of the year old in sheffield and say that we support any effective action against knife crime that the government propose 
 at his prime minister ’s question i tell the prime minister about my constituent andrea a full time carer for her mother andrea be of thousand of carer catch up in the carer ’s allowance scandal hound by the department for work and pensions for repayment the prime minister accept that there be a problem and set up an independent review and we welcome that but month after the announcement of the review andrea receive a letter summon she to a tribunal next week her mother ’s health have be deteriorate she have have to go into a care home and this be the last thing andrea need will the prime minister step in and do the right thing and cancel andrea ’s tribunal and all proceeding against carer like andrea at least until the review be conclude 
 we set up the independent review and i know the right hon gentleman welcome that and it be the right thing to do i do not know the   detail of andrea ’s case but if he provide they to i i will certainly make sure that we have the detail and look into what have happen in her particular case 
 i be grateful for that reply the secretary of state for work and pensions write to i and be not interested in engage so i hope the prime minister will be 
 turn to foreign policy last night many of we be alarmed to hear president trump speak about forcibly displace people from gaza the prime minister have speak to the president on several occasion now do he personally believe that trump recognise the danger of statement like this to the fragile ceasefire in gaza and indeed to the security of both palestinians and israelis i be glad that the foreign secretary have confirm that the government ’s position be still a state solution i think that have support on all side of the house but will he reassure the house that this position and our concern on these dangerous statement from the president will be communicate to the white house directly and firmly 
 the right hon gentleman raise a very important issue the most important issue on the ceasefire be obviously that it be sustain and that we see it through the phase and that mean that the remain hostage come out and the aid that be desperately need get into gaza at speed and at the volume that be need 
 i have from the last few week image fix in my mind the be the image of emily damari reunite with her mother which i find extremely move the be the image of thousand of palestinians literally walk through the rubble to try to find their home and their community in gaza they must be allow home they must be allow to rebuild and we should be with they in that rebuild on the way to a state solution 
 the announcement of a runway at heathrow be obviously a massive boost to growth in the economy do my right hon and learn friend agree that it be important that the economic boost be spread around the uk and will he therefore agree to ask the relevant minister to meet i and other glasgow mps with the chamber of commerce to discuss the possibility of a new supply chain hub be create in the city where the material for heathrow ’s expansion could be reassemble 
 my hon friend be right that the new runway at heathrow can boost economic growth across the whole country it would boost the economy by billion and create over job across the uk with of the economic benefit outside london and the south east it be good for scottish passenger and scottish business and particularly for scottish salmon which be the no export pass through heathrow and have be worth £ over the past year i will happily ensure that she get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 i can assure   the hon member for rugby john slinger   that reform want healthcare to be free at the point of delivery—[interruption i be sorry mr speaker but there appear   to be some panic on the labour benches i be not surprised i would like to ask the prime minister for some advice—[interruption they really be panic be n’t they 
 get on with it 
 order i want to get to get this question over with do n’t you all you be do be ensure that it go on for ever quick question please 
 i would like to ask the prime minister for some advice what do i say to the constituent in clacton—[interruption 
 order either get on with it—[interruption order we can not both be stand mr farage i need a quick question and then i can get you the answer come on

 the bad thing that ever happen to anas sarwar 
 if he do not and he should do he think that it be strip scottish pensioner of their winter fuel payment abandon worker in grangemouth or attack the national insurance payment of farmer that have catastrophically torpedo labour in the poll in scotland when he do get a date he can even bring his chancellor with he to back he up on the number assume that she be still chancellor by then 
 i remember when that rhetoric use to come from snp members sit down there

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the negotiation of the transfer of sovereignty of the chagos island to mauritius 
 as we and mauritius have repeatedly say include in joint statement on   december   and   january both side remain committed to conclude a deal on the future of the chagos archipelago that protect the long term effective operation of the uk us base on diego garcia secure the long term future of the base have be and remain our primary objective throughout this process 
 follow technical talk between the uk and mauritius last month we have make very good progress towards this deal both side have agree that give the importance of the base to the united states as well as to we it be right that the new us administration have the chance to consider the full agreement properly as i discuss with   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   in yesterday ’s westminster hall debate we be closely engage with the administration include share the full detail of the agreement it would not be appropriate or usual for i to give a running commentary on the detail of those discussion or the agreement as i have say on a number of occasion parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise the deal in the usual way follow signature the government will bring forward a bill to implement the treaty 
 i must reiterate that the government inherit a situation where the long term future of the military base which be vital to uk and us security be under threat as opposition member know the previous government recognise that which be why they begin negotiation in and hold round of negotiation this government have secure a deal that protect the base for at least the next year a period that can be extend that mean that the uk and the us will be able to operate the base unchanged well into the next century 
 there will be clear commitment in the treaty for robust security arrangement include prevent the presence of foreign security force on the outer island and ensure that the base can continue to operate securely and effectively we would only agree a deal that we be confident protect our national security and that of our ally 
 the mauritian parliament have the opportunity yesterday to debate this at length but it seem the minister be perhaps rather more reluctant to be here today 
 jonathan powell our national security adviser have be do the round in washington where he have be tell everybody include member of the new us cabinet that this be necessary that we have to give away the sovereignty of the chagos island and that in those circumstance a negotiate year lease be the good option but that be just not true be it it be not true at all it do not stand there be no legal basis on which we have to give away the sovereignty of the chagos   island an advisory judgment from the international criminal court have no force of legal power whatsoever indeed america disregard it so much that it be not even a member 
 the americans by the way have be pretty busy with foreign policy just lately so it be perhaps no wonder that diego garcia have not be high on their agenda but when they wake up to the fact that this have be do wholly unnecessarily i would not be surprised if we find ourselves together with the european union in their tariff regime 
 can the minister confirm that there be no bind legal basis for this transfer of sovereignty whatsoever 
 the hon gentleman go over ground that he have go over before with question i have answer in this house and indeed which be discuss in yesterday ’s debate we have be very clear as indeed be the previous government that this base be not on a secure footing this have be do in full agreement with the us national security apparatus across the piece he refer to the icc it be of course the international court of justice that make that judgment 
 we be very clear that the joint uk us base on diego garcia play a critical role in counter an array of threat to regional and international security and we will not scrimp on the security of that base or on the solidity of the agreement around it we will ensure that it be in operation well into the next century and that we be able to operate unimpeded as we do today that be exactly why the previous government recognise there be a problem and engage in this process and it be why we have bring that problem to a conclusion with a deal that protect our interest and the interest of the united states and that ensure the security of the base and its operation 
 as i have say once the treaty be sign it will be bring before the house for scrutiny before ratification in the usual way interruption i hear chuntere from the opposition benches i have to say the opposition seem to have collective amnesia over this issue they know full well the reason behind this many of they be member of the previous government they have hear what the prime minister just say on the leader of the opposition ’s attack we be very clear that this be about defend the uk ’s security put the base on a secure footing and secure that for the future for both we and our ally 
 at the most recent environmental audit committee sitting we hear about the importance of the chagos island for the marine environment can my hon friend tell we anything more about the specific reassurance we have have on that crucial area for the biodiversity of the marine environment and how that will be protect after this deal from the discussion that he have have 
 i thank my hon friend for his important question it be a delight to appear before his committee to discuss other matter just a few week ago this treaty reflect both party share commitment to uphold international environmental law include high conservation standard across the archipelago mauritius have express dedication to marine conservation and have align its global initiative to protect of   marine area by and its commitment under the sustainable development goal and establish a fit for purpose marine protect area be a crucial part of that we will work with mauritius very closely on this matter it be a very important part of the discussion and i be very glad we have be able to make the agreement that we have 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 let we be clear labour ’s disastrous deal be of the bad foreign policy failure in modern british history labour be surrender an absolutely critical strategic defence asset that we operate together with our close security partner now we be tell we will have to pay billion for the privilege of do so when labour negotiate britain lose and lose big time 
 while this house have be keep in the dark on the detail our counterpart in mauritius have not they have a robust debate in parliament which many of we watch on youtube it be just extraordinary the prime minister of mauritius give his parliament a detailed account and even a chronology of the deal and the negotiation that lead to it detail that labour repeatedly refuse to disclose to this house and which the prime minister of mauritius set out in no uncertain term so that nobody should be in any doubt 
 this weak hapless government have back down and the house deserve answer today have the minister give away our ability to unilaterally extend the period over which the uk can exercise sovereign right on diego garcia the mauritius prime minister say he have have the minister give away our ability to exercise sovereign right over diego garcia entirely if so what be the cost be it £ be it £ be it to be inflation proof as the mauritian prime minister state in parliament yesterday if the minister be frontloade payment what other service will be cut here in the united kingdom in the immediate term to make room and pay for the deal when labour be impose taxis on education family farm and business and have cut winter fuel payment for vulnerable pensioner how can this eye watering amount of money be justify to lease back a territory for which guess what we already own the freehold 
 will the minister also say whether he will have to make defence cut to absorb this enormous cost should the ministry of defence be shoulder the cost what budget will it come from will the government count the payment towards the defence target 
 on the sovereignty of basis do the deal pose a new precedent for other basis such as cyprus the mauritius prime minister say last month that his attorney general meet the minister and the uk attorney general will the minister confirm what be discuss importantly may i ask again if the government think this be such a good deal do he stand by that and will he defend our interest 
 i have to say again to the right hon lady that it be her government a government that she be part of who start the negotiation and go through round of negotiation she know full well the reason why quite frankly i find it extraordinary for she to talk about defence and the national security   of this country when we be have to rebuild and clear up the mess that her government make of our armed force and our defence i be very glad to be join on the front bench by the minister for the armed forces my hon friend   the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard it be this government who be rebuild our defence increase our spending and deliver for our armed force and national security around the world indeed this agreement be a crucial part of that a lot of the figure be speculate about in the medium should as i say yesterday be take with a pinch of salt we have be clear there be no change to the substance or the quantum in relation to this agreement 
 the right hon lady raise inflation i be surprised she mention that because indexation be there in the public statement make about the negotiation on   october indeed it be part of the agreement from her government so i be very surprised that she ask that question 
 lastly i be deeply disappointed as be our friend in the overseas territory around the world that constant false comparison keep be make with our other basis and our other overseas territory this be not a read across situation we be committed to our base on cyprus we be commit to gibraltar we be committed to the falklands we have be absolutely and resolutely clear about that to continue to suggest that there be some sort of threat to they quite frankly undermine our national security and do not strengthen it in any way 
 do the minister agree that despite the member for the trump government ’s misrepresentation the uk government must provide their own independent global leadership base on uk value and uk interest to make a safe world despite or because of the new us administration ’s change foreign policy include close the united states agency for international development and on the chagos island 
 i set out yesterday in a very important debate on our bilateral relation with the united states just how much we be co operate already with the new us administration on defence security and our shared priority around growth and prosperity we be absolutely committed in our wide international obligation we have set that out the minister for development my right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds   have set that out and my colleague have set that out in relation to climate change we will continue to work with the united states on all the global challenge we face 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i put on record the deep concern of the liberal democrats at the way this deal have progress 
 we accept the icj ruling i think there be a consensus across the house on the importance of the uk uphold the rule of law so i be bemuse by the confected consternation of those on the conservative benches it be the then foreign secretary   the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly who in state 
 it be our intention to secure an agreement on the basis of international law to resolve all outstanding issues”—[official report   november vol c. 27ws 
 but under this labour government chagossians have be ignore parliament be without a say and the lack of foresight on how the us presidential election might affect the deal be troubling after fail to force through an agreement ministers have now give donald trump a say about the future of sovereign british territory can the minister confirm that before signature this house will be give a vote on the term of the final deal in particular to see how uk security interest have be protect 
 i have set out on a number of occasion why the deal be right for our national security interest and those of our ally i have also set out very clearly the normal process it will go through parliament 
 i thank the minister for his response to the urgent question i listen carefully to the concern of   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   about the deal if those concern be about the possible cost then give that his entry in the register of members financial interests state that he have earn nearly £ in the past month since his election perhaps the minister might agree with i that the hon gentleman could make a donation to the government to secure our national security 
 order i be sure you want to ask a serious question 
 thank you mr speaker apology will the minister reassure i as he have in his response and in countless statement before that when the treaty come before the house secure our national security will be paramount through a process that as he say be start under the previous government 
 we will not scrimp on national security as i have say there have be no change to the substance of the deal or the overall quantum agree we will present the process in the usual way as i have say multiple occasion 
 i want to try to be helpful to the minister i be the deputy foreign secretary throughout much of the negotiation and i be in a position to tell the house that neither my right hon friend   the member for braintree mr cleverly   nor the noble lord cameron in the other place would ever as foreign secretary have do the deal that the government be now intent upon i think the minister must be pray every night for a get out of jail free card that when the american administration come to look at the deal they will veto it and get the government off the hook 
 i set out very clearly the reason for the do the deal it be the right deal for our national security and that of our ally the right hon gentleman know that because his government start the process we be engage in constructive discussion with our us counterpart it be absolutely right that they have the chance to consider the deal we will allay any concern raise and that have be raise in the house previously in term of the security provision they have be provide with the full detail of the agreement 
 the hon member for clacton nigel farage   say he want to help uk relation with the us but he have a very funny way of go about it opposition member state over and over again that they understand the desire and the psyche of the us military and its people yet they ignore the fact that the icj ruling aside the previous and present us administration understand the language of business and agreement and not the gentleman ’s agreement that have in the past mar discussion and negotiation about the stability and persistent military presence on the island it be for that reason that i ask the minister if he agree that the confirmation of the legal status of the base will cement our role in the indo pacific and put we in a strong position to counter chinese influence in the region 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about protect against malign interest that be exactly at the heart of the deal he be also exactly right about the history of why the deal be need that be of course recognise by the previous government which be why they start the negotiation we want to put the base on a secure footing well into the next century which be what i assume they be try to do previously and spend round negotiate we have come to a deal that be in our national interest most crucially it be our national security and that of our ally that be at the heart of it there be multiple safeguard in place in the treaty they will protect our national security and that of our ally 
 give that what the minister have tell the house today be so at variance with the report from the prime minister of mauritius surely it ring alarm bell in his mind about the nature of the polity and the individual with whom he be negotiate and have he entirely lose his moral compass the government be consider tax death in service benefit of our servicemen while at the same time contemplate spend £ on save a base that we already own 
 i be not go to reflect on the appalling record of the right hon gentleman ’s government on defence and our service people we be get around to rebuild our relationship with our armed force and rebuild our defence in view of the global threat that we face 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the mauritian prime minister who be of course responsible for his own word i certainly do not recognise some of the commentary that there have be over the last hour it be clear that there have be no change in the substance of the deal or in the overall quantum agree 
 the minister have describe the conversation he have have with american ally but can he update the house on the conversation he have have with the wide nato partnership give the consequence that this could have for they 
 our nato membership be utterly crucial we have a nato strategy the prime minister have meet the secretary general in the last hour and i be with nato colleague at the north atlantic council just before christmas we be absolutely clear   in our commitment to our nato ally and our commitment to the united states they form a bedrock of our security in a globally uncertain time and that be also why we need to secure the base into the long term future 
 a few week ago i have the privilege of meet a large group of chagossians who have come from in some case as far away as france to discuss with member of parliament their feeling about this deal i be of only mp who turn up and the chagossians be devastate by that turnout they tell we that they have not be in any way meaningfully consult about the deal so the minister have a challenge on his hand he tell the house that meaningful negotiation and discussion have take place he have a choice today he can either tell we precisely what those consultation and negotiation be or correct the record 
 i be rather confused by that question because i have be very clear about the engagement that i have have with member of the chagossian community there be and i have give the date on which they take place we continue to engage with member of that community in fact my official will meet some of they next week and i look forward to meet they again in due course 
 as i have say many time before i respect the range of differ view within the chagossian community for example the chagos refugees group of the large chagossian group have welcome the agreement there be a range of chagossian group around the world as the hon gentleman know and we will continue to engage with they and listen to all their view i can assure he that the interest of chagossians be at the heart of this agreement 
 the minister like the prime minister before he keep imply that if member of this house be arm with the same information that they be arm with they would come to the same decision well i be arm with the information that the minister have at his disposal i do not come to the same decision and neither do my direct successor lord cameron of chipping norton do the minister the other ministers in the government and the official who work on their behalf understand that the point of a negotiation be not to get any deal but to get a good deal and that if you do not get a good deal you should walk away from the table as we do 
 as i say early the right hon gentleman recognise that there be a problem he start the negotiating process and they go through round this be a good deal and that be why we have agree it 
 for year an international rule base system have be the cornerstone of both our economic prosperity as the hundred of billion waste on a pointless brexit have illustrate and our security china do not get that russia do not get that and the current occupant of the white house do not seem to get that do the government get that 
 we be absolutely clear about the fact that national security be our top priority we need to maintain our security in all part of the world we be in very dangerous geopolitical circumstance as i think all member recognise and that be exactly why we be invest in our defence in our nato partnership and in our relationship with the united states our european counterpart and many other we will always put the national security of our citizen and our country 
 i have ask the minister this question before but if he will forgive i for say so his answer could have benefit from additional clarity so with your permission mr speaker i be go to ask it again 
 the minister have make it very clear as have his fellow minister that the urgency and necessity of action in this instance be base on the imminence of an adverse court judgment against the uk he know that the international court of justice be not the court that we must be think of here because the united kingdom be not subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the icj when it concern dispute involve member or former member of the commonwealth so it can not be an icj judgment that the minister be worried about can it if it be not that what be it 
 i have explain on a number of occasion and the last government know the reason why it be necessary to proceed with a deal to secure the future operation of the base that be very clear and why our ally want we to secure it 
 let i give the right hon and learn gentleman an example we currently have unrestricte and sole access to the electromagnetic spectrum which be use to communicate with satellite and which be guarantee and govern by the international telecommunication union a united nations body base in geneva if we lose it we can still communicate but so can other that be of many example there be a series of aspect that be important to the operation and the security of the base its maintenance into the future and its ability to operate unimpeded i can tell the right hon and learn gentleman that all those consideration and the protection that we have secure have be part of why we have reach this deal we would not have agree a deal that do not secure the unimpeded operation of the base into the future and also leave it continually at risk as it be at present 
 we have not be able to obtain any fact from the government about the cost the deal be of course inflation link and we do not know what inflation will be in the future we do however know fact the base be crucial to our national interest secondly china be seek to expand its influence across the indian ocean and africa and thirdly the mauritian government will have clear unambiguous sovereignty over the island how can the minister anticipate that our interest be safeguard if he do not know what relationship future mauritian government will have with china 
 i have answer that question on a number of occasion mauritius be of the few african country not to join the belt and road initiative its alliance be with india and we have clear guarantee in the treaty set out the protection against malign   interest on the outer island and indeed in the surround area that be why the whole united states security apparatus agree to this we would not have agree a deal that do not protect 
 let i give some example the uk have full control over diego garcia include control over the electromagnetic spectrum and unrestricted access to and from the base there be a buffer zone around diego garcia in which nothing can be build or put in place without uk consent and of course there be the various different robust mechanism and review process to ensure that no activity in the outer island or the surround area can impinge on the operation of the base the right hon gentleman can be assure that we would not have agree a deal that would allow any malign force wherever it might be in the world to use the space around the island or to interfere with our operation this be about put the base on a secure footing into the future for our national security and that of our ally 
 the prime minister and the minister just now have stress the strategic importance of the military base at diego garcia can the minister make it clear that there will be no restriction in the lease as to what the base can be use for or what might be store there and that the uk will have the right to extend that lease when it expire 
 i can absolutely confirm that there will be no change in the operation of the base that be the basis on which this agreement be found along with all the provision and protection within it as i explain in early answer the lease be for year with the possibility of an extension at the end of it 
 can the minister assure we that he will not be drag down the road of rebuild the empire as he be invite to do by   the hon member for clacton nigel farage and will he also confirm that in international law the chagos island in their entirety have become part of mauritius should we not be concentrate on the right of return of all chagossians to the island for which they have be campaign ever since the 1980 when they be so disgracefully remove this be an issue of decolonisation and of the chagossians right of return i should be grateful if the minister confirm that any agreement with mauritius will include their automatic right of return to the archipelago and their right at least to visit and if necessary reside briefly in diego garcia they have suffer too long and too hard and they have be treat so brutally that they deserve justice 
 the primary purpose here be national security and ensure the functioning of the base but the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the issue of the chagossians and their treatment in the past which we all agree be wrong and their interest be absolutely at the heart of this agreement it will mean that for the time we can resume visit to all the island include diego garcia with the appropriate protection in place hopefully it will allow settlement on the outer island which be part of our discussion with mauritius on the treaty of course the chagossians can subject to the relevant security clearance work on   diego garcia as well we recognise their land graf and history and our package of measure to support the chagossian community both globally through a trust fund and here in the uk will be very important those be some of the issue on which we look forward to engage with chagossian representative over the week to come 
 the us have the most substantial interest in diego garcia which be the fulcrum of what we be discuss today although i understand that the minister can not disclose the detail of the compensatory package that be be negotiate be it reasonable to assume that the us will be make a substantial contribution to that compensatory package 
 as i have say i be not go to give a running commentary on the discussion what i will say be that the full detail be be share with the current us administration and it be absolutely right that they have the chance to consider they we be always be accuse of rush but this have be go on for more than year there have be lengthy round of discussion and lengthy round of negotiation mostly under the previous government but it be absolutely right that the new us administration have time to consider the deal and to be provide with the detail particularly around security issue so that they can be absolutely sure about the security of the base and its operation into the future which be in their interest and our 
 it be outrageous that we only know the detailed speculation about this deal because of the briefing from the mauritian prime minister to his member of parliament it be outrageous that the amount of money be talk about now be £ which be enough to pay for the winter fuel allowance for all our pensioner for the next year the minister will not tell this house the actual quantum of money that he be discuss with mauritius can he put it on the record now and can he tell we out of which departmental budget it need to be pay 
 i can tell the hon lady that the figure that she pull out be categorically untrue she have the answer in her question she say speculation there be a huge amount of speculation and i would take the vast majority of it with a pinch of salt 
 my right hon and learn friend   the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright   speak incredibly slowly and incredibly clearly so much so that even i understand his question however the minister do not actually give he an answer when we join the icj we do so on the basis of a carve out that mean that no ruling by the icj in respect of commonwealth or former commonwealth country could be bind on his majesty ’s government be it the icj that he be concerned about or another court 
 as we have say repeatedly the base be not on a sustainable footing this deal put it on a sustainable footing 
 what do it say about this government ’s priority that they will deny pensioner the winter fuel payment leave   waspi woman with nothing and fail to support job on merseyside by support astrazeneca at speke and that they should be contemplate an emergency budget to raise more taxis on hard work british people while spaffe £ on mauritius 
 i be not entirely sure what the right hon gentleman ’s question be if he be talk about the previous government ’s economic legacy to this we have a substantial disagreement the fact be that we be pick up the piece from the mess in which his government leave the country economically and crucially in term of our national defence we will not scrimp when it come to our national security we will not scrimp when it come to our armed force and we will not scrimp when it come to our overseas basis and our commitment to our ally that be exactly why we be get this deal 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 there have never be a satisfactory explanation as to why this deal be rush out hour before a very unpopular government call a general election in mauritius which create the impression that this government be attempt to interfere in mauritius ’s democratic process the outcome be that the mauritian government secure only seat in their parliament in the general election can the minister finally tell we why it be imperative to rush the deal out in that timeframe hour before an election be call 
 again i refer to my previous statement there have be no rush we have be engage with our mauritian counterpart and the united states administration and we believe that we have a deal that meet all the interest of those involve and crucially that protect our national security there be no rush 
 this matter must be so important if it consume so much of the minister ’s credibility and £ of taxpayer money would think there would be more than government back benchers here to speak about it be it that they do not care or do they lack the literacy to discuss these issue the minister say on the today programme this morning that we have pass the situation on to the white house that we await its feedback and that when we receive it we will know exactly where we stand as a government be that the type of sovereignty he be after 
 there be so many different bit of the hon gentleman ’s question that i do not recognise for a start i be not on the today programme this morning so i do not know who he be refer to i certainly do not recognise the figure of £ so i do not understand at all what he be get at 
 the minister confirm to i in a write answer last week that we will not have a unilateral ability to extend the agreement in december the minister for the armed forces   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard say that he be confident that member   would back it when we see the detail this be seemingly a renegotiated deal and we have not see the detail of the original deal or this deal what be the difference between the previous deal and the renegotiated deal and when will the detail be present to member of this house
