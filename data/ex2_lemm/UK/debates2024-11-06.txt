 however there be some downside to my constituency it be very expensive to buy or rent a home which be price out young people and family the median price of a house in my constituency be time the average salary and the rental market follow on from that basically it be unaffordable for many people on top of that a lot of our affordable housing be badly insulate and people rely on oil for their heating across my constituency there be family who can not afford to heat their home as the government be rebuild britain which i hope that we can do they should ensure that home be build that be affordable for people to live in not just home that have an affordable price or rent but that be energy efficient so that they be cheap to run we must also ensure that we have the infrastructure and support around those home whether that be doctor dentist school green space or water we need to have all those thing 
 on the subject of dentist ely and east cambridgeshire be a dental desert i be horrified to say that people can not get on an nhs dental list in my constituency that have to change i have meet people who have spend their life saving on dental treatment or people who for heaven ’s sake have do it themselves it be horrendous and we have to address it

 i be delighted that the right hon lady have read the deal that we write but the fact be simple despite the protest this be the same deal that be previously negotiate by the last conservative government involve the same amount of money to build the electric arc furnace and the same cash for the transition board it be ludicrous for she or other to continue to claim that no support be in place and that it somehow appear when she find it down the back of the sofa she be fully aware that the cash have be sit there the whole time perhaps an apology be need for that and for claim that port talbot supply the defence industry with material 
 if an apology be due it be to the people of port talbot for promise £ for a transition board that operate for month under the previous secretary of state for wales and deliver not a single penny to the people of port talbot and now we know why the £ do not exist 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the closure of the last blast furnace at port talbot have result in the loss of several highly skilled job across south wales prompt another economic contraction across our region the global centre for rail excellence at onllwyn be project that could reverse the trend of deindustrialisation and bring back good well pay job to south wales will the secretary of state confirm that the uk government intend to make further investment in that project and give an update on what conversation she have have to ensure that the project get go

 what step she be take to strengthen the union 
 what step she be take to strengthen the union 
 we have reset our relationship with the welsh government our approach be base on trust and mutual respect and be spearhead by the new council of the nations and regions which meet for the time last month my regular meeting with the minister of wales be also drive forward our new partnership which be already deliver for wales that be evident in the big ever real term budget settlement deliver for the welsh government last week 
 the secretary of state have be clear that this labour government will build a new partnership with the welsh government base on co operation respect and delivery will she say how the government will give meaning to the manifesto commitment to strengthen devolution 
 the previous conservative government run roughshod over the devolution settlement include by legislate in devolve area without consent on numerous occasion this government will respect the devolution settlement and work in partnership with all devolve government we will honour our manifesto   commitment to do that by strengthen the sewel convention include a new memorandum of understanding between our government ensure that the petty squabble of the past be confine to history and we can focus on deliver for the people of wales 
 the secretary of state have be very clear about the much need reset between the welsh and uk government can she also make clear how the recent budget have contribute to that reset 
 our budget deliver for wales for the time in a generation because the £ settlement announce last week be the large settlement in real term since the dawn of devolution it will provide a record boost for the welsh government to support vital public service in wales such as the nhs it include £ to maintain work to keep coal tip safe and £ for investment zone in north and south wales to power our sector strength which include the creative industry life science and advanced manufacturing for example our world lead compound semiconductor cluster that show the difference of labour government work together 
 may i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies who have just take on the role of shadow secretary of state for wales it be a fantastic opportunity for she to champion a vital part of our union secondly may i ask the secretary of state who be newly in her post what she will do to ensure that the power that bring our union together come out of ynys môn that be anglesey to she so that she can ensure that the nuclear project that keep we safe be properly invest in and not drop as they have be by this labour government labour government control both side of the m4 now and it be about time they deliver

 could the secretary of state explain how it be possible to strengthen the union while maintain a partition border in the irish sea at the behest of a foreign jurisdiction and under its law 
 i refer the hon and learn gentleman to my previous answer about the resetting of the relationship with the welsh government and about work together and respect the devolution settlement with all devolve government

 in the budget the chancellor announce that the barnett formula would apply to funding for agriculture rather than the devolve government receive a ringfenced amount the farmers union of wales say that the barnettisation of funding could lead to a cut of £ a year or more than can the secretary of state say whether that figure be correct and whether she believe that her government ’s budget have show any consideration at all for our farming community 
 i be very pleased that the budget be able to protect the current farming budget for the next financial year despite the difficult decision that we have to make because the conservative party have trash our economy interruption

 we say the phrase no farmer no food so often but never have there be a need for such emphasis as in the wake of the autumn budget farmer in wales in northern ireland and right across this united kingdom be reel from the change in agricultural property relief and the impact it will have on the future of family farm what be the secretary of state do to support farmer and make this case to the treasury

 we be not threaten gp surgery if the right hon lady do not think that the £ additional funding to spend on the nhs in wales as a result of the budget be a great idea she need to say what she would do instead

 as leader of his majesty ’s opposition i will be take a different approach to the last opposition by be a constructive opposition so i would like to start by congratulate president elect trump on his impressive victory this morning the prime minister and the foreign secretary meet he in september do the foreign secretary take that opportunity to apologise for make derogatory and scatological reference include 
 trump be not only a woman hat neo nazi sympathise sociopath he be also a profound threat to the international order 
 if he do not apologise will the prime minister do so now on his behalf 
 there will be many issue on which the leader of the opposition and i disagree but there will be issue that unite this house on national security and ukraine i look forward to work closely with she on that i will provide she with the information that she need to discharge her duty that be the right thing for the country and it be far more important than party politic the foreign secretary and i do meet president elect trump just a few week ago for dinner   for about a couple of hour we discuss a number of issue of global significance it be a very constructive exercise 
 the prime minister do not distance himself from the remark make by the foreign secretary and i be very sure that president trump will soon be call to thank he for send all of those north london labour activist to campaign for his opponent give that most of his cabinet sign a motion to ban president trump from address parliament will the prime minister show that he and his government can be more than student politician by ask the speaker to extend—[interruption 
 order mr perkins i do not need any more your voice carry it be like mine too loud 
 will the prime minister show that he and his government can be more than student politician by ask you mr speaker to extend an invitation to president trump to address parliament on his next visit 
 the leader of the opposition be give a masterclass on student politic but seriously we live in probably a more volatile world than we have live in for many decade it be absolutely crucial that we have a strong relationship that strong special relationship forge in difficult circumstance between the us and the uk we will continue to work as we have do in our month in government on issue of security our economy and global conflict 
 the prime minister do not answer the question he just read the line the official have prepare for he it do not sound like he want to invite president elect trump to parliament he need to look after the special relationship the us be our single big trade partner give the risk of increase tariff on uk export which threaten our manufacturing sector will the prime minister commit now to continue the negotiation on our free trade agreement with the us which the biden administration cancel when they come into office 
 of course we will discuss issue of our economy with the president elect as we already have do economy security and global conflict be issue of real significance that ought to unite this house when it come to the economy what we have do with our budget be to fix the foundation after year and return economic stability after the £ black hole we have protect the payslip of work people we have make the single big investment in our country for a generation in the nhs school and home we have give a pay rise to the lowest pay if the leader of the opposition be oppose to that investment or the pay rise for work people she be a straight talker as i understand it perhaps she should say so 
 discuss discuss discuss chat chat chat the prime minister have no plan whatsoever for build on the special relationship he need to realise that we in this country rely on our single big trade partner president trump be also right to argue that europe need to increase its defence spending the last   conservative government commit to raise defence spending to of gdp by will the prime minister finally match that commitment 
 there be no more important duty than keep the people of this country safe it be the labour government who sign the nato treaty in the place and we be strong supporter we have a strategic defence review and we be commit to interruption i remind conservative members that the last time be meet be under the last labour government year and they never do it once last year the national audit office identify a £ black hole in the ministry of defence finance the former defence secretary say that the previous government hollow out the armed force the plan that the conservatives put forward at the election be pure fantasy 
 the prime minister will not make that commitment that be very clear all that he be do interruption 
 order i be go to hear the question if there be people who do not want to hear they they can leave now 
 the prime minister will not make that commitment yet the world be get more dangerous his chancellor ’s budget do not even mention defence the chancellor ’s budget last week be a copy and paste of bidenomics it turn out that a high spending high borrowing and high inflation approach be less popular than she may have think may i suggest that he now urge she to change course or be he determined to be a term leader 
 the thing that i learn as leader of the opposition be that it be a good idea to listen to what the government be actually say i think the right hon lady just say that defence be not mention in the budget it be day ago that it be absolutely clear and central to the budget as be economic growth we be fix the foundation we be give a pay rise to million of people we be pick up the mess that the conservatives leave include the £ black hole and give a pay rise to work people i have not yet hear she welcome that pay rise for the low pay worker do she now welcome it or do she stick to her previous policy that it be excessive 
 i be the who as business secretary raise the minimum wage last year i have a strong record on this we need to make sure that we balance the book the prime minister ’s scripted line show that he have not even listen to the budget himself so i will try a different question perhaps he can give something that be unscripted to the people who be watch 
 farmer across the united kingdom—[laughter mr speaker—[interruption 
 order i do not need any help if anybody want to leave i will help they do that i be go to hear the question and i certainly want to hear the answer as well so please let we have some courtesy 
 we have hear the prime minister on television repeat the line fix the foundation and so on over and over again but what do he say to farmer who be face uncertainty about their future as a result of the increase taxis announce by the chancellor i be very clear that we would reverse labour ’s cruel family farm tax hon member read what can he say now to reassure the farming community hon member reading!”]—who provide security for the whole nation 
 i be happy to help the leader of the opposition if she be go to complain about scripted answer it be probably good not to read that from a script hon member more i be glad that she raise the issue of farmer because the budget last week put £ over the next year into farming that be the single big increase unlike the £ underspend under the last government when it come to inheritance the vast vast majority of farmer will be unaffected as she and her party well know 
 the budget be about fix the foundation fix the £ hole that the conservatives leave and invest in the future of our country invest in our nhs our school our hospital and our home i be proud that we be make that investment if the opposition oppose it they should go out there and tell their constituent that they be against that investment in the future of our country that be the difference a labour government take we forward the conservatives be stick in the past

 president elect trump praise vladimir putin ’s invasion of ukraine he call it genius he also say that he would encourage russia 
 to do whatever the hell they want 
 to nato ally so what action be the prime minister take to encourage a trump presidency to change its mind otherwise it be a huge threat to global security and national security in the uk do the prime minister agree that if the us will not oppose president putin and support our brave ukrainian ally the uk must lead in europe so that together we do 
 i be very proud that in this house we be unite on the question of ukraine and clear about russian aggression and we will continue to be so i have long take the view that the only winner if we be divide in this house be putin and i be not prepared to let that happen our relationship with the us be a strong relationship forge in very difficult circumstance historically it remain as strong today as it be when it be forge and i look forward to work with president elect trump to ensure that that relationship stay the special relationship 
 i be grateful for the prime minister ’s comment on ukraine but donald trump have also say that trade war be good he call himself tariff man people be really worried that trump ’s trade war and tariff will damage our economy damage business and hit the cost of live here in the uk give that do the prime minister recognise that it be more urgent than ever that we support our british economy by get rid of the damaging trade barrier with europe put in place by the conservatives 
 as the right hon member will know we make the economy the centrepiece of our budget and we will do everything that we need to do to ensure that our economy grow and that be measure in living standard go up for work people across the country 
 many family across aldershot and farnborough have struggle for year to get their child with special educational need the help that they need it be therefore shameful to read the misguided claim make by the leader of the opposition that autistic people 
 may well get well treatment 
 and receive economic privilege and protection will the prime minister stand with the family of autistic child and distance the government from those awful word 
 i will leave the leader of the opposition to respond to those word as the recent national audit office report expose child with special educational need and disability be be fail by the system under the previous government this have come up i think time in the last or week at pmq it be clearly a serious issue our focus will be on ensure that every child receive the right support to succeed in their education

 the hon member be right to draw attention to that issue misogyny and abuse both online and offline cause horrendous harm to woman and girl across the uk i commend she for her honesty and bravery in speak out about her own experience and for her dedication to create safe space for woman in her constituency we must create a safe world online for woman and girl through the online safety act mitigate the risk of illegal content and activity that be abusive or incite hatre 
 everyone in southwark will benefit from the positive measure in last week ’s budget especially the thousand of people on minimum wage who will get a real term increase to help themselves their family and the economy the new leader of the tory party this week ’s leader be on record as say that she want to scrap the minimum wage have seemingly learn nothing from july will the prime minister pledge to protect the minimum wage and increase it in this parliament as finance allow 
 the previous labour government transform the labour market with the national minimum wage that be oppose by the conservatives at the time and sadly they do not seem to have change i be surprise by the comment of the leader of the opposition i be surprised to see the new shadow business secretary say that the minimum wage be 
 something that legislator pass to make themselves feel good 
 i disagree i be very proud of the fact that this labour government have raise wage for low pay worker and i expect the conservative party to welcome that 
 after year shape the uk ’s long term strategy for life science agritech fusion and space i welcome the government ’s industrial strategy however too many of our great company be be buy out by our competitor to build the industry of tomorrow here we need to unlock some of the hundred of billion of pound in uk pension fund in the city only of which be now invest in uk equity with the new lord mayor make that a priority and the mansion house speech imminent will the new government commit to see through the previous government ’s reform to unlock british capital for british research and development growth

 the river wye be of our most important and iconic river and we be work closely with the welsh government on that press issue the destruction of our waterway should never have be allow that be why we have launch a water commission to attract investment and speed up infrastructure delivery and why we have introduce legislation to enable tough penalty and severe fine to crack down on polluter i will ensure that my hon friend get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 i call the father of the house 
 as a good lawyer the prime minister will want to listen to the evidence so if evidence mount from expert and organisation such as the national farmers union that small family farm of average size—250 acre will be severely impact by the tax change will he in a spirit of compromise listen to that evidence keep an open mind and perhaps be prepared to raise the threshold in order to preserve our family farm 
 we be listen to farmer and the environment secretary and treasury ministers meet with the nfu on monday we have take a fair and balanced approach the vast vast majority of farm will not be affect what i will also say be that have grow up in a rural community i know that rural community also need an nhs that be back on its foot school that their child can go to and home that their family can afford to live in but we will continue to talk to the nfu and other 
 this week the leader of the opposition tell we that any outrage at suitcase full of wine and karaoke machine in downing street while people across the country be tell to stay at home be all overblown for the people and business in my constituency who follow the rule many of we at great personal cost this be an insult will the prime minister join i in ensure that we as a country learn the lesson from covid and that the conservatives as a party learn the lesson of their behaviour too 
 across the country people make enormous sacrifice during covid they miss wedding birth and death really important moment in their and their family life in do so they save the life of people they will probably never meet that be a collective effort and unfortunately the party opposite who set the rule do not follow they themselves it be a betrayal of those who do and i think the leader of the opposition be wrong to describe the public anger and upset as overblown i be sure she will want to clarify that at the opportunity 
 i call llinos medi 
 diolch llefarydd representative of glan rhos nursing home in my constituency tell i that the budget change mean a increase in their in year cost a staggering £ extra will the prime minister reconsider the rise in employer national insurance 
 what we do in last week ’s budget be ensure that no would face tax rise in their payslip we have to deal with the £ black hole but when we do so we protect the small business and charity we double the employment allowance to £ mean that of employer will not pay employer national insurance contribution company with employee or few on the minimum wage will pay no employer nic at all and half of business that pay nic will see no change or pay less after the budget 
 my   constituent be pleased to hear last week ’s budget prioritise investment in public infrastructure include important project such as the electrification of the wigan to bolton railway line which will deliver more reliable and greener journey do the prime minister agree that investment in the key infrastructure of town such as horwich westhoughton blackrod and bolton be the only way to deliver economic growth and prosperity for all

 the hon lady will be pleased to know that i have be to berkhamste a number of time as we have very good friend who live there i pay tribute to the work of the swan youth project too many young people she cite some of they be struggle with mental health and not receive the support they need that be why we will recruit an additional mental health worker and be introduce long overdue reform   to the mental health act that be happen today we will put more money into send but we also need to look at reform send which i think and hope will be support across the house i will ensure that she get a meeting with the relevant ministers about that 
 my right hon friend the prime minister will know that after year of tory ideological hostility and cut our university be in financial meltdown the university of east anglia in my constituency be have to make redundancy as be many other our right hon friend the secretary of state for education have start to address the problem but we need a long term solution that do not simply saddle our young people with more debt can my right hon friend the prime minister say how we can move to fix the foundation of high education as we go forward 
 my hon friend be right to raise high education we inherit a sector face severe financial challenge university have suffer a real term decline in their income and the gap between disadvantaged student and their peer be the high on record we have have to take tough decision to put that on a secure footing but we be also take the step of ease live pressure by increase maintenance loan which be worth an extra £ per year 
 jo hamilton my constituent and a former sub postmistress have long campaign with alan bates for compensation follow the horizon post office scandal can the prime minister give an exact timeframe in which those who have be wait more than a decade might finally be compensate 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise this important issue a commitment be make to properly compensate the victim of this scandal unfortunately the conservative government have make that commitment regrettably do not allocate any money her constituent will be pleased to know that we have change the approach we have set out the compensation within the budget a transparent accountable budget and we will make the payment as soon as we can 
 i echo the prime minister ’s sentiment towards that other son of lewis although i wish that i have wake up today in the isle of harris my constituent there face long delay cancellation and loss of service because of the snp ’s incompetent handling of ferry procurement in last week ’s budget the scottish government receive a record settlement may i urge the prime minister to tell scottish ministers to use that to improve public service in scotland to invest in the nhs in na h eileanan an iar to build school in place such as barra and finally to fix the ferry fiasco 
 last week in the budget we deliver the large settlement for the scottish government in real term since devolution that include £ through the barnett formula a fuel duty freeze and an increase to the national living wage benefit my hon friend ’s constituent and all those across scotland the   result of the budget be now clear the snp in power in scotland have the power and they now have the money so they have no more excuse 
 do the prime minister think it be acceptable for a back bench mp to suggest that the leader of the opposition represent white supremacy in blackface and be 
 the most prominent member of white supremacy ’s black collaborator class 
 with all the race traitor innuendo that that carry if he do not why have he not remove the whip 
 no i do not 
 as a semi retired violinist and rock musician ask a semi retired multi instrumentalist i feel confident that the prime minister share my belief in the importance of music education do he agree that as we unleash the potential of our country we must invest in the educational infrastructure of creative art subject so that they be accessible to all and will he visit my constituency to see the great work of the school there despite the inheritance that we receive 
 i be not sure about the description semi retired although that may be the wish of the conservative party what i know from personal experience be that music the creative subject and art be really important not only for the pleasure and knowledge that they give to child and young people but for the experience of work in group and leadership that be why we be determined to ensure that they be count as subject again in the curriculum which will encourage many more school to provide they in the curriculum and enrich the future of child and young people across the country 
 before the election the prime minister claim that he would not put up national insurance contribution he put they up before   the election he claim that he would scrap tuition fee he put they up before the election he say that he would not tax family farm he be tax they will he address his party ’s grow reputation for dishonesty by make good on his commitment to close the wethersfield asylum accommodation centre in my constituency 
 we be keep the promise that we make in our manifesto the right hon gentleman ’s problem be that he can not add up if he could he might be down on the front bench rather than up on the back benches we will take up the issue in his constituency 
 monday mark the year anniversary of my constituent jagtar singh johal ’s arbitrary detention in india can the prime minister assure i that he and his government will do all they can to secure jagtar ’s immediate release and bring he home 
 yes we be committed to push the government of india on this important case the foreign secretary have raise it and will continue to do so and we will ensure that we speak to my hon friend as we do so 
 that complete prime minister ’s question 
 on a point of order mr speaker do the leader of the opposition want to correct the record as she say in prime minister ’s question that the chancellor do not mention defence spending in her budget yet the chancellor mention it many many time include its allocation of £ which far exceed our commitment 
 it be not for i to correct the record and that be not a point of order but the right hon lady have do it 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department to make a statement on the recent increase in dangerous illegal and unnecessary channel crossing by small boat 
 for too long smuggling gang have be undermine our border security and put life at risk which be why the new government have make it a top priority to address the crisis we inherit let we be clear about what that crisis entail small boat crossing in the half of the year at their high point on record and over arrival in the year prior over case stick in the asylum system cost the taxpayer billion in support and £ spend on a gimmick that send just volunteer to rwanda 
 when we enter government we say it be time for grip not gimmick and that be exactly what we be deliver since july we have establish the border security command head by experienced police chief martin hewitt in the king ’s speech we set out our intention to bring forward legislation to give the border security system strong power to investigate and prosecute organise immigration crime we be recruit new specialist agency and investigation officer at the national crime agency to target and dismantle the criminal network behind this phenomenon we have also announce an extra £ to bolster border security bring our investment in the border security command over the next year to £ this government ’s border security funding boost will go towards a range of enforcement and intelligence activity and capability include covert technology as well as hundred of staff and specialist investigator as we crank up the pressure on the smuggling gang 
 this be an international problem require international solution since the general election we have intensify co operation with partner overseas we recently strike a new anti smuggling action plan with g7 partner and the prime minister and home secretary both attend the interpol general assembly in glasgow on monday to press the case for a much strong and more integrated global response to organise immigration crime 
 as well as tackle the issue upstream we have take action to speed up decision making and step up return of those with no right to be in this country the result of all this action be return since this government take office include a increase in enforce return and a increase in return of foreign national offender 
 stick plaster and gimmick have fail the smuggler and trafficker have be get away with it for far too long it be time to show they we be serious not with word but with action the security of britain ’s border be paramount and under this government it always will be 
 i call the shadow leader of the house chris philp 
 shadow home secretary thank you mr speaker 
 i be afraid the government ’s action belie the reality since they come to office people have cross the english channel more than twice the number they have remove that be and a half time the number in the previous month and more than the same period last year in october alone last month people cross time high than in last october tragically since this government come to office people have lose their life or go missing more than in the previous month put together and tragically that include woman and child 
 this government decide they choose to cancel the rwanda scheme before it have even start the flight be due to take off from memory on   july   but they cancel it have they allow that to go ahead and the scheme to continue the deterrent effect would by now have start we know it work because it work in australia under its operation sovereign borders about year ago we know the deterrent effect of return work it work with albania where we secure a reduction in arrival do not just take my word for it the national crime agency say that law enforcement alone be not enough and we need an effective removal scheme to deter crossing the government ’s announcement in glasgow on monday be simply not enough and they repeat work that be under way already the nca and i be not the only one say that we need a return deterrent just a few week ago european commission president ursula von der leyen encourage member state to develop their own return hub outside the european union will the minister follow ursula von der leyen ’s advice and urgently implement offshore processing 
 may i also draw attention to the success that belgium have have in stop boat by the shore will the minister ask france to do the same finally because of their failing labour be break their manifesto pledge to end hotel use so will she pledge not to open any more hotel 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman the shadow home secretary to his new front bench position what a pleasure it be to be opposite he i be go to look forward to joust with he over the year 
 on the rwanda scheme during the period from when it begin to when we scrap it people cross in small boat if that be a deterrent the right hon gentleman have a peculiar view of the meaning of deterrence in the english language 
 when i realise that we be do this urgent question i take the opportunity to look at the right hon gentleman ’s record as a home office minister during his stint at the home office from september to 2021—23,849 people cross the channel on small boat during his ministerial sojourn at the home office people cross the channel in small boat so his overall total be in september the shadow home secretary answer an urgent question he say that the last government would 
 not rest until we have take the necessary step to completely end these crossing ”—[official report   september vol c. 
 how do that go 
 in cross the channel since then more than have cross the majority of they on the conservatives watch all they could introduce be ridiculous gimmick such as rwanda which cost taxpayer million of pound do the minister agree that the new injection of cash into border security command be a well use of taxpayer money than the gimmick that the conservatives introduce 
 yes i agree wholeheartedly the issue here be deal with cross border organise immigration crime to do that we have to talk to our international ally and co operate with they across border that be exactly what the creation of the border security command will do both operationally and politically and we will see the result 
 we now come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i join the minister in welcome the new shadow home secretary to his place lead with the chin on the full day in the job be an interesting approach but if any situation highlight the manifest failing of the last conservative government it be surely this we in this house all want to stop the dangerous channel crossing i be afraid that the last government totally fail at that so i be surprised we be discuss it today the asylum backlog balloon under the tories the human being we be talk about who be in these small boat be often the victim of smuggling and traffic gang that profit from human suffering do the minister agree that it be therefore imperative that we work in close co ordination than ever before with europol and our french counterpart to smash these criminal network i urge the government to address the root cause of the problem not just the symptom we must empower the foreign commonwealth and development office to provide robust aid to region in an increasingly unstable world 
 the hon lady be exactly right this be not about gimmick or have a parallel immigration policy that be unconnected with any of the treaty we have sign or international law it be about do the day job and make sure not to leave an inheritor government a person backlog by not do the day job the issue with small boat crossing be deal with organise internationally focus immigration crime which often originate in country very far away to tackle this issue we have to co operate with the force of law and order operationally across border and that be what this government be determined to do 
 may i welcome the government ’s approach on this issue and the increase in enforce removal since last summer i agree with the minister that the way to deal with this issue be to smash the criminal gang i urge she to consider what attention she give to the shadow home secretary who when he be a home office minister impose hotel on my constituency and be the chief secretary to the treasury for liz truss during the mini budget 
 the shadow home secretary ’s record in office be a matter that we may well keep come back to i agree with the observation that my hon friend make 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 everybody in this house want an end to small boat crossing and the risk that people take to cross the channel the minister have announce a number of measure this week when do she expect those measure to start produce a reduction in crossing will she commit to keep the select committee inform on progress 
 it be my chance to congratulate the right hon lady on her election as chair of the select committee i look forward to come before her committee whenever she wish to talk to i the department certainly wish to keep she informed about what be go on 
 there have be a significant shift in international co operation what with the g7 collaboration on smuggling and the dialogue of the european political community of which there be a meeting tomorrow at which we hope there will be some announcement the government have also be work on bilateral memorandum of understanding and action plan across europe to achieve a step change in cross border co operation which be the key to beginning to tackle the awful criminal smuggling activity 
 in the year before the election i work on prevent human trafficking in scotland include with many of the victim who come on small boat crossing they have go through the most appalling abuse that chill the soul do the minister agree that public money be far well spend on smash the gang and free the victim than on a rwanda plan that be never go to work 
 yes i agree profoundly with my hon friend which be why the new government have change tack in this area i be sure that we will see the result in due course 
 the government have pledge million of pound to smash the gang on top of the million of pound that we spend on stop the boat the government have pledge more drone on the channel and to fast track case just as we deploy drone on the channel and fast track case the government have set up a border security command which sound remarkably similar to the small boat operational command that we set up when in government other than scrap the thing that would have work that is the deterrent what have this government do that be different that be actually go to stop the boat 
 the border security command be operationally completely different from the command on the channel which be deliberately there to try to save life and find out what be go on on the water operationally the border security command will co operate across border in a very different way if i be the right hon and learn lady i would not be boast about the colossal morass of waste expenditure that the rwanda scheme represented—£700 down the drain with plan to spend nearly £ on the plan over the next few year it be a gross waste of money that do not deter a single boat crossing 
 the gang that run this vile trade care only for their profit not for the life that they put at risk will the minister reassure the house and my constituent in east thanet that the border security command will do everything to break the evil smuggling gang and bring the ringleader to justice 
 yes the point of the increase in operational co operation across border be that if we can not bring people to justice in our jurisdiction we can ensure that information be swap in real time so that they can be bring to justice in other jurisdiction there will be a step change in that kind of international co operation which will deliver result 
 will the minister describe clearly and unambiguously without bluster the difference in function between the border security command and the small boat operational command 
 the border security command be not focus only on channel crossing it be much more about use our intelligence capability and our operational arm to co operate across border with other jurisdiction and in real time to ensure that organise criminal gang can be track apprehend and dismantle we have give £ extra to the border security command to start to do that work the command on the channel be about save life and co operate with the french once people have reach the beach it be far too late once people have reach the beach we need to go far back to the origin country and do a lot more work there 
 will the minister acknowledge the real concern feel by people in the uk and in my city of portsmouth about the small boat crossing do she agree that the increase since last summer in enforce return of people who have no right to be here show what can be do when grown up be in the room and when a government focus on get a grip 
 i absolutely agree with the point my hon friend make 
 there be conflict globally which along with other factor such as poverty food insecurity and the effect of climate change cause population to move do the minister agree that as my hon friend   the member for hazel grove lisa smart   point out it be essential that we look at the root cause of immigration do she therefore support an increase in the development and aid budget rather than the cut in official development assistance in last week ’s budget 
 in the end any work that we can do upstream whether in respect of development or aid will deal with some of the cause some of which the hon lady rightly point out we have to stay within the bound set by the budget but i assure she that i regard prevention as much well than cure 
 this government inherit a situation on our border in which there be failure on all front there be record number of tragic death in the channel million waste on the fail   rwanda gimmick and criminal gang profiteer off exploit our border will the minister reassure my constituent that unlike the previous government we will not waste time on political gimmick but will focus on the practical measure that can bring an end to the persistence of these damn failure 
 i assure my hon friend that we will do exactly that it be why we have see a step change in return since this government take office there have be in that period which include a increase in enforce return and a increase in return of foreign national offender we will ensure that our immigration system have integrity 
 sometimes when listen to the exchange between labour front benchers and the conservatives we can forget that we be deal with real people who be flee the most unimaginable horror aside from the bizarre rwanda plan why be the minister continue with the same fail approach as the tories the government continue to spend million on hotel drone and various bit of high tech how about try something different how about look at safe and legal route in order to smash the gang and how about show some compassion 
 i be not go to get into a competition with the hon gentleman about compassion we have a duty to ensure that asylum seeker who come to our shore be properly process and deal with and integrate in our society if asylum be grant interruption despite the hon gentleman chuntere away i be not go to stand here and say that we will let people smuggler who exploit people for money decide who come to our country we have to stop this trade that be not at odd with treat those who arrive here with compassion 
 when i stand for election on   july   this year my commitment to my voter be that we would smash the criminal gang and stop the small boat at that point the number of small boat crossing be high than in the bad ever year do the minister welcome the datum that show that the number be now low than in 
 yes but the house have to have patience there be no magic wand to wave in this policy area and there be no fantasy policy now that we have get rid of the rwanda scheme there be hard day to day operational work to try to get the system that we inherit which be in complete chaos with huge backlog back into some kind of order so that we can run it properly fairly and efficiently that be what we be focus on 
 i recently listen to an interview with a retire former inspector of border and immigration who be respond to the government ’s announcement he outline his concern about the impact of the measure on their own without an effective deterrent and about how the government will measure their success the percentage or volume by which they want to see small boat crossing reduce after the announcement what percentage reduction in small boat crossing would the government view as success 
 i be not get into a number game in the house we be try to deal with and dismantle a trade that be allow to become establish and industrialise on the previous government ’s watch i be not go to stand here and say it ’ll happen overnight but we will make progress 
 folk in plymouth be really interested in how the government will solve this big problem they will welcome the increase in money towards deal with the problem and the increase in return another thing they want be constructive lively debate with idea in this place unfortunately the opposition seem so devoid of idea that they will bang on for another year about their landmark rwanda policy to stop the boat a fail scheme that get firmly reject by the electorate do the minister agree that the sign of insanity be try the same thing over and over again and expect a different result 
 yes 
 in the home office annual report it be confirm that in £ be spend on hotel cost for illegal migrant average £ a day the cruel inheritance tax assault on british family farm and business be estimate eventually to raise £ a year do the labour government need to rethink their spending priority urgently 
 no we have just have a budget which we be in the middle of debate and will be vote on and i expect that that will be the way we go forwards 
 the increase in return of people who have no right to be here be a really positive step in give the public confidence in our system what measure be in place to continue to ensure that our process remain robust and that the trajectory of return continue 
 we be ensure that the enforcement part of the home office that deal with return be give the resource it need to do that job but to make it even more successful we have to engage with those country to which we wish to return people so that we can have paper issue again the significant shift in international co operation be what will deliver that 
 if rwanda be a gimmick why be germany austria bulgaria cyprus the netherlands poland and romania look at similar scheme give the number of crossing and death in the channel would it not with hindsight have be wise at least to have allow the rwanda scheme a trial run 
 those country be not consider a rwanda scheme they be all say that they will stay within the confine of international law the rwanda scheme definitely tear up international law and it be plan to spend nearly £ up until on try to remove people a week from this country   and to spend nearly £ on extra detention camp for they in this country i do not think that represent british value or good value for money 
 give that only of people who arrive by small boat between and june have be return a period of reflection from the conservative party on this issue would be welcome do the minister agree that a government who have dispense with gimmick and who focus on the day job be deliver that progress on return 
 yes but let we not underestimate the fact that under the illegal migration act nobody who arrive in that way could be process so people be wait to be process because the previous government stop the system dead we have to get the processing system go again that be what we be do so that we can get the flow of decision return those who be not entitle to be here and integrate those who be entitle to stay 
 the government have a mandate for try out their approach and i wish they well i have always feel that unless the boat be intercept and turn back near the start of their journey nothing will deter people from use that method will the minister whom i respect greatly explain how it be possible to smash gang who operate in other jurisdiction once they get to the point where they withdraw their headquarters to country where there be no possibility of co operation with the authority in charge of those state 
 well get to that level of withdrawal would be a fantastic development that would put incredible pressure on many of the supply line currently be use if we could get to that stage we would have already make significant progress the answer to what the right hon gentleman be talk about be international co operation to put the maximum pressure on this terrible international trade in human life and exploitation i be glad that he be give i a little bit of time to prove that we can make a difference 
 people in west brom be appal by these criminal smuggling gang do the minister agree that the last government waste £ on the totally fail rwanda scheme could she set out how the new government be go to fix the situation 
 yes and the repurposing of some of that money and resource that have not be lose be fund the new approach 
 do the minister agree that the loss of life be colossally too high on these channel crossing include the loss of a year old child just the other week do she also agree that we should reopen safe route so that we can treat those come to this country with the dignity and respect that they deserve 
 i do not believe that safe route would stop people from attempt to come over the channel in small boat i have some sympathy with the idea of safe route but i do not think they would stop   this trade for example indians come across and we have a visa regime with the indians the high nationality for small boat arrival this year be the vietnamese again it be not always about people who be asylum seeker come over it be people who do not have a right to be here but be pay to come here safe route would not solve that problem 
 the shadow home secretary refer to the life lose in the channel every single of they be a tragedy but do the minister agree that his try to make a political point about those death as he appear to do be beneath the conservative party as be gimmick such as the rwanda scheme 
 yes i agree the loss of life in the channel this year have be the high on record and that be because more pressure be be put on the gang the boat be be overload and there be more anarchy on the beach in france those be all thing that we have to try to deal with in co operation with our french colleague 
 my constituent want to see an end to the small boat crossing and an end to the use of hotel for asylum seeker as pledge in the government ’s manifesto will the minister undertake to ensure that where hotel have see asylum seeker move out more be not put back in 
 the issue with hotel and other dispersal accommodation be that we have inherit a backlog owe to the way in which the conservatives run the system there be no processing of asylum seeker who then have to be put up in hotel hotel be temporary not a solution we will do our good to get out of deal with hotel as quickly as possible by get the system up and run and process those who be make claim so that we can get they either approve and integrate or return 
 the government come to power this year in the bad year on record for small boat crossing which be high than in the previous record year of that be the legacy of chaos leave by the last government there be no room for complacency but do the minister agree that we should be welcome the now low level of small boat crossing this year compare with 
 i agree that the month of this year be the bad on record there be then a quiet month and now there have be a huge increase not least because of benign weather condition i do not want to get into monthly figure we need to bear down on the organise criminality that be perpetrate the trade to disrupt it and deal with it that way 
 do the minister recognise the distinct lack of humanity about this urgent question and the discussion surround small boat and migration do she not recognise that those people who risk all to get into those very dangerous boat and cross the chancel be do so in an act of desperation the lack of a safe route system across   europe have create a market for people trafficker instead of the current approach do she not think it necessary to look seriously at safe route for asylum seeker to avoid the tragedy of all these death in the channel and for that matter in the mediterranean 
 i say early that safe route would not stop all the channel crossing there be now an industrialise system run by organise immigration criminal the vietnamese would never have a safe route into the uk there be no visa system yet they now comprise of the people cross on small boat with all due respect to the right hon gentleman i do not think that safe route would solve the problem
