to give a sense of quantum to the house about £ worth of uk steel export go to the united states that represent if i recollect accurately about of uk production so the hon gentleman be entirely right to recognise that this be a significant moment we take that very seriously which be why we be engage in dialogue with both the workforce and the owner of the various steel producer here in the united kingdom more broadly as my right hon friend   the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne   allude to we want to avoid a significant escalation we see retaliatory measure take under the trump administration it feel to i that this be an opportunity for the uk to exercise a cool head and a clear eyed sense of where the national interest lie these tariff will not be impose until   march which give we time to undertake the dialogue that be already under way to reach a judgment on the basis of the analysis that we have already do and to ensure that our interlocuter in washington and elsewhere be engage in a constructive and mature dialogue 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he have take to improve access to patient care for people with parkinson ’s disease in newcastle under lyme constituency 
 i welcome the minister to her place 
 i thank my hon friend for his continued support for people with parkinson ’s disease a condition that i know be close to his family this government inherit long wait for neurology service with only of patient include those with parkinson ’s wait less than week for a referral in june our elective reform plan will free up over appointment each year for those who really need they include patient with parkinson ’s and nhs england ’s get it right time programme continue to work with specialise centre in england include at university hospitals of north midlands 
 i thank the minister for her answer and congratulate she on her appointment will she join i in pay tribute to my constituent julie hibbs from bradwell in newcastle under lyme who have long campaign for support for people with parkinson ’s like she will the minister meet i and julie to discuss the merit of add parkinson ’s to the medical exemption list and to discuss how we ensure that those with parkinson ’s get the support they need and deserve 
 i be happy to meet my hon friend and his constituent to discuss all of those matter of concern i look forward to do so as soon as my diary will allow 
 the eye be not only the window to the soul but a window to our health last week i have the pleasure of meet the team at moorfields eye hospital who alongside a team at university college london have do some work on a simple retinal scan that can detect parkinson ’s disease year prior to any symptom do the minister agree that optometry eye care and eye health should be at the forefront of nhs england ’s plan for integrated care and that we should bring forward a national eye health strategy 
 yes i would be more than happy to support that that be part and parcel of this government ’s aim to shift the nhs from hospital to community 
 what step his department be take to improve access to mental health service 
 after year of tory neglect and incompetence we inherit a broken nhs and nowhere be that more apparent than in our mental health service too many people be wait too long to access the care they need to fix that we will recruit more mental health worker provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school as the hon member have call for roll out young futures hub in community and modernise the mental health act 
 with the terminally ill adult end of life bill be amend to include a panel that will involve psychiatrist who will determine whether a request for assist dying should be grant as well as a number of cross party amendment rightly call for the involvement of mental health professional early in the process what assessment have ministers make of whether there be sufficient capacity in mental health service which the minister have just note be overstretch to meet those demand and on the potential knock on impact on both wait time and treatment for those with mental health condition 
 the hon lady will know that the government ’s position on the terminally ill adult end of life bill be of neutrality i be on the bill committee simply to speak about the government ’s position on the workability and operationalisation of the bill we look forward to see the amendment that will be bring forward by my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater any comment we make or position we take will be base on the operationalisation of that amendment should it become part of the bill and ultimately should the bill gain royal assent 
 thurrock community hospital do fantastic work on integrated care particularly on integrate mental health care on a visit representative say that what make the hospital successful be a commitment to work across integrate care board the local authority and other relevant partner in the community as well as a commitment to meet people where they be find out what be important for they and work from there do the minister see that model as integral to the reform of mental health care in this country will he join i on a visit to thurrock community hospital to see what it do and what can be learn from how that work be undertake 
 my hon friend be a doughty campaigner on this issue in her constituency she be right that the integration of service be crucial to ensure that we get the good possible outcome for people who be struggle with their mental health i would be very happy to discuss with she the possibility of i visit her constituency 
 be the minister aware of the brilliant work do by mersey care nhs foundation trust in reduce in patient mental health suicide to which be an extraordinary achievement under a former health secretary who may be stand not a mile away from where i be stand now that become an objective for all mental health in patient unit across the nhs will the minister look into whether that objective still stand if not can it be reinstate 
 i be not familiar with the detail of the case that the right hon gentleman mention but it sound like a positive and interesting development and i would be happy to consider it far the government be commit to deliver the cross sector suicide prevention strategy for england publish in the new mental health worker who we will recruit will be specially train to support people at risk 
 i be regularly contact by constituent who be concerned that their child be not receive the mental health care they need have meet gps in winsford i know that there be clear concern that access to child and adolescent mental health service be be ration to the point that it have become almost inaccessible to all but the most severe case will my hon friend tell i what progress have be make towards our commitment to provide specialist mental health professional in school ensure that there be early intervention that prevent issue from escalate 
 after the disastrous year that we have have we be face a very serious situation in term of mental health provision it will take some time to get the workforce in place but we have a clear commitment to have a specialist in every school the appointment and training of those specialist will take some time we be also roll out open access young futures hub in every community i be confident that the combination of those intervention will get we back to have mental health service that this country can be truly proud of 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 i welcome the under secretary of state for health and social care   the hon member for west lancashire ashley dalton to her place i look forward to work with she as i do with other ministers 
 as the minister for care will know of the burden on the nhs be due to mental health yet only of the budget be allocate towards it the mental health investment standard have be a welcome maintenance under this government however the select committee hear from amanda pritchard the other day that the standard be guarantee for only the next year do the minister agree that the standard have have a positive effect on mental health community service and would he commit to protect it 
 the chair of the committee will have see that we have make an explicit commitment to the mental health investment standard we be absolutely   committed to that in addition we have to drive reform in the system so that it be about not just the amount of investment go in but how we ensure that it be work properly i be absolutely confident that the commitment to new specialist the young futures hub and have a mental health specialist in every school will facilitate the delivery of service in a far more effective way than be currently the case 
 i thank the minister for his continue commitment to support mental health in this country do he also recognise that mental health involve support nhs frontline staff i have the wonderful opportunity of spend time with the east of england ambulance service on saturday morning they work incredibly long hour and work incredibly hard obviously we need to think about their mental health as well 
 we in this chamber should whenever possible pay tribute to the people provide those frontline service who every day work heroically in very difficult circumstance my hon friend be absolutely right about the pressure on the workforce we be very conscious of that we will bring forward a workforce plan in the summer and we be work at pace to recruit the mental health worker 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 last week the secretary of state issue a new mandate for the nhs in which a number of mental health target be drop i accept that target that drive perverse behaviour should be drop and that some sharpen focus be necessary but mental health waiting list be at a record high huge number of people be not at work because of poor mental health and our young people be be let down badly by camhs not least in my constituency of north shropshire do the secretary of state accept that mental health target should be reinstate and that mental health should be treat with equal priority to physical health 
 what we know about target be that if we try to overload a system with too many target it cause confusion and end up with as the hon lady rightly say perverse outcome we be clear that we do not want to have a system base on just make policy by press release as be the case under the previous government put out press announcement about load more target it all make for nice front page headline but it do not lead to any serious delivery of the strategy that we need to deliver i be with she on the point about focus we be absolutely committed to mental health as be set out in the planning guidance it be also of the priority in the planning guidance and we will continue to deliver on that priority 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs on the uk ’s leadership on global health and immunisation 
 uk leadership on global health be critical to safeguard our national and international health security build resilience and create prosperity i work closely with my counterpart across government i recently meet the foreign secretary to discuss these issue which be also high on the agenda of the minister for development the uk have of the large vaccination programme in the world and our confidence and uptake rate be among the high globally 
 the nhs and the uk reap the benefit of our work in global health gavi be of the uk ’s great success story it have inoculate child worldwide but it have also strengthen our health security keep we safe from disease such as mpox and ebola what leadership will the secretary of state and his department take to strengthen organisation such as gavi to keep we safe here in the uk 
 the hon member raise an important point i know that my ministerial colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office be look at the investment case for gavi and the global fund as part of the spending review i will ensure that her representation be relay to the fcdo and she be very welcome to make those point during oral question to that department 
 i call the shadow minister 
 there be almost case of serious antimicrobial resistant infection in the united kingdom in war be increase such infection globally of patient in kyiv hospital in ukraine be say to have such infection the conservative government have a plan to tackle that do the labour government plan to follow that plan be they on track to meet those target and if not what will the secretary of state do about it 
 i be delighted that dame sally davies continue her work on antimicrobial resistance that be an absolutely critical issue and i pay tribute to the previous government particularly minister quince for their work on it it be in the national interest that we maintain not just the national focus but the international focus on antimicrobial resistance which be why uk leadership in those global fora be so important 
 another time when it be important to work together be during a pandemic such as by share research unfortunately recent history tell we that when labour negotiate britain lose out can the secretary of state confirm that whatever emerge from discussion with the world health organisation he will not reduce the uk ’s capacity to take decision in the interest of the british people 
 may i just say how regrettable it be that a sensible shadow minister be send along to parrot the absurd line of her leader 
 if he will take step to repair hinchingbrooke hospital before building contain reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete reach the end of their lifespan in 
 as i be sure the hon member know hinchingbrooke hospital be in wave of the new hospital programme and his constituent can now look forward to a new hospital under this labour government the hospital have receive over £ to deliver raac mitigation safety work and my right hon friend the secretary of state have commission a site by site survey of raac hospital which will ensure that individual development plan address the high risk element as soon as possible 
 last july deborah lee the senior responsible officer for the hinchingbrooke hospital redevelopment programme state that the deadline for the new hospital be in a write answer to i last year the minister confirm that even after the mitigation measure of failsafe steelwork the lifespan of the remain raac building would run only until approximately can the secretary of state confirm that the rebuild and all wave of the new hospital programme will not be delay by the review of build safety regulation guidance announce by the deputy prime minister in december will he assure my constituent that the raac building at hinchingbrooke will be safe to use beyond and if so will he publish the risk assessment that he have conduct to confirm that 
 the hon gentleman have outline the shocking state of some hospital i confirm again that we want a site by site report of those hospital for exactly that purpose to ensure that they be safe and to understand any critical issue before the scheme go forward we expect that report in the summer 
 give that the tory predecessor of   the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty   fail to mention raac once and mention hinchingbrooke hospital only time in year do the minister agree that people in huntingdon and across the country need a labour government commit to rebuild the nhs not a tory government who pay lip service but fail to back it up 
 i commend my hon friend on his research into the previous government and for the hard work that he be do on behalf of his constituent we be committed to the rebuild of hinchingbrooke and have put the new hospital programme on a sustainable footing which be something that his constituent can look forward to 
 what progress his department be make in reduce waiting time for elective care 
 this government inherit a waiting list with a staggering people on it since july that waiting list have already be reduce by almost and ensure that the nhs once again meet the week standard for elective treatment be at the heart of the government ’s plan for change our elective reform plan set out how we will meet that standard by the end of this parliament through a combination of investment and reform that labour know from past experience deliver result 
 i get regular message from constituent face terrible wait for care with potentially serious consequence include a year delay for an early dementia referral and an month delay for a cardiology review although i understand the case for the short term off use of spare private capacity to tackle the backlog while the nhs be rebuild can the secretary of state please outline his long term thinking regard privatisation of the national health service in particular why be he encourage the development of long term relationship with the private sector 
 the nhs have always work constructively with the independent sector and i do not believe that ideological hobby horse should come before patient get fast access to care this government be invest in our nhs and before the hon lady complain about that i would just point out that the green party ’s manifesto on the nhs say that it would require an 
 additional annual expenditure of £ 8bn in the full year 
 of this parliament rise to £ later the chancellor have just deliver a budget that deliver £ of additional investment and the greens complain about it 
 i welcome the new minister my hon friend   the member for west lancashire ashley dalton to her place hundred of my constituent be on waiting list for knee and hip operation and while   the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns   say that she would like to see those waiting list reduce the green party have do everything it can to oppose labour ’s plan for change it oppose our budget with its record investment in the nhs and it oppose our agreement with the independent sector to bring down the backlog do the secretary of state agree that it be time for the opposition party to stop wish for a reduction in waiting list and start back labour ’s credible plan to make a real difference 
 i wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend as we know from the greens experience in local government they can not clear the bin let alone the waiting list 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the labour government ’s elective reform plan say that there be plan for straight to test pathway can the secretary of state name they or give example 
 it be absolutely ridiculous mr speaker conservative members turn up criticise and carp about this government ’s elective reform plan but i remind the hon gentleman that when his party be in office it deliver the long waiting list in the history of the nhs if he want to do a pop quiz he can use google 
 this be the secretary of state ’s own plan there be example in the plan but as an article in the bmj on   january   helpfully point out that example which feature sarah who have sinus pain and hearing issue be quietly remove from all online and future draft after 
 a flurry of gps point out that her treatment 
 be wholly inappropriate that article go on to say that 
 sarah can pick up her dose of unnecessary radiation along with her weekly shop 
 on this part of the government ’s plan the bmj conclude 
 sarah ’s story be of over investigation fragmented and inappropriate care spurious choice and a lack of senior decision making at presentation activity for activity ’s sake have little to do with high quality care 
 do the secretary of state agree with the bmj and if not why not 
 i always believe in hold our hand up when mistake be make i be happy to say that the reason that case study be remove from the publish elective reform plan be because it be a genuine mistake for which i accept responsibility as the secretary of state now maybe the conservative party might like to accept responsibility for the high waiting list and low patient satisfaction in history and finally have the decency to apologise to the country for the mess it leave we in 
 what step his department be take to support hospice 
 what step his department be take to support hospice 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of long term funding for hospice 
 hospices provide vital care and support for patient and their family at the most difficult time i be very proud that this government have provide a £ capital funding boost for adult and child ’s hospice over this year and next we be currently finalise the delivery mechanism for this funding and we be pleased that hospice uk be stand ready to distribute the money to local hospice across england we be also provide £ of revenue funding for child ’s hospice in england in 
 while i wholeheartedly welcome the £ capital funding boost for hospice announce before christmas member of staff at nottinghamshire hospice which be a large community base hospice serve my constituency that provide care for family member in their own home have recently be tell they be at risk of redundancy can the minister please expand on how the government will support organisation such as this to continue to deliver excellent care in the community 
 i thank my hon friend for this important question and i commend the work of hospice such as nottinghamshire hospice in his constituency which i know do a wonderful job for people in his area the investment i refer to in my early answer will help hospice such as nottinghamshire hospice to provide quality end of life care to patient and their family this year and next it can be use to improve it system make it easy for gps and hospital to share   vital datum on patient and help to develop and improve outreach service to support people in their own home when need 
 north london hospice in my constituency have a site in winchmore hill that receive of its funding from the nhs with the rest come from the generosity of the public many of its service such as out patient and wellbeing be fund entirely by donation while it welcome the announcement of the £ in funding what assurance can the government provide about long term hospice funding give the significant delay in access funding from integrated care board this year hospice be anxious to seek clarity about the allocation and distribution of this funding 
 i thank my hon friend for that question on her point about long term funding last week i chair a roundtable with key stakeholder from the sector and we be absolutely focused on develop a plan to secure the long term sustainability of the sector we can not go back to the cliff edge that we have have over the last few month primarily due to the utterly chaotic and shambolic way in which the conservative party manage our system in the past 
 i have have the privilege of witness at hand the exceptional work of my local hospice forget i not child ’s hospice and the kirkwood however as my hon friend the members for rushcliffe james naish and for edmonton and winchmore hill kate osamor have state they be also struggle with long term funding pressure and have have to make the difficult decision to reduce service and staff what further work be the government do to ensure that hospice thrive and to ensure that end of life care be include in the year nhs plan 
 i thank my hon friend for that question of the shift that the year plan will deliver be shift more healthcare out of hospital and into the community in the context of the plan we be have discussion about the long term sustainability of the palliative and end of life care sector include hospice as we develop the plan we will be carefully consider policy in this area with input from the public patient health staff and our stakeholder as i mention in response to my hon friend   the member for edmonton and winchmore hill kate osamor last week i be pleased to chair a roundtable to discuss long term strategy for hospice to get palliative and end of life care include hospice on to a more sustainable footing after year of tory neglect and incompetence 
 leicestershire be home to some superb hospice such as rainbow and loros both of which be set to be massively impact by the hike in national insurance contribution give the important work that these hospice do particularly for people at the end of their life will the minister urge the chancellor to reverse this pernicious tax rise 
 i be once again strike by the fact that conservative members seem to welcome the additional investment that the chancellor have put into our health   and care service but do not seem to have any plan or proposal at all about how the revenue should be generate for that funding until we get an answer to that question we will struggle to get much far in this house although i note that toby porter the chief executive of hospice uk have say that the 
 funding will allow hospice to continue to reach hundred of thousand of people every year with high quality compassionate care we look forward to work with the government to make sure everyone approach the end of life get the care and support they need 
 may i pay tribute to those who work in hospice i think we can all agree that they do an astonishing job the minister will agree that the national insurance hike have have an impact on those who work in hospice can he assure i that when it come to the scottish government ’s funding i acknowledge the year of tory misrule and the funding settlement that be hand down any barnett consequential will be pass on in full to the devolved administration 
 we have see the big settlement in many year for our health and care system across the country it be now up to the snp government in edinburgh to absorb and deliver that funding in a way that will actually improve service in scotland something that we have not see for a very long time under the misrule of the scottish national party 
 the magnificent work do by those who work in hospice include the in northern ireland need to be reflect in the funding formula will the minister undertake to discuss with ministerial colleague the need for the treasury to review that funding formula particularly in relation to devolve settlement 
 from the roundtable discussion and from subsequent discussion we have be have with the sector it be clear that we need to look at the long term funding issue we face a cliff edge towards the end of last year that be not the right way to do thing we must start get the funding discussion move so that well in advance of the end of this financial year the funding situation for the palliative and hospice sector be much clear 
 what step he be take to reduce inequality in healthcare 
 lord darzi ’s report lay bare the shocking health inequality in our country it be completely unacceptable that in britain in maternal mortality rate for black woman be more than double those of white woman and life expectancy at birth for female in blackpool be year less than in kensington and chelsea reduce inequality in elective care be identify as a key priority in the planning guidance and mandate that the nhs publish last month and further measure to address these inequality in our country will be at the heart of our year health plan which will be publish in the spring 
 in the then coalition government reduce the health inequality weight in the nhs formula with the result that less money go to deprive area that be despite evidence that between and every £ invest in such area result in few man and few woman die early can my hon friend reassure government members that that health inequality weighting will be reinstate so that we can ensure that deprived area get the funding they need and that life be save 
 the government mandate to nhs england be publish on   january   and make the importance of tackle health inequality clear nhs england have an exist programme that target the most deprived of the population with the aim of reduce health inequality i can reassure my hon friend who have be a determined campaigner on inequality that the health inequality weighting have not be withdraw the funding in question which amount to £ have be incorporate into the main integrate care board allocation the weighting of that health inequality adjustment have be increase from to so that the icb still benefit from that extra investment with funding redistribute to area with the poor health outcome base on measure of avoidable mortality provide by the office for national statistics 
 i welcome the hon lady to her position she may be unaware of the number of debate that i have lead into woman ’s health and endometriosis and pelvic mesh and there be an inequality in the health service with how woman be treat many woman be deeply concerned by the announcement and statement about how the concentration on woman ’s health have be reduce will the minister speak to the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologist follow that meeting will she speak to the secretary of state who rightly say that he recognise when mistake have be make about reconsider the approach to woman ’s health take in the statement the other week 
 the darzi review highlight that there be too many target set for the nhs which make it hard for local system to prioritise action there have be no reduction in woman ’s health service the government be commit to prioritise woman ’s health as we build an nhs that be fit for the future and woman ’s equality will be at the heart of our mission woman ’s health hub which provide integrate woman ’s health service in the community have a key role in tackle the inequality face by woman the department have invest £ over and to support the establishment of at least pilot woman ’s health hub in every integrate care system 
 whether he have have discussion with nhs england on include vasa praevia screening as part of antenatal care 
 i thank my hon friend for his ongoing work in raise awareness in maternity service we be committed to improve   maternity care for woman and baby evidence do not currently support screening for vasa praevia in the uk but we have ask the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists to review the guidance around this issue 
 my constituent cate maddison suffer with severe vasa praevia in childbirth this condition cause severe bleeding and can often result in the death of infant in childbirth and complication for the mother however the risk be significantly reduce when identify during pregnancy thankfully cate ’s child survive but she be campaign to reduce unnecessary complication and death arise from the condition will the minister meet i and cate to discuss how we can tackle this important issue 
 i be incredibly sorry to hear about cate ’s experience we want to ensure that woman receive safe personalised and compassionate maternity care and that woman with the condition be support that be why we have ask the college to look at the guidance i will of course be happy to meet my hon friend and his constituent 
 there be clearly a need to consider vasa praevia as part of antenatal care   the hon member for crewe and nantwich connor naismith   set the scene very well and the minister respond in a good fashion this issue which the hon member be right to highlight be also an issue in northern ireland will the minister share what be go forward here with representative at the northern ireland assembly 
 i thank the hon member for that point as he know i be always keen to ensure we share good practice across the united kingdom so that his constituent like mine can benefit we will work through the usual process to ensure that happen 
 if he will provide funding for the repair of stepping hill hospital in stockport 
 i thank the hon lady along with my hon friend   the member for stockport navendu mishra for her continued support for stepping hill hospital i know that she be work hard on this issue we be back the nhs with over £ of funding for integrate care board for capital priority with a dedicated £ estate safety fund next year to address the poor quality hospital i be pleased that the replacement of stepping hill ’s outpatient facility be already under way back by £ this year i look forward to visit as soon as my diary allow 
 i be grateful to the minister for her response and our ongoing correspondence on this issue i very much look forward to meet she on site at stepping hill so that she can see for herself the report £ repair backlog at the site the most recent board paper mention a £ significant risk backlog which be have a detrimental effect on the hospital team ’s ability to see and treat patient what    hope can the minister give that there be a plan for the funding of building at stepping hill so that my constituent get the treatment that they deserve 
 the hon lady outline for her constituent what many across the house will recognise the state that the last government leave the capital estate in the autumn budget commit over £ into next year with £ for icb to start prioritise some of this work we have allocate £ for critical backlog maintenance and upgrade a long term capital plan will follow the year plan that we be currently develop to offer the hope for her constituent that she ask for 
 what step his department be take with cabinet colleague to increase access to assessment for special educational need 
 child and young people with special educational need be wait too long for the nhs service that they need in large part because local authority have be hollow out by year of austerity we be support early intervention through the partnership for inclusion of neurodiversity in school pin programme which be back by £ of funding nhs england have also launch a taskforce to look at how support can be improve for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder we look forward to its report later this year 
 cambridgeshire have some of the low funding in england for gp practice and school give the government ’s focus on growth for the area and the record demand for special educational need and disability and young people ’s mental health service will the minister work with colleague across government to ensure that high growth area no long suffer low than average funding 
 our commitment to improve send condition be universal we be look at this from the point of view of improve provision right across the country i be very pleased that the pins programme be make progress i draw the hon lady ’s attention to the early language support for every child elsec programme in which pathfinder site over year will provide early identification and targeted and universal support for child with speech language and communication need in early year and primary school setting we be work very closely with colleague across the department for education and nhs england on that 
 local authority resource be a big driver of some challenge in the send system but it be clear to anyone work in it that a systemic under prioritisation of child ’s health all too often by local nhs trust be a big contributing factor young people right across my constituency wait for assessment and lacking support be pay the price as part of our year plan to reform the nhs how will we ensure that child ’s health be front and centre again with much more support for people with additional need 
 i be work very closely with colleague in the dfe on how we mainstream send provision more effectively get more rapid education health and care plan and autism diagnosis and on a whole range of issue that require strong cross party work i would be happy to brief my hon friend on that separately 
 what step his department be take to help reach the national dementia diagnosis rate target 
 the dementia diagnosis rate target be not meet for the last year of the conservative government and it decline over the course of the last parliament this government be commit to ensure that at least third of people live with dementia receive a diagnosis the government be invest in dementia research across all area from cause diagnosis and prevention to treatment care and support to help people live with this condition 
 nearly people be live with dementia it be the big cause of death in the country today and by the end of the 2030s that figure be set to rise to early diagnosis be of the good thing we can do to support people live with dementia so will the secretary of state explain why the dementia diagnosis target no long feature in nhs england ’s priority as publish week ago will he commit to reinstate both dementia and the commitment to a diagnosis target in nhs england ’s priority guideline 
 i just restate the government ’s commitment to ensure that at least third of people live with dementia receive a diagnosis our investment and reform agenda will speed up diagnostic across the board under the last government nhs planning guidance be a wish list of fantasy target most of which be never meet as the nhs get bad and bad they pile on more target to make themselves look busy this government be end the micromanagement turn our nhs around and clear up their mess 
 my dad be a gp in hartlepool for over year the secretary of state be kind enough to meet he the last time he be in hartlepool and he have alzheimer ’s every day i think about why we do not spot the sign early enough to get the treatment that he need at an early stage the alzheimer ’s society estimate that only of social care worker have any form of dementia training do the secretary of state agree that it be critical that we up that number and ensure that all social care worker have dementia training to ensure early diagnosis 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question i know how personal this issue be for he i be delighted to meet his father on my visit to hartlepool and wish he very well i take very seriously what my hon friend have say about the importance of workforce training he mention training for health and social care staff which be important but i would argue that the point apply more broadly across our society on   september the department launch the adult social   care learning and development support scheme which allow eligible employer to claim for funding for certain training course and qualification include relevant dementia training for eligible care staff we will continue to keep this under observation and review 
 what step he be take to help tackle career progression inequality in nursing 
 i know that this issue be close to my hon friend ’s heart after his year of service as a nurse in the health service we have to ensure that the nhs be an attractive place for nurse to work and that they can progress we hear directly from staff through our year plan and work closely with the royal college of nursing unison and other trade union through our social partnership forum 
 i must disclose that i work as a mental health nurse in the nhs for the past year and that in my career i progress from nurse to head of nursing 
 recruitment and retention of nursing staff across the health and social care sector be key to deliver an nhs that be fit for the future but the most recent nhs staff workforce survey show that just of staff feel that the health service act fairly when it come to career progression what step will this government take to address this issue and to ensure that our nursing workforce feel value and feel a sense of purpose in their wide work 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that the issue be key and that the result be worry i know how proud my friend and family member be to become nurse and what a great career nursing offer they we have to deliver on the promise of a good career and build on that pride in be a nurse we absolutely recognise that we can not rebuild the nhs without their skill and their high quality critical and compassionate care 
 do the minister believe that the nhs should expect biologically female nursing staff to get change in front of biologically male colleague who identify as female 
 no 
 what step he be take to help devolve administration reduce waiting list 
 i be delighted to work closely with the hon gentleman when he be minister for health for northern ireland and i be delighted to work with his successor i have meet regularly with my counterpart in northern ireland scotland and wales since i take up office the chancellor ’s recent budget mean a massive £ a year boost for the health and social care service thank to the barnett consequential the devolve administration will benefit from a major increase in their budget the big since devolution begin 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer just over a year ago the former health secretary write to counterpart in the devolved administrations to offer patient from wales and scotland who be experience lengthy wait the option of treatment by provider in england the offer be decline as it be see as a political stunt would the secretary of state consider review that offer but this time include northern ireland so that his call to offer the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs can be share across the entire nation

 the hon member be right to raise this serious and important issue we want to ensure that we improve diagnostic access to treatment and research and i can think of no well person to lead the work on this area of the national cancer strategy than my hon friend the minister for secondary care who have live experience and who demonstrate that people can live well with cancer

 i entirely appreciate the frustration and distress cause by medical supply shortage we be work intensively with industry to resolve the hrt supply issue and the problem with the supply of estradot be expect to be resolve by the end of the month meanwhile we have issue a serious shortage protocol to allow community pharmacist to supply alternative brand of the same medicine and those remain available 
 my constituent james from abbots langley write to i on the subject of the chancellor ’s recent talk about push infrastructure project such as the heathrow airport expansion why be the health secretary not push for this infrastructure funding to be spend on the new watford general hospital a project that have cross party support be shovel ready and will save life 
 if the hon member be so committed to that project perhaps he can explain why his party do so little about it in government 
 since april crawley ’s urgent treatment centre have be temporarily close overnight because of low staffing level what do the government intend to do to ensure that normal service be resume for community such as mine 
 we be absolutely committed to urgent treatment centre which play a vital role in support patient especially during period of high demand i understand that this be temporary and that the centre be run a pilot i know that my hon friend will work closely with his local integrate care board to ensure that it serve his constituency adequately 
 there be people in the united kingdom live with parkinson ’s and in will be diagnose during their lifetime there be new case every year of they in northern ireland do the secretary of state agree that it be time we have a parkinson ’s charity not just for england but for scotland wales and northern ireland as well as i always say let we do it well together 
 where have i hear that before the hon member know that i will agree with he on the matter of the union but i also believe that we should work cross border wherever we can especially when it come to important issue such as parkinson ’s we have to make well breakthrough in research treatment and hopefully find a cure 
 after year of conservative government of people in derby can not access an nhs dentist can the minister tell we what cause the rot to set in and how we can fill the cavity in provision 
 i see what my hon friend do there and she should brace herself as we drill down into this answer the conservative    party be the cause of the rot spending on nhs dentistry fall by a staggering between and so it be little wonder that dentistry be on its knee we will shortly set out plan to introduce supervised tooth brushing for to year old in the most deprived community and we be work with the dental sector to implement our rescue plan 
 new research from marie curie have find that of public expenditure on people in the final year of life in scotland be spend in hospital and only on community care the figure be very similar for england what work be be do to ensure a minimum standard of community treatment for people in the final year of life 
 it be vital that we have a palliative and end of life care service that work and be on a sustainable footing i have have discussion with the sector we want to ensure that we do not have the cliff edge that we have at the end of last year the hon gentleman be right to point to this and we will report back in due course 
 the minister will be aware that the contract uplift for dentist be face a near month delay can he confirm that dentist will be receive their uplift what will be do to make sure that they receive enough money to cover the cost of nhs dentistry 
 i can reassure my hon friend on that point we implement the contract uplift on   january dentist will therefore be receive their uplifted payment in march backdate to   april for the time in more than a decade we have also increase payment for practice train a foundation dentist 
 in maldon the number of patient per gp be already above the number for england and that will only increase with the amount of propose house building gps be struggle to cope with ever increase cost and i have practice still undertake so call collective action will the government review the whole system of gp funding before it break down completely 
 we be in negotiation about the future contract with the general practitioners committee england of the british medical association those negotiation be proceed and the right hon gentleman be right that we need serious reform we will be push reform through on that basis on his point about the estate we have a £ commitment on capital for the primary care estate which i think will go some way towards reassure he 
 i thank my hon friend the minister for all the support he have give the university of east anglia to set up its dental school but he will be aware that all those shiny new dentist come out in a few year time will be go into the private sector not the nhs unless we can sort out the nhs dental contract can he give we any kind of timeline for when we can expect to hear an announcement on that critical factor 
 i wish my hon friend all the good with his effort to get that dental school up and run as for the need for serious reform there be no perfect payment system but we have to get a payment system in place that make nhs dentistry attractive at least as attractive as do work in the private sector we be work at pace on that and i will report back on that as rapidly as possible 
 some child in be wait more than a year for medical treatment compare with in adult wait be at their bad in community medicine in dorset there be wait of up to year in child development and delay of a year be normal for child and adolescent mental health service per cent of all community health referral take more than a year will the minister confirm whether the week target will apply to community referral and not just hospital if not when can we expect a target so that child be not badly affect 
 the hon member be absolutely right to put the spotlight on paediatric health mental health be important for child and young people but physical health be too this government be commit to dramatically reduce waiting list and return to the week standard by the end of this parliament but we should aim to go even hard after those childhood waiting list because many child wait in pain and agony be lose valuable year of their childhood that they will never get back 
 the government know how hard i have work as co chair of the all party parliamentary group for medical cannabis on or under prescription i be pleased to hear that there be a trial but i urge the minister and her team to make sure that it actually go ahead as other have not because of brexit covid and election can she please meet i to ensure that the appg and i be keep up to date on the work of the nhs 
 my hon friend have be a strong campaigner on this issue on behalf of her constituent and i congratulate she on that work we be confident that the randomised trial will go forward and we have invest over £ in it i be very happy to meet she and i urge people to come forward and support the trial that be the way forward on this issue 
 the new health minister have state that it be okay for a human being to present as a llama if i have a family member who present as a llama and suddenly become ill in the middle of the night should i send for a doctor a vet or a straitjacket 
 i can say to the hon member that my hon friend the minister believe in treat every human be with the dignity and respect they deserve even the hon gentleman 
 shortly after the election the new government announce £ for a new community mental health hub in whitehaven unfortunately the local mental health trust   follow that decision by announce the closure of the yewdale ward for acute mental health service do the minister agree that we need to get early intervention right before we close acute service and will he bring together a meeting to scrutinise that decision 
 integrate care board be responsible for provide mental health service to meet the need of their local population as part of our plan for change we will reduce delay and provide fast treatment we be work with nhs england to transform mental health service shift care from hospital to local community and increase access to support for people across the country include in rural area 
 insomnia affect many patient include my constituent who be be advise by their gps to try cognitive behavioural therapy as an alternative to medication however digital cbt programme be not available on the nhs leave many without access to drug free treatment will the minister outline what step the government be take to ensure that patient have access to digital therapy so that more people can get access to evidence base drug free support 
 the hon gentleman hit the nail on the head when he mention the importance of evidence base treatment as part of the government ’s shift from hospital to the community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention the nhs absolutely should be in this space and we be consider those issue as we develop our year plan for health 
 the nhs south east london integrate care board provide service to my constituent and i have discuss some way in which we could well deliver service by redevelop the erith community hospital site in northumberland heath be the minister able to provide an outline of the government ’s plan to provide capital funding for expand community service like those at erith hospital 
 i would be delighted to meet my hon friend so that we can get into a bit more detail about what be happen in his constituency but he be absolutely right to point to the need for more and well community health service that will be at the heart of our shift from hospital to community in the year plan that we be deliver 
 health authority in devon be set to trial the relocation of a vital coronary service from torbay to exeter which be mile away will the minister meet i and fellow south devon mps who have grave concern about the impact on patient safety 
 it be important that people be able to get the right care in the right place at the right time and i recognise the challenge particularly in geography such as devon and cornwall which have more rural and remote community in the instance i encourage the hon gentleman to take this issue up with local health leader and his integrate care board but minister be always open to receive representation beyond that if he need further reassurance 
 before i call   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis   to ask his urgent question i must remind hon member of the house ’s rule relate to matter sub judice member should not refer to any matter that be currently before the court 
 on   november i grant a waiver in respect of the case of dillon and other v. the secretary of state for northern ireland give the issue of national importance raise by that case the waiver be ongoing and members may refer to the case in the house give that the coroner ’s verdict and finding in relation to the clonoe inquest have be publish i be content for that case to be discuss in the house however member should take care to avoid refer to any other active civil or criminal case 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland to make a statement on the coroner ’s ruling in the clonoe inquest 
 on   february a heavily armed unit of the provisional ira carry out an attack on coalisland police station arm with a mm heavy machine gun and akm rifle approximately round be fire but thankfully no be injure follow the attack the ira unit proceed to a car park where they be engage by soldier of the army ’s specialist military unit this result in man patrick vincent sean o’farrell peter paul clancy and kevin o’donnell be shoot and kill by the soldier 
 on   february mr justice humphreys sit as a coroner in the inquest into the circumstance of those death at clonoe chapel find that the use of lethal force by the soldier be unjustified and that 
 the operation be not plan and control in such a way as to minimise to the great extent possible the need for recourse to lethal force 
 the coroner far find that the soldier do not hold 
 an honest and genuinely hold belief 
 that the use of force be necessary to defend themselves or other 
 these be clearly very significant matter that require careful consideration i know that the ministry of defence be consider the coroner ’s finding therefore there be unfortunately a limit to what i be able to say in relation to the finding themselves particularly give that there be also an ongoing civil case relate to these event however it be clear the government must take such finding very seriously we owe a great debt to our armed force 
 order there be no sub judice to the case that you have just mention we must be clear on that so please let we not try to use that as a barrier i just want to be clear on that 
 i accept that entirely mr speaker i be merely point out as i think your statement allude to that there be an ongoing civil case 
 we owe a great debt to our armed force the vast majority of those who serve in operation banner during the trouble do so with distinction they operate in the most dangerous and difficult circumstance to protect the citizen of the united kingdom during the trouble over member of the security force lose their life in that endeavour it be right that we hold our armed force to the high standard we must also recognise the extreme circumstance that they face that be what set they apart from the terrorist organisation who indiscriminately murder over people during the trouble 
 i thank the secretary of state for take this statement personally i know that he do not have to so i thank he for that the government give notice at the election that they intend to remove the element of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act that protect soldier and police who serve during the trouble from prosecution last week ’s frankly speculative judgment from the northern ireland coroner into the clonoe shooting now expose a number of soldier to potential prosecution these be man who serve their country with honour heroism and skill sometimes in the face of the most incredible danger they be now mostly in their 60 and 70 and no doubt hop for a well earn peaceful retirement in his statement in december the secretary of state of speak of 
 recognise the dedicated service of the vast majority of police officer member of the armed force and the security service who do so much to keep the people of northern ireland safe during the trouble ”[official report   december vol c. 
 so precisely what be the government go to do to stop the vengeful pursuit of decent patriotic people if the government leave they open to persecution it will frankly be shameful and serve only to further the ira ’s attempt to rewrite the history of northern ireland 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for ask this urgent question as he will be aware this inquest be part of the year plan establish by the former lord chief justice and because the hearing be hold prior to the legacy act   may   cut off the inquest be able to be conclude for the avoidance of doubt it be not the result of anything that this government have do 
 the government set out in our election manifesto and the king ’s speech our commitment to repeal and replace the legacy act because it do something quite remarkable in unite the political party and community of northern ireland in opposition to it it be a fatally flawed piece of legislation that have be find in a number of respect to be incompatible with our obligation under the european convention on human right hon member ah this government believe in uphold our commitment to the european convention on human right even if other member do not share that view 
 i set out in my statement to the house of commons in december the approach that we be take and i will bring forward further proposal in due course i echo what the right hon gentleman say about the service of our armed force the police and security service during those terribly dark difficult and bloody day of the trouble 
 i thank   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis   for his urgent question and the secretary of state for his answer i have a simple question what do the secretary of state think this ruling will mean for peace and reconciliation and for bring community together in northern ireland 
 that be a judgment that individual and community will have to make have regard to what the coroner have to say there have be a very large number of inquest finding in relation to the trouble and the government and i understand the concern that have be raise by the coroner ’s finding in this case 
 the fundamental problem in northern ireland remain the legacy of the trouble and the fact that so many people still do not have an answer to the question of what happen to their love i be afraid the previous government make in my view a terrible mistake in decide that civil case and inquest would be close off 
 i also have to point out that the legacy act do not prevent the possibility of future prosecution because it be possible even under the law as it stand today for prosecution to be undertake if the independent commission find evidence that it think should be pass to the independent prosecution body 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you for grant this uq mr speaker 
 on a february night in man know terrorist arm with semi automatic weapon and a dushka machine gun capable of fire round a minute at a range of yard have already attack a royal ulster constabulary police station and be plan further attack these terrorist call themselves an army they carry weapon of war they seek to kill and they operate entirely outside the bound of the law yet we be ask to believe that the use of lethal force against they be not justify i be not a lawyer but if this be the state of the law then the law be an ass and it be up to parliament to change it 
 what if this have not be on the street of tyrone what if it have be on the street of birmingham what if it have be in parliament square would we be ask why those man have not be arrest would we find it acceptable that the court subsequently seek to punish those force that have risk their life for our 
 the consequence of this ruling be potentially very severe military morale weaken military recruitment reduce military effectiveness diminish and more retired servicemen in their decline year drag before the court for try to protect their countryman from terrorist for the record there be no defence minister on the treasury bench to hear this urgent question 
 the last government take step to ensure that a line be draw under court action like the hand down last week this government have say they will repeal that act but month into their tenure they have bring forward no plan when will the house see that legislation when we do see it will the secretary of state ensure that it include provision to protect servicemen such as those affect by the ruling from prosecution 
 the secretary of state will have see this morning the excellent report by policy exchange which put the cost of repeal the legacy act at hundred of million of pound the return to inquest and civil case will severely hit the budget of the police service of northern ireland without funding that will inevitably reduce policing and affect national security will his majesty ’s government commit to underwriting that liability 
 i will end by say that if we in this house think the law be not fit for purpose it be our job and our alone to change it that be what parliamentary sovereignty mean 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment i completely understand the concern which he have express with such passion about our armed service personnel include in relation to this case he have just say if this be the law the law need to be change be he suggest that the arrangement for inquest and the way in which they be conduct coroner sit hear the evidence and come to a finding ought to be change interruption that be a very interesting observation from his majesty ’s opposition 
 the legislation pass by the last government would have give the very terrorist who be kill in the exchange of fire if they have survive the ability to secure immunity from prosecution that be what the last government ’s legacy act do it would have give anyone soldier but also terrorist immunity from prosecution i be afraid that this government take the view that that be wrong and the court have determine that that be wrong that be why we will repeal and replace the legacy act 
 throughout the trouble both state and non state actor commit unlawful killing that have create harm and scarred family across both our island do the secretary of state agree that his government work with the northern irish party must find and build body that honour the stormont house obligation of article and compliant investigation and ensure that no victim maker nobody who carry out an unlawful killing whether uk state force ira or uda have the right to suppress truth from family 
 as i have previously indicate to the house i be commit in all my discussion with many of those affect include veteran to find a way forward that can command a degree of consensus in a way that the last government ’s legacy act fail to do i understand the strength of feeling be express in the house today i really do but there need to be some reflection on how a piece of legislation come to be pass that engender almost universal opposition in northern ireland the people of northern ireland who after all live through the trouble do not feel that that be the right way to proceed and time and again it have be find to be unlawful in other word we be leave with a mess and we be do our good to try to fix it 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis   for bring this issue to the house the liberal democrats be firmly committed to the principle of truth justice and accountability the violence carry   out by the ira during the trouble be abhorrent and inflict deep suffering on community across northern ireland at the same time uphold the rule of law be a fundamental principle that apply to all include the action of state force 
 the finding of the clonoe inquest highlight the importance of due process and transparency in deal with legacy issue it be vital that family seek answer about the past be able to access justice and that all event be subject to rigorous legal scrutiny that be the only way to build trust and support a last reconciliation in northern ireland 
 there have be immense progress in northern ireland since the good friday agreement and that progress be build on the principle of justice democracy and accountability we all of we must continue to uphold those principle if we be to secure a lasting and peaceful future for all community 
 the secretary of state recently say that legislation to revoke the deeply flawed legacy act which do not command confidence across northern ireland will be introduce when time allow will he offer detail on when that might be 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his observation the answer to his last question be when parliamentary time allow as soon as i be in a position to indicate when that will be i will tell the house 
 i very much agree with what the hon gentleman say about the violence inflict by terrorist be abhorrent it be important that in this house we make it quite clear that there be always an alternative to violence pursue the path of peace when people finally decide that that be the course of action that they should take we see a transformation in the life of people in northern ireland the tragedy be that so many people be kill and murder before we get to the point of the good friday agreement 
 the secretary of state ask rhetorically whether the law around inquest need to change the coroner have to answer question where when who and how he have no role in try to answer why but we know why deprave terrorist for the ira and their warped ideology try to destroy society and kill in our country 
 yesterday the defence secretary be clear when he say that those who serve in the sas that day 
 deserve and they will receive our full support ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 i will not stand for a rewriting of the past do the secretary of state agree with the defence secretary 
 i do not support a rewriting of the past either of course we should stand with our armed service veteran which be what the ministry of defence do i will say however that the coroner a judge consider the fact of the case and come to an independent judgment about they we be all of course perfectly free to express a view about the finding but to come back to my point in answer to the opposition spokesperson ’s early comment if member argue that the coronial system apply to inquest right across the country   should—[interruption if i may just finish the point if they argue that the system should be change because there be a great deal of feeling about particular finding that the coroner reach the house should give that careful consideration before go down that road 
 do the secretary of state accept that the northern ireland sentences act continue to apply that mean that no soldier and no terrorist convict of even the most heinous murder can serve more than year in jail those be the sort of compromise that have be necessary when the secretary of state accept that the legacy act would have give immunity to terrorist and soldier alike do he not recognise the principle of a truth recovery process couple with a statute of limitation as exemplify by what happen in south africa be what be good enough for nelson mandela not good enough for northern ireland 
 the right hon gentleman make a fair point society around the world that have face terrible conflict have each take their own path to try to find a way forward the release of prisoner in the year after the good friday agreement be a very bitter pill to swallow for many in northern ireland but i support that step it be nothing to do with i at the time because it be the right to take to enable the good friday agreement to be reach i say to the right hon gentleman that i have meet people include the family of a member of our armed force who be murder by the ira who express to i their bitter opposition to the immunity provision of the legacy act 
 the sharpen tension in northern ireland be palpable after the ruling the day after the shooting the provisional ira issue a statement boast that the man be in the east tyrone brigade and on active service mr speaker you and i know the bible and it be very clear live by the sword die by the sword if you live by a machine gun that you use to shoot a police station you die by a machine gun that be the way that i see it for right think people in northern ireland and indeed throughout this united kingdom to be tell that the use of lethal force be not justify fly in the face of common justice and feed the feeling that the judiciary be not just complicit but active in their rewriting of history what can the secretary of state do to rectify that situation 
 the finding of the coroner in this case stand for themselves and be on the record and all of we be able to read they in answer to the hon gentleman ’s direct question about what the government be do as i indicate to the house in my answer to   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis the ministry of defence be of course give very serious consideration to what the coroner have to say 
 i be astonish by the coroner ’s finding he be not ask to contemplate the question about why get inside the head of a soldier who be worried about whether they be go to be shoot dead be very difficult i serve in northern ireland and some of the decision that we have to take be instantaneous there be no time to mull they over it be either life or death i lose a very good friend captain robert nairac   the secretary of state say that the trouble with the last legacy act be that it give immunity to ira member but they already have immunity not just through the letter of comfort but because they keep no record so they can not be prosecute the only group that will be prosecute will be soldier like myself who never ask to go to northern ireland but go because we be tell to protect civilian and who serve their country they will be drag in front of the court because the government seem not to care about they 
 i say to the right hon gentleman who himself give distinguished service that i absolutely understand and recognise the point he forcefully make about the circumstance in which our soldier find themselves as part of operation banner they have see their comrade kill and they do not know what they be go to face as he rightly say in those circumstance soldier have to make very hard split decision 
 the coroner have a job to do he express his finding member of the house be express what they feel about those finding and the ministry of defence be consider they it be right and proper that we stand by our armed force which be why the government and the ministry of defence give support to veteran in those circumstance however i would point out that many many member of the provisional ira and the loyalist terrorist organisation be prosecute try and convict 
 base on the secretary of state ’s early comment be it not now clear that the secretary of state believe the government can not stand behind our brave soldier in this instance because of our membership of the european convention on human right therefore surely that be a perfect reason why we must leave the echr 
 that be not the government ’s position the government ’s position be indeed to stand behind our brave armed service personnel 
 by repeal the bill 
 by repeal the bill indeed which have be find repeatedly to be unlawful i make no apology for say to   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice   and to the house that this be a government who uphold the european convention on human right i recognise that some people say we should leave which would put we in the same position as some other country around the world with which i would not want the united kingdom to find itself associate the point about the european convention be that its right be for every single citizen those right may accord people with a decision that members of the house disagree with today but tomorrow they may protect the right of every single of we that be why we be commit to the echr 
 how will the secretary of state ensure that veteran who serve their country with distinction will not be hound through the court over event that may or may not have happen decade before 
 as history show decision about potential prosecution be take by independent prosecutor such decision be not determine by the government independent prosecutor have to take decision on the basis of the evidence and then court have to decide whether they be go to convict or not that be call the rule of law a distinguished former defence secretary ben wallace set out very clearly that the british army believe in the rule of law and be hold to the high standard and i agree with he i also agree with what the newly appoint veteran commissioner in northern ireland have to say about that in the comment that be report over the weekend 
 there be tangible anger in northern ireland over this preposterous verdict and the secretary of state ’s limp response today will not assuage that anger this be a secretary of state who want to see ira godfather gerry adams pay compensation because the wrong minister sign his detention order year ago this be a secretary of state who have today defend the retention of a coronary system that time without number put the security force in the dock but never the terrorist little wonder that confidence in the secretary of state be haemorrhage in northern ireland and this response only underscore why 
 as i make clear at northern ireland question recently the supreme court issue a judgment on the interim custody order relate to internment in the previous government know there be a problem and for quite a long period of time be unable to find a solution in the end the solution section and of the legacy act have be find to be unlawful but i have give an undertaking from the dispatch box that we be look at all lawful mean to prevent compensation from be pay in those circumstance i believe that we be take the right approach to the legacy act 
 on coroner i say for i think the time that if we have an inquest system that we support and that apply right across the piece it be not possible to write legislation that say we will have the verdict judgment and finding that we like but we will not have the finding that we do not like that be a decision—[interruption independent coroner make those decision in respect of individual case i feel the anger of many member of the house—[interruption will the hon and learn gentleman let i finish answer the question that he put i feel the anger that be be express in the house but we have an independent legal system in this country which be of the foundation of our freedom 
 the ira itself claim the terrorist shoot by the security force at clonoe describe their action that night as be active service they have just launch a cowardly attack on coalisland ruc station no doubt with murderous intent but they meet real soldier and they lose no doubt many innocent life be save by the security force as a result of that evening these be not innocent people but harden terrorist do the secretary of state agree that this be a justified and necessary operation within the guideline of military interception and will he condemn judicial ruling that seek to rewrite   history undermine our security force and embolden bloodthirsty terrorist who wage war against innocent people 
 i accept the characterisation that the hon member have ascribe to the individual clearly in fire round at the police station we know what their intent be that be what the provisional ira and terrorist on the loyalist side do during the course of the trouble and we have to speak of that as well the coroner ’s finding be there on the record member and public society be perfectly entitle to express a view and i acknowledge the concern that member have raise today it be a very serious issue and that be why it fall to the ministry of defence to consider the finding and what may follow 
 it be a great pity that no from the defence front bench team be here with we because i be sure that if they be they could confirm that the dshk machine gun that these man have be a weapon of incredible power if we be to look around the average city block there would be nothing that a dshk could not hit and put a bullet right through we now sit here warm and safe and consider the action of as we have hear brave man who have to take an instantaneous decision to stand up and face that weapon and the people who have already demonstrate that they be prepared to use it it stick in the craw that we hear the ira describe here as a unit”—as though they be some sort of army they style themselves as an army but they be not an army they be a murder gang simple as that be it not the case that the echr now skew the balance in their favour and that we be hide bind by the idea that there be an equivalence between the ira and the brave soldier of the sas who stand up and do what they have to do to protect innocent life 
 there be no equivalence at all none whatsoever for the reason that have be set out by member in this exchange follow the question ask by the right hon member for goole and pocklington there be nothing in the european convention on human right that say there must be equivalence our armed service personnel the ruc security service and other be do their good to protect the citizen of northern ireland from the murderous onslaught that they be subject to over the year of the trouble that be why there be no equivalence between they and those who choose in those circumstance to use violence to try to advance their cause in the end the terrible violence that we be discuss be bring to an end by the good friday agreement by people finally recognise that that be not the way to proceed 
 go back to the question ask about the cost by the opposition spokesperson   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart there be an alternative cost which be what we would have face if the good friday agreement have not be successful in bring peace to northern ireland we should recognise what a significant moment it be but we should stand with our soldier 
 much have be make in recognise the service of our armed force include the member of the ruc and the psni   because not only do they defend our community they live among they do the secretary of state agree that the soldier act inside the rule of engagement in that they believe their life be in danger from heavily armed terrorist who be intent on murder and that decision take in a split by the military commander be in his view justify 
 in all honesty i have to say to the hon gentleman that of course i be not present at the time i be not the coroner i have not look into the circumstance of the case and therefore i be not in any position to answer the question that he have put to i but i have read the summary of the coroner ’s finding they of course raise serious matter which be why the ministry of defence be consider they 
 as have be say people in northern ireland be appal at this decision by a coroner who incidentally would have have police officer protect he during the trouble i guarantee that have he be face with armed terrorist and those officer have ask they to put their hand up and surrender he would have be appal he would have expect they to be shoot people will be equally appal by the measly mouthed response from the secretary of state let i quote some of the thing he have say i can not comment on this we have to take seriously the judgment of the coroner and i will defend the echr even though it have be abuse by terrorist when will the secretary of state take the side of the soldier who fight in northern ireland and not be afraid that whatever he say here might offend sinn féin the ira and their supporter 
 i will only say to the right hon gentleman that the characterisation of the view that he attempt to attribute to i be incorrect but i make no apology for tell the house about this government ’s support for the european convention because this set of finding by the coroner have nothing to do with the european convention on human right the coroner be face with a set of circumstance he consider they and produce his finding as inquest do all the time people be entitle to criticise the outcome but it be an independent coronial process 
 compound the problem that the coroner have create with his comment be the fact that in the past whenever innocent people be kill the judiciary have comment that attention should be draw to those behind the scene who send young man out to carry out the killing these young man be send out to kill they have murder in their mind it be a pity that the coroner do not mention who be behind that why be their name not be bring to public light do the secretary of state agree that something like that might have help a little to minimise the compounding problem create by the coroner ’s comment at the time 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point about how we come to tell the truth about what happen to give the family answer i have meet many of they as have my predecessor about what really happen although we will repeal and replace the legacy act i decide to keep and reform the independent commission because i believe it offer the good mean of try to provide those answer in the round the   problem with the inqu system in certain case be that it have no capacity to deal with sensitive information the independent commission do that be why i urge family in northern ireland who be still seek answer to talk to sir declan morgan and his colleague because he be able to produce report that can range as widely as he think appropriate
