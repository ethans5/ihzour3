i start by declare an interest my wife be the joint chief executive of the law commission whose work i intend to cite in my remark 
 it be a pleasure to close this reading debate for the opposition and i thank all right hon and hon member who have participate in it i echo what so many other have say and add my own tribute to all the individual and organisation who have campaign for so long for reform in this area 
 as a number of contributor to the debate have point out we have wait a long time for this bill it be just under year ago that the then secretary of state   the right hon member for bromsgrove sajid javid announce that the government intend to introduce a series of measure to end unfair and abusive practice within the leasehold system include i quote here from a government press release in december 
 legislate to prevent the sale of new build leasehold house 
 that announcement be develop year later during the tenure of   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick   as secretary of state in a write ministerial statement date   january he announce 
 seminal part legislation to implement leasehold and commonhold reform in this parliament 
 the part of that part legislative agenda duly follow in the form of the leasehold reform ground rent act although we and in particular the shadow minister for homelessness and building safety my hon friend   the member for weaver vale mike amesbury press minister to use that act to   implement further reform we nonetheless support the government in pass it in the month since the act come into force successive ministers have make all manner of extravagant promise about what the part of the seminal part legislation would entail indeed the current secretary of state in an interview with the sunday times in january this year even go so far as to declare without qualification that he intend to abolish the leasehold system in its entirety 
 leaseholder across the country whose daily life be often make miserable by the unjust and discriminatory practice that our archaic leasehold system facilitate take tory ministers at their word they expect the part of the promise part legislative agenda to live up to the weighty promise make by the government they have be badly let down have wait so long and have their expectation raise so high they be understandably disappointed at the limited bill that we be consider today and it be a limited bill and no amount of bravado from the secretary of state can alter that fact they be also perplexed as we be that legislation that the government claim would end leasehold on newly build house in england and wales do not actually contain any provision to end such leasehold 
 when the minister respond to the debate he will no doubt attempt to brush that criticism aside as he do in oral question last week on the ground that it be entirely normal for key provision of a bill to be add in committee sadly as my right hon friend   the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner   mention in open the debate it be common practice for this government and this secretary of state in particular to significantly expand the size and scope of bills by incorporate swathe of government amendment in committee and on report in a way that limit the ability of hon member to ensure that full scrutiny take place however the minister be fool no in attempt to suggest that the omission from the legislation of key provision be always the government ’s intent 
 i remind the house as my hon friend   the member for city of chester samantha dixon   do that the right hon member for bromsgrove commit the government to legislate to prevent the sale of new build leasehold house nearly year ago the government have no excuse whatsoever for fail to include in the bill the provision necessary to enact that commitment in order for the house to consider they properly today that they fail to do so no doubt owe more to hurried drafting and to the wrangling between the department and no that have take place over recent month in respect of this bill than to any consider design however for all the confusion that surround it the legislation before we have answer important question how ambitious do the government wish to be when it come to leasehold reform because this unambitious piece of legislation make it clear that proponent of caution and restraint have win out over those who want to lay claim to a legacy of bold reform in this area 
 that criticism can not simply be brush aside as carp on the part of the opposition the government ’s poverty of ambition have real implication for leaseholder be routinely gouge by freeholder under the present system take flat which be the overwhelming majority   of new leasehold property be create and the source of most of the leasehold relate complaint that i receive from constituent the government ’s state solution for they as make clear by baroness penn in the other place just last week be reinvigorate commonhold yet the minister of state make it clear on monday that the government do not intend to incorporate into this bill any provision whatsoever relate to commonhold despite the clear commitment they make in instead it remain part of their long term approach in other word the government ’s offer to swathe of leaseholder across the country be jam tomorrow 
 the hon member for redditch rachel maclean know affectionately as no on these benches give the game away she say that all the work have already be do on commonhold so it be not a matter of complexity it be a political choice on the government ’s part not to introduce commonhold provision in this legislation what be so gall about the position that minister have adopt be that there be clearly widespread support across the house for the more ambitious leasehold reform that could have be incorporate into the bill and this debate have demonstrate it however in the die day of this government we be where we be 
 while we deeply regret the bill ’s lack of ambition we have no intention of vote against reading this evening we support the intent of the provision in the legislation before we and the principle of the bill as a whole the measure it contain will give homeowner in england and wales some great right power and protection over their home that be not to say that we do not have concern about the efficacy of some of they we do and we will seek to strengthen the bill in a number of way in committee for example we believe that clause and which be intend to protect leaseholder from cover the legal and valuation cost associate with lease extension require tighten if we be to prevent in practice freeholder recover litigation and non litigation cost to take another example we believe that clause which seek to replace the exist cost regime for right to manage claim be flawed and need overhaul if it be to protect in practice rtm company from cost claim by landlord 
 we also believe that this limited bill can be improve in way that will give future leaseholder more control over their future for example we think there be an iron strong case for add to the bill provision that would abolish forfeiture for lease entirely and replace it with a more equitable mean for freeholder to recover cost in a dispute that do not involve a windfall i be pleased by the signal that the secretary of state give on that front in open the debate to take another example we think there be merit in add to the bill provision that would ensure that lease on new flat include a requirement to establish and operate a resident management company responsible for all service charge matter and associated work with each leaseholder give a share 
 we will seek to convince the government of the merit of those and other measure when we go into committee in the new year and we will engage constructively with the government if they decide to introduce other bold measure into the bill at that stage for example if ministers be minded to implement the law commission ’s proposal on the right to manage cover both flat and house 
 however we recognise that there be only so much that we can do with the legislation before we give the paucity of the bill ’s ambition and the fact that it do not contain so many of the commitment that successive secretaries of state have make not least in relation to the promise widespread introduction of the commonhold tenure it be clear that it will now fall to a labour government to fundamentally and comprehensively reform the leasehold system include the reinvigoration of commonhold to such an extent that it will become the default and ultimately render leasehold obsolete 
 we be pleased that the bill will progress today it will provide some limited relief to leaseholder we will seek to improve it with a view to extract from the government any extra measure that far empower leaseholder and disturb the historical iniquity on which the present system rest leaseholder across the country who remain at the mercy of arcane and discriminatory practice to their detriment and to the benefit of freeholder rightly expect nothing less but leaseholder across the country expect so much more from the government we be clear that in due course labour will have to finish the job and enact all the law commission ’s recommendation on enfranchisement right to manage and commonhold in full we be determined to do so 
 i be very proud that more than student now have t level on their cv in the summer student complete their t level with a pass or above mean that we have a pass rate of before factor in remarking and retake we will publish a t level action plan with more information early next year 
 not content with be in the anti apprenticeship party give her plan to weaken the apprenticeship levy and halve the number of apprenticeship the hon lady be also take on the mantle of t level denier we have t level we have as i mention a pass rate we have student do our t level programme and we expect the datum that we will release early next year to show that many thousand more student be do the t level programme i be very proud of our t level programme i know that the hon lady will be eat mince pie at christmas but i suggest that early next year she may be eat humble pie because our t level programme be something to be proud of 
 in october the government announce the allocation of £ of start up funding to local authority for wraparound care which we know support parent to work as well as have the potential to improve attainment engagement and attendance 
 we be invest £ to transform the special educational need and alternative provision system that have include a increase in funding to birmingham where the timeliness of ehcp have be get well each year between and 
 as i say to the hon lady we have something like international student and our target be a year we be work very closely with sir steve smith we want to diversify to a whole range of different country to advertise ourselves to   international student but as i say the trend be good the hundred of thousand of international student who be here benefit our economy and provide an important source of income for university 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s question i be absolutely committed to the target of as i say in response to the previous question we have surpass that with well over student as i say they be of benefit to our university and our economy and they be a very important source of income for all our high education institution 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to help reduce the impact of industrial action by teacher on child and parent 
 last year ’s strike be of the big outbreak of industrial action in a generation over school day be lose with far reach consequence across our society we can not afford a repeat of that disruption and it be my duty to protect child ’s education that be why we be consult on minimum service level to end further disruption to education while provide certainty to parent msl will balance the right to strike with child ’s fundamental right to a good education 
 the issue extend to university student as well my constituent ’s final degree paper be not mark this year because of industrial action that put in jeopardy her postgraduate course and her employment offer her degree be issue only after her mother personally visit the dean of the university involve and demand action what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that degree exam paper be mark on time in the current academic year 
 our young people should never be pawn in the dispute of adult the behaviour of university and college union member be disgraceful and their action cause untold disruption and stress for thousand of student although the high education sector be independent of government the damaging impact of strike action can not go unchecked that be why we be consult on minimum service level in this sector unlike the labour party which always bow to its union paymaster 
 it be a pleasure to be call to ask a supplementary to the question 
 i be ever mindful of the importance that the industrial action finish have the secretary of state have any opportunity to discuss this with the department of education in northern ireland i understand that she have no responsibility for northern ireland but it be important that we work together to try to solve the problem of industrial action it be affect load of school particularly those whose pupil have special educational need i be really concerned 
 the hon member put his finger on it industrial action have a massive impact particularly on vulnerable child those with special educational need and those in exam cohort i be always happy to share with my counterpart in the devolved administration and i be very happy to share what we be do on minimum service level 
 what step her department be take to ensure the adequacy of school funding in county durham 
 nationally school funding will rise to over £ next year the high ever in real term per pupil this year the north east have the large percentage increase in per pupil funding in the whole of england 
 i welcome the minister to his place 
 every day be a school day but i wonder whether the new schools minister be familiar with the school cut website which indicate that out of school in county durham face spend cut in the cumulative impact of cut in county durham amount to £ equate to a £ cut per pupil do he believe that restrict school budget will help or hinder the educational opportunity and life chance for child in my east durham constituency 
 i have see the website that the hon member mention its calculation be base on some very speculative assumption and the conclusion that it reach should therefore be treat with great caution next year county durham will receive over £ base on current pupil number which be an extra £ for school 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i too welcome the minister to his place 
 on friday i join labour ’s candidate alan strickland on a visit to ferryhill school in county durham the staff team and student be amazing but staff be leave teach in portacabin the dining room and the sport hall the staff room be behind a curtain on a stage and year and be in a different town last week yet more school be add to the list of those with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and the secretary of state could not confirm how many will need complete rebuild give the urgency can the minister tell parent child and staff when this chaos will end 
 mr speaker allow i to take this moment to pay tribute to all school staff leader child and their family who have show great fortitude in deal with the disruption cause by raac we have move quickly to make sure all school with suspect raac be survey and to work with school to put in place alternative arrangement of course none of that be perfect but school have show great flexibility in work towards that such that we now have of affected school back with full time face to face education 
 what step she be take to increase childcare support for work parent

 last week the department for business and trade publish its response to its consultation on flexible working make clear that this government be commit to change to legislation that will enable more flexible working together with our expansion of childcare that will ensure parent have more choice over how when and where they work 
 welcome back mr speaker 
 the early education and childcare coalition have find that of nursery staff and of childminder be consider leave the early year sector in the next month and stroud business say the same thing that absolutely can not happen they be a skilled and amazing workforce whom parent trust with the most precious thing and the government have back the industry as integral to the growth strategy what evidence do my hon friend have that the uk be retain nursery staff and childminder and what can we be do to ensure the new system be successful 
 i thank my hon friend for her work champion the early year workforce and join she in the tribute she pay to they the total number of pay early year staff have remain stable in recent year and between and the number of staff increase by or people we will publish update statistic in the come week

 what we be do be make the single large investment ever make in childcare that be go to save the average family up to £ per year on the cost of childcare in contrast to the hon gentleman ’s party which have no policy for this area whatsoever 
 what recent assessment she have make of trend in the number of student complete t level course 
 what recent assessment she have make of trend in the number of student complete t level course 
 i be very proud that more than student now have t level on their cv in the summer student complete their t level with a pass or above mean that we have a pass rate of before factor in remarking and retake we will publish a t level action plan with more information early next year

 accord to make uk of manufacturing vacancy be hard to fill because of a lack of skill there be few apprenticeship start than in the prime minister cast doubt on the future of t level in his conference speech when he say that he think they should be scrap just what be the government ’s plan or will they leave it to my hon friend   the member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson   to address the chronic shortage of technical skill over which they have preside 
 i would have think that the hon gentleman would celebrate the plus apprenticeship start in his constituency since we have build our skill revolution in everything from apprenticeship and our t level programme to our high technical qualification free boot camp and free level course and that be drive the increase skill uptake it be worth note that we have have apprenticeship start over the past year he should welcome that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 shockingly result last summer reveal that in student drop out of their t level course which be high than for early cohort something be go very wrong in april the education committee raise major concern about t level roll out regional variation and fall employer engagement access to opportunity really matter so should the minister not now pause and review the defunding of alternative qualification as labour would and urgently bring forward the t level action plan in order to address concern raise by the select committee and ofsted and bring much need clarity and support for college employer parent and student

 if her department will make an assessment of the potential impact of after school childcare on long term educational outcome 
 in october the government announce the allocation of £ of start up funding to local authority for wraparound care which we know support parent to work as well as have the potential to improve attainment engagement and attendance.[official report   december vol c. 7mc 
 i recently visit muschamp primary school in carshalton and wallington where i observe the junior adventures group uk a lead provider of school age childcare in my constituency in the crucial support that it give child particularly those with special educational need beyond school hour however it be evident that school age childcare need reform i welcome that £ but can my hon friend explain how the framework will ensure that that investment effectively support family specifically those with requirement for special educational need and disability 
 my hon friend make an important point we have set out clear expectation that all wraparound provision should be inclusive and accessible we have give local authority flexibility in how to spend their funding but we expect they to distribute it in a way that ensure equal access to provision for parent of child with special educational need 
 what step her department be take to support pupil with special educational need and disability 
 we want all child to receive the right support to reach their full potential that be why since march we have open new special free school with more approve we have launch our £ change programme benefit every region in england and test key send and alternative provision include innovative approach to speech and language therapy and to help young people with special educational need into work we be double the number of support internship to by by next year we will have increase high need funding by to over £ in just year 
 last year in buckinghamshire in education health and care plan be issue outside the legally require week timeframe will the secretary of state outline what concrete step the department be take to improve access to educational psychologist and reduce waiting time for ehcp 
 i know how hard parent fight to get the right support for their child sometimes that take too long and i be determined to make that easy which be why we be simplify and standardise the ehcp process however to deliver that support we need our fantastic teacher teach assistant and specialist send teacher without they we could not provide child with the support they require that be why we be boost training opportunity through a new national professional qualification for special educational need co ordinator which will be launch in autumn and invest a furth £ to train more educational psychologist we be also train up to early year specialist over of whom have begin their training we now have teaching assistant in our school an increase of over since we have be in office 
 in child in education in my constituency receive special educational need support thank to the department for education we have have a new special school the austen academy that be a free school and significant increase in budget but can we also ensure that teach child with special need be a mainstream part of teacher education support child with special educational need every day be now a mainstream part of school 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question that be exactly why we be develop a new npq for senco which will launch in autumn and be inputte into the standard for teacher training to ensure that everybody have an understanding of how good to support child there be now a lot of child with special educational need and we all need to know how to support they well 
 from my citywide consultation of parent of child with send it come to light that the particularly harsh and punitive disciplinary process be exercise in school   be have a very harmful effect on many of those child will the secretary of state or the schools minister meet i to discuss a particular multi academy trust in my constituency where those process be have a very negative impact on young people 
 i be very happy to confirm that the minister for child and family will be happy to meet the hon lady

 i be very happy to work with my right hon friend to improve thing in lancashire spectrum of light sound like it be do an amazing job there be many people who be look to well support our child with special educational need of course we recognise that we need to improve aspect which be why we publish an improvement plan in march this year

 would be educational psychology trainee for september have be leave in limbo because of delay in the department confirm the available funding the number of educational psychologist have fall since despite request for education health and care plan increase every year that national shortage of qualified practitioner be contribute to the crisis in send that be affect so many family across the country do the secretary of state agree that this uncertainty about government funding for educational psychology training be unacceptable and when do she expect it to be resolve 
 we announce in november that a furth £ be go to be spend to train more than educational psychologist 
 what step she be take to reduce waiting time for child with special educational need and disability to receive support 
 in our improvement plan we set out plan to deliver consistent early support through our new national standard back by a increase in high need funding and in programme such as our £ investment in the partnerships for inclusion of neurodiversity in schools programme which support the need of neurodiverse child 
 more than half of child with an education health and care plan be now experience a delay and even after receive an ehcp my constituent ’s child be hold back a year and have to wait another year before find a space in a special school over child in the uk have special educational need so can the minister tell i what he be do to ensure that parent and child such as my constituent get the support they need quickly 
 we be invest £ to transform the special educational need and alternative provision system that have include a increase in funding to birmingham where the timeliness of ehcp have be get well each year between and 2022.[official report   december vol c. 8mc 
 beyond the traditional method of support for send the minister will know that council give specialist provision and we have hear a lot today about some of those long term provision for child in particular and the time involve what assessment do the department make when look at the distance that some of these child need to travel to get this specialist support particularly when it be out of county for example shropshire into staffordshire it may not seem a long distance but on some of those meandering serpentine road it can take a very long time to travel mile 
 my right hon friend make an important point out of county placement be not ideal for the child and their family or for the cost to the local authority which be why we have new special school in fruition we be also committed to see the child whose need can be meet in a mainstream school be support at an early enough stage with their special educational need 
 i call mark francois 
 thank you sir it be good to see you back safe and well in the chair as this be the near i be ever go to get to it no please laughter

 the minister mention the £ that the government have invest but this be not filter down that be the key issue for parent access sen provision and so many parent be raise it at my surgery concerned mother tell i 
 parent and child be be put under intolerable stress and anxiety with a system which be inefficient and create a significant mental health burden 
 the minister mention the national standard will the standard include the fact that sen child and child with autism be be arrest and their mental health be not be treat properly because school simply do not have enough training and support will the minister please address that 
 i thank the hon lady we be keen that school be as inclusive as they say they will be when it come to child with special educational need we have change programme partnership to try to make sure that the system work a lot well the money be give to local authority and we should already be see an improvement but i would be happy to discuss it far with she 
 what step her department be take to help ensure that tertiary and technical education provider work with business to meet local skill need 
 what step her department be take to help ensure that tertiary and technical education provider work with business to meet local skill need 
 we be transform skill through our local skill improvement plan back by £ and support by business further education and high education and though a £ investment in institutes of technology which be collaboration between business high education and further education to revolutionise our tertiary education offering 
 i thank my right hon friend for that response stoke on trent college have recently launch its new skills ready future ready strategy and have be work with a number of employer locally to fill skill shortage and it be very welcome to see the local skill improvement fund investment of around £   for stoke on trent and staffordshire but give our industry locally and the skill shortage we need to go far so what will my right hon friend be do to help fill some of those skill shortage to support our industry to help people earn well wage and get skilled now 
 my hon friend be a true champion of skill in stoke on trent and as he mention we strongly support the £ we be invest through the local skill improvement fund that be underpin by £ of additional national investment and my hon friend will be pleased to know we will be open the stoke on trent staffordshire institute of technology in september with £ of capital funding as part of our revolution in tertiary education 
 my constituency be at the beat heart of motorsport valley and it be critical for motorsport ’s future success that we get skill training and education right for young people who want to go into that sector the grand prix trust be support that effort have launch a £ annual bursary scheme to help disadvantaged college student become part of the dynamic british motorsport sector a partnership with the national college for motorsport and silverstone university technical college will my right hon friend join i in welcome this fantastic initiative and tell i what more he can do to help promote this important work 
 my hon friend highlight the skill revolution we be have in this country and the initiative he have mention increase the collaboration between business and skill provider to help disadvantaged student in his constituency to climb the ladder of opportunity in a high profile industry i extend my thank to pat symonds chief technical officer of formula and martin brundle chairman of the gpt trustee my hon friend will be pleased to know that the south central institute of technology base in milton keynes be also explore opportunity to work with motorsport in the area 
 plymouth be home to world class skill in marine and nuclear engineering demand for apprentice in our city be grow especially with the construction of new berth and dock for nuclear submarine at devonport dockyard do the minister agree that skill training and apprenticeship be just as important as new crane and new dock in make these project a success and support our armed force and will he meet i a delegation of plymouth business our city council and city college plymouth to look at how we can turbocharge create more apprenticeship in our city to deliver these exciting and innovative project 
 the hon gentleman will be pleased that his constituency have receive over apprenticeship start since which be really good news but he be absolutely right that our skill offer be the key for future employment and job and to ensure people climb the ladder of opportunity we have the apprenticeship the bootcamp the high technical qualification and the free level course but i will look at what he say and would be happy to meet he and other plymouth mp to work through the important issue he mention 
 tertiary education provider be themselves business that seek to meet local skill need and the university of exeter be no different it host international student who contribute £ to devon ’s economy people in devon do not think of these student as immigrant give how this funding help boost skill among local people so will the minister talk to his counterpart in the home office about take student out of the net migration figure 
 as a former exeter university student myself i know how brilliant it be and it also have a huge and incredibly successful programme of degree apprenticeship i be very supportive of international student they bring a lot of income to our country visa matter be always matter for the home office but i be sure there will be discussion about the issue raise by the hon gentleman 
 what recent assessment she have make of trend in the number of support staff vacancy in school 
 support staff play a vital role in our school we have give school the freedom to recruit the staff they require to meet their own need although we do not collect central datum on vacancy as a result i can tell the hon lady that the number of support staff work in school have increase for the past year 
 we have already hear in this question time about delay in get the education health and care plan in lancashire as a consequence rural school like quernmore which i have the privilege of visit on friday be leave with more child with special educational need in mainstream but without the financial support package that should come with that these small rural school be therefore have to support child with additional need and do not always have the right number of staff to be able to do so in the way they would like be support available to rural and small school especially in lancashire to meet the need of all child 
 we must meet the need of all child and at some level every teacher be a teacher of special educational need and disability i recognise that there can be particular difficulty for small school in rural area as the hon member mention we have the wide ehcp system which be well than the previous system on place available in special school where child be in mainstream school i recognise the central role play by teach assistant that be why we have set out in the send and alternative provision improvement plan how we will look to consolidate that position and give further advice on the good deployment of ta 
 what step she be take to help reduce the workload of teacher 
 reduce unnecessary workload be a priority for the department and for i we have convene a workload reduction taskforce of expert teach union and practitioner to make recommendation on how to minimise workload for teacher and school leader 
 it be good to see you back mr speaker and look so well 
 the last minute nature of ofsted inspection be cause huge anxiety to my small rural school in meon valley that mean that teacher and in particular headteacher be put off activity such as residential school trip educational trip and professional development course in case they get that call from ofsted will my right hon friend consider change the notice period for inspection so that teacher can plan their workload well 
 i value all those activity that my hon friend set out that school undertake for their child like she i represent a rural constituency indeed we have next door constituency i recognise what she say about small rural school inspection have an important role to play but ofsted also have the flexibility in the framework to take account of the particular position of small school 
 teacher workload be be exacerbate by teacher vacancy that school be struggle to fill and funding pressure be result in cut to support staff who often support the most vulnerable and needy child that be lead to an exodus of teacher from our school just last week we see the staggering figure from the government that teacher train recruitment target have be miss by a whopping in our secondary school with the sharp fall in math which be allegedly a priority for the prime minister how bad do it have to get before the government will produce and implement a proper workforce strategy 
 i can confirm that there be more teacher and more teaching assistant in our school compare with we have the most talented generation of teacher ever and we continue to focus on a strong recruitment and retention strategy so that we continue to get the good talent to teach our child 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the workload and stress level of teacher rise exponentially during an inspection i be sure that the minister will join i in offer condolence to the friend and family of ruth perry in the light of the coroner ’s verdict that the rude and intimidate nature of the ofsted inspection contribute to ruth perry ’s tragic suicide how be the minister ensure the welfare of school leader be prioritise during inspection 
 i of course extend my condolence to the friend and family of ruth perry it be the most awful tragedy my right hon friend the secretary of state will say a word on that tragedy and ofsted in a moment for now let i just say that of course the   inspection framework and process must both be fully informative to parent and supportive to teacher and school 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the impact of free school meal on child and their parent 
 free school meal support disadvantaged family to the value of £ a year ensure that eligible pupil receive a healthy nutritious meal the government have expand free school meal more than any other in recent decade now more than a of pupil in england receive they compare with a in 
 recently we have have high food inflation while i welcome the fact that the government have now halve inflation of my small school have tell i that it be unable to provide free meal within the money allocate as it can not benefit from the same economy of scale as large school will my right hon friend review the fund available for small school 
 i acknowledge my hon friend ’s point the national funding formula recognise that some school be necessarily small and do not have the same opportunity to realise economy of scale every school receive a lump sum irrespective of its size—£134,000 for next year and the government have reform the sparsity factor increase funding for that from £ in to £ in 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of trend in the level of university application from international student on the long term sustainability of high education institution 
 i be pleased that we have surpass our target with well over international student they remain an important source of income and a source of pride for our university and the total impact of international student be worth £ across the duration of their study 
 as the minister have just mention the economic benefit of overseas student be some £ spread between university and economy across the uk but application in this ucas admission round be down with increasingly stiff competition from elsewhere uk institution can not simply rely on their excellent reputation so what more can the minister do to ensure that the uk remain an attractive place for international student to study 
 as i say to the hon lady we have something like international student and our target be a year.[official report   december vol c. 8mc we be work very closely with sir steve smith we want to diversify to a whole range of different country to advertise ourselves to   international student but as i say the trend be good the hundred of thousand of international student who be here benefit our economy and provide an important source of income for university 
 i call the shadow minister matt western 
 it be great to see you mr speaker 
 as well as contribute to britain ’s world lead research the financial contribution of international student be vital to uk university particularly at a time of rise cost pressure and real term fee value erosion any sudden change in the number of international student come to the uk obviously put the high education sector at risk the minister speak of his pride but i would like to stress the point and ensure that he put this on record can he absolutely give his assurance to the house that the government remain robust in their ambition to continue to attract international student a year as lay out in the international education strategy 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s question i be absolutely committed to the target of as i say in response to the previous question we have surpass that with well over students.[official report   december vol c. 8mc as i say they be of benefit to our university and our economy and they be a very important source of income for all our high education institution 
 what recent assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of trend in the level of violence in classroom 
 of course no should face violence in school in england we have take decisive action to improve pupil behaviour through strengthen the behaviour in school guidance and invest in give support and propagate good practice through the behaviour hub 
 the late pisa figure which be release in the last few week show a stark picture of violence in school across the whole uk nowhere else in the oecd do rate of violence reach anywhere near the level in the uk pupil be almost twice as likely as the oecd average to witness a fight in their school—39 in england and in scotland and as a teacher i can say from experience that violence in school disrupt every part of pupil learning exclusion clearly be not work and the scottish government ’s recently announce proposal in scotland be to put all the responsibility on teacher what more can the government do to illustrate a way forward for school to deal with this problem so that young people ’s learning be not hamper by violence in the classroom 
 for completeness we ought to note that the pisa study note that the great majority of pupil in england report feel safe in school very similar to the oecd average and be less likely than the oecd average to see the most serious manifestation of such behaviour such as see gang at school or see somebody with a weapon 
 it be absolutely true that school must have the full range of measure at their disposal there be no right level of exclusion and it should not be use lightly but it have to be there it have to be available early in our time in government we make it clear that teacher can use reasonable force we also extend search power remove the requirement to give parent hour write notice for after school detention and simplify advice on how to prevent and tackle bullying because a safe and ordered environment be essential for both child ’s education and their general wellbeing 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 ruth perry ’s death be a tragedy that leave a hole in the heart of her family her community and her school throughout this year i have be honour to work closely with ruth ’s sister julia and her friend lisa and edmund to introduce important change to inspection practice alongside ofsted which ensure that headteacher can share their inspection outcome include with colleague friend and family our new change mean that if a school be grade inadequate due to ineffective safeguarding but all other judgment be good it will be reinspecte within month that have now happen at caversham primary school which be regrade as good this summer we also double the wellbeing support for our school leader in life ruth dedicate herself to her school and we will build on her legacy to help ensure that such a tragedy never happen again 
 i thank my right hon friend for her statement i agree with those sentiment 
 this conservative government will fund a new school to replace the flood prone tipton st john primary school which have have to close time this year and have another near miss last week due to intense heavy rainfall it be vital that spade be in the ground next year for the new school will she meet i to discuss this urgent matter far

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i start by again send my condolence and those of the entire labour party to the family of ruth perry we must all now listen and learn to deliver an inspection system that work in the good interest of child school staff and community 
 the education secretary have say that her government be do everything to get child into school yet this term the attendance rate have decline consistently hit a terrible new low in the late figure be not the real truth simply that the government see attendance as a problem affect other people ’s child 
 absolutely not attendance be my no priority i regularly meet and chair the attendance action alliance group and we be determined to help ensure that child be in school because that be where they can get the good education we be work with gps and other medical professional to ensure that everybody be aware that school be a good place to be actually a well place to be for those with mild anxiety and secondly we be there to give support in school and we want everybody to be in school those effort be start to pay off we now have few child miss school but it be very much at the top of my agenda 
 if it be the secretary of state ’s no priority why be she not legislate for a register of child not in school that measure have wide support right across this house but it be miss from the king ’s speech despite the secretary of state ’s repeat promise to legislate despite it have be in the government ’s abandon schools bill and despite it be in her department ’s submission accord to the permanent secretary at the department will the secretary of state confirm as the permanent secretary suggest that it be block by no 
 no absolutely not of course more thing go into king ’s speeches than there be legislative time that be a process that the permanent secretary lay out but it be my priority and i hope to legislate on it in the very short term 
 i hear from a school in my constituency last week that even though it have school counsellor there be a long waiting list for child with mental health concern to see a counsellor what step be my hon friend take to ensure that school be adequately resource to good support pupil in that regard 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue we know that school base provision work well when all staff be clear about how to support mental health which be why we be provide senior mental health lead training grant to all state school of which have claim a grant so far we be also work with the department of health and social care to extend mental health support team to cover at least of pupil by spring 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 if there be to be hope for a peaceful solution in the israel gaza conflict the input of palestinian academic will be crucial but many have already lose of their life could the minister make a statement about representation that he have make to cabinet colleague about introduce an emergency humanitarian visa for academic in gaza 
 i will write to the hon lady about that 
 parental choice be crucial be it not to that end when will wave of the free school programme open 
 my right hon friend and constituency neighbour have be a long time champion on this matter and i know his local work well there be free school open and a further plus be in the pipeline there be a current round of application for consideration of special and alternative provision free school but further capital would be a matter for future spending review 
 the independent review of relationship sex and health education in school submit its recommendation to the secretary of state back in september when will those recommendation be make public if they be not to be make public why not 
 as the hon gentleman know we be conduct a review of rshe guidance these be important and sensitive topic and it be important to get they right he will not have long to wait to see the result 
 the secretary of state will be familiar with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in essex and i thank she and her ministerial team for their support can she give an assurance that contractor such as mitie employ to build a temporary accommodation unit for local school be work with school to deliver programme on time and to meet their need right now we be see delay that be affect the educational outcome of local child 
 the temporary classroom at st andrew ’s junior school be deliver by essex county council which i thank once again for its exemplary leadership manage raac in essex the department be work closely with all party to ensure that any concern be address quickly work be ongoing today to fix a disabled access door i can confirm that we will remove raac from all school and college setting will be offer either grant funding or rebuilding project we be assess the right solution for each case and we will update the house shortly 
 swallowfield primary school have a space constrain site in my constituency and rely on temporary accommodation to provide important special educational need and disability intervention for pupil however because of an inadvertent breach of section of the school standards and framework act it have have a loss of space and may lose that unit because of the compromise effect on outdoor space give that the space lose could never have be use for recreational purpose 
 order these be topical question 
 it sound like there be important detail to get to grip with so i be happy to meet the hon gentleman 
 the government be rightly focus on technical as well as academic education with the new british standard university technical college sleeve would support the government to enhance pre-16 technical education in secondary school will the extra £ make available for technical education in school in the autumn statement be available for utc sleeve 
 my hon friend be a champion for utcs and technical education i be delighted that the secretary of state recently approve more utc a couple of week ago i visit the brilliant harlow bmat stem academy which be a utc and utc portsmouth we will respond shortly to lord baker ’s request for a utc sleeve pilot as she mention 
 corpus christi junior school on brixton hill have be close since july due to raac we now have tender approve for the significant work that the department for education say be necessary and that it would pay for but they must begin in january to ensure that they be complete in time could the secretary of state explain why despite repeat request her department have still not approve the necessary funding any further delay could mean that my young constituent be leave with further disruption and no building to learn in for the next academic year 
 we be as the hon lady will know commit to ensure that reasonable cost for temporary accommodation and so on be cover in the immediate term and beyond to make sure that capital cost be cover for either refurbishment or in some case rebuild there will be further detail to come before long 
 england have shoot up the international ranking in education but school in wales have not do that not show that conservative education reform be help kid to thrive in school in england 
 yes we have to compare and contrast that with wales which have the low educational standard in the uk the simple answer to why that be be that it be run by labour under labour our education standard plummet from to in math from to in reading and from to in science thank to the hard work of our teacher and pupil and the reform under this conservative government we have rocket back up the table to for math and for reading and science every time labour get power education standard fall the conservatives be the only one take the long term decision to deliver a well education for our child 
 please work with i to enable everybody to get in 
 despite my private member ’s bill on statutory guidance to reduce the cost of school uniform the education guidance about costs of school uniforms act far too many school require a plethora of logo and branded item when can we expect more robust intervention from ministers to deal with this issue 
 school should be reasonable in what they do and that be what our guidance set out 
 staff at bramhall high school have work extremely hard to maintain the education of student follow the discovery of raac i be grateful for the support give by the   department and stockport council to ensure that temporary classroom will be in place in the new year will my right hon friend join i in thank the headteacher and the staff for all their hard work give the exist condition of the school will he join i in call for it to be include in a new build programme

 last week the government publish an update of the list of school with raac will the minister confirm that the department be seek to cross check its list of school affect by raac with the bbc because it remain the case that the bbc journalist have more of a grip on this crisis than the government 
 we have a lot of people work on this and rightly so include make sure that all the survey get do we have also commit to be transparent which be why we publish regular update to the list we continue to work at pace to try to resolve the problem as quickly as possible for the good of the child 
 malvern college in my constituency employ hundred of local people support the local economy earn export earning for our country ensure that people around the world love the uk and be a huge supporter of our local school what kind of destructive ideology would put all that at risk and make the uk the only country in the world to tax education 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be a dreadful policy and it will have exactly the opposite impact it will probably actually cost money and mean child move school and all because the labour party just play the politic of envy 
 i offer my deep condolence to the family of ruth perry follow the inquest last week will the secretary of state now consider the removal of the single word judgment from ofsted inspection report 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for arrange the initial meeting with julia waters ruth ’s sister who i know be his constituent and attend the few i will be work very closely with the new chief inspector of school when he start week today to see what more we can do but we must remember that ofsted play an important role in keep child safe and standard high 
 order may i ask everyone to help i out in future please some may not realise that topical question be mean to be speedy so that all member can be accommodate 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the international diplomacy surround the israel hamas war 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question the government be undertake extensive and global diplomatic engagement to get much great aid into gaza support british national and the safe return of hostage and prevent dangerous regional escalation day after hamas ’s brutal attack the then foreign secretary be in israel to see for himself the devastation work by this heinous act of terrorism and his successor visit in late november to continue dialogue with israeli leader last week the prime minister discuss the late effort to free hostage with prime minister netanyahu and stress the need to take great care to protect civilian in gaza day later the foreign secretary discuss the future of the middle east peace process with the us secretary of state in washington 
 the situation in gaza can not continue and we be deploy all our diplomatic resource include in the united nations to help to find a viable solution the scale of civilian death and displacement in gaza be shocking although israel have the right to defend itself against terror restore its security and bring the hostage home it must abide by international law and take all possible measure to protect civilian we have call for far and long humanitarian pause it be imperative that we increase the flow of aid into gaza but as we have say at the un call for a ceasefire ignore the fact that hamas have commit act of terror and continue to hold civilian hostage 
 we remain committed to make progress towards a state solution britain ’s long stand position on the middle east peace process be clear we support a negotiate settlement lead to a safe and secure israel live alongside a viable and sovereign palestinian state 
 i know that you continue with your good endeavour mr speaker but when it come to a matter as important as this i think we see why it be so problematic that the foreign secretary be not in this house 
 the scale of death and destruction see in gaza over the last month have be intolerable the child leave under the rubble the family displace from their home and the many innocent palestinians face the threat of starvation and disease despite international pressure on israel to change the way it be fight to not replicate the kind of devastating tactic that it use in the north to protect school and hospital and to ensure that humanitarian aid be ramp up labour share grave concern that those condition be not be meet 
 diplomacy not bomb and bullet be the only route to a last peace the grave warning from the united nations can not be ignore and they show the urgent need for action to relieve the suffering it be right that the un security council have be debate this war but it constitute a failure that it have be unable to reach a consensus and to speak with a collective voice   labour want a resolution to pass the un security council a resolution that properly condemn hamas terrorist and the appalling   october   attack on israel and call for the release of all hostage a resolution that demand a renew cessation of hostility and the protection of palestinian civilian a resolution that act as a stepping stone towards an endure end to this war 
 we can not give up too much be at stake can the minister explain what step he will now take to help reach that consensus can he update the house on any progress to open up the crossing at kerem shalom international diplomacy must focus on gaza but it must also focus on further escalation in the west bank and the wide region include lebanon will the government therefore increase pressure on the israeli government in the west bank by impose travel ban on illegal settler involve in attack serious criminal activity and the fostering of hatred will he say unequivocally like labour that we will not tolerate the expulsion of the people of gaza or the west bank and that they must be able to return to their home finally will the minister and the government back labour ’s call for a joint western and arab lead international contact group to replace the defunct quartet 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i recognise the enormous authority that lord cameron hold in these matter and the right hon gentleman ’s request that he should be available in the house i will do my good to satisfy he on the question that he have ask as he know lord cameron be keen to engage with the house of commons in every possible way 
 the right hon gentleman ask why britain do not support the un security council resolution i can tell he clearly that there be a lot good stuff in the resolution that britain do support but there be no condemnation of hamas and for that reason we feel unable to support it however we do not oppose it because it have a lot of useful and important stuff in it and we therefore abstain he will recall that there have be a number of resolution we vote yes to the un resolution draft by the americans but that be veto by china and russia apparently because they could not bring themselves to condemn what hamas have do on   october 
 the right hon gentleman ask i about settler violence the targeted killing of civilian be completely abhorrent and we be seek that those responsible should be not just arrest but prosecute and punish on his comment about travel ban i can tell he that planning be go on the foreign secretary discuss this with his us counterpart last week and i hope it may be possible to say something about that shortly the right hon gentleman also ask about kerem shalom i think that the position of kerem shalom be be enhance at the moment and i hope very much that that will lead to some facilitation but those discussion be ongoing at this time 
 i be sure that the minister will want to condemn the gratuitous sign of antisemitism that we see on the street again this weekend which lead to karen pollock from the holocaust educational trust describe london as 
 a no go zone for jewish people 
 i know that he will want to condemn that on the broad issue of a negotiate ceasefire will he confirm that the government ’s position be as it have be throughout namely that hamas can play no role in the future of the governance of gaza and that it be hamas who be responsible for what be happen in gaza today 
 i very much agree with what my hon friend have say on his point about a ceasefire at the moment a ceasefire be wholly implausible of all hamas would not agree to they have make it absolutely clear that they want to replicate the terrible act that take place on   october so i fear that that be not go to happen that be why we call for extended humanitarian pause and as i understand it that remain the position of his majesty ’s official opposition 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 humanitarian aid agency be now repeatedly warn in strong and unmistakable term that they simply can not fulfil their mandate in gaza the united nations relief and works agency have say that gaza be hell on earth over palestinians now need food assistance what the hell be the uk government do allow people to starve to death when they could do something about it what in god ’s name make they think it be acceptable to stand by as more than people be injure and the hospital that would have treat they be be bomb and starve of supply when they could have an influence over that how on earth have we reach a time when people have be slaughter in gaza by government say so and still they be not call for a ceasefire do they know that thousand of people in the uk be now scream in horror at their tv screen because they just can not believe what they be witness in gaza and that they be stun by the uk ’s response which be to say that israel have the right to defend itself all country have the right to defend themselves but how can kill the former glasgow university student dima alhaj and her month old baby ever be describe as self defence why do the uk abstain on the un resolution call for a ceasefire the former home secretary call that disappointing i call it shameful 
 i recognise the passion with which the hon lady speak but i have explain in some detail why the government feel it be not possible to support the resolution we do not oppose it we abstain 
 i urge the hon lady to think again as a ceasefire be wholly implausible it be much more sensible to try to get these humanitarian pause where we have see some success we urgently need to see more for the reason she set out so eloquently 
 the prime minister have repeatedly express his unequivocal support for israel ’s right to defend itself may i urge the government to maintain that position to stay the course and to ensure that we continue to give israel our strong support 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right we have make it clear that israel have every right to defend itself but that it must abide by international humanitarian law and the law of war 
 it be 
 wrong and illegal to target civilian international law be very clear that there must not be the targeting of civilian 
 those be not my word but the word of the new foreign secretary and then prime minister during the war in gaza give that over palestinian child alone have be kill can the minister confirm whether the foreign secretary and therefore this conservative government still believe that israel ’s target of civilian be wrong and illegal what step be he take to hold the israeli government to account 
 again i recognise the integrity with which the hon gentleman speak i can tell he that no the israeli government never target civilian but they be pursue a strategy of degrade and eliminate the appalling perpetrator and the military machine that work the terrible disaster that take place on   october which i remind he be a pogrom more jewish people be kill on that day than on any single day since the holocaust in 
 even if the foreign secretary be at the dispatch box today i doubt if he would do a well job than my right hon friend can he say whether the government have make any estimate of the number of hamas fighter who have be kill we seem to get very precise estimate of the number of civilian who have be kill but clearly a large number of hamas fighter be engage in oppose israeli force on the ground be any other people other than hamas fighter resist israeli force on the ground 
 i thank my right hon friend for his kind personal remark truth be often the casualty in war and none of the figure that we be hear can be rely upon 
 word now fail to describe the despondency feel by those of we who stand for peace when i say we i do not just mean those of palestinian descent i also mean people in israel who have fight for peace over many year the only way to have a last peace a peace without fear be to have state so i will repeat the question that i put last time what be this government do later today i will table a bill to recognise palestine will the minister meet i to discuss it how do we prevent this from happen ever again 
 i will of course be very pleased to meet the hon lady we have previously discuss the content of the bill in another situation but i will be very pleased to meet she 
 we be develop proposal the hon lady specifically ask what we be do and obviously we be try to lift people ’s eye to the political track that will at some point be possible we be look in detail at develop proposal for support for the palestinian authority to build up the sinew of statehood in pursuit of the establish policy of both the major political party in this house that there should be a state solution with israel live behind secure border and palestine as a free and independent state 
 the minister do say that too many palestinians have die in pursuit of a solution to the hamas problem but i wonder do he genuinely believe and be it the government ’s position that a military solution a military defeat of hamas be possible 
 i have no doubt that it be possible to degrade and stop the military machine that work the terrible disaster on   october when address an ideology however it be extremely important to recognise that a political process be absolutely essential that be why the government be spend along with our ally enormous amount of time in try to work through how that could be achieve 
 shamefully our government refuse to back the ceasefire at the un security council last week when a motion be support by country include france spain and portugal among other european nation in the face of the indiscriminate killing and suffering that we be see day after day in gaza be it not a failure of moral leadership to refuse to back a ceasefire will this constant refusal to back a ceasefire not be see as give the green light to israel to commit yet more war crime 
 i think the hon gentleman would receive the same response from those on his own front bench as he will receive from i as i have already say to the house a ceasefire be simply impractical because we have to have side that be willing to sign up to a ceasefire and there be absolutely no suggestion at any point that either of they will 
 a minister in the iranian government general ezzatollah zarghami formerly of the islamic revolutionary guard corps have tell iranian medium that this mission as the production manager of iranian make rocket be to supply those rocket to be fire into israel and hit civilian he openly tell iranian medium that he live in hamas terror tunnel for some time that be an iranian minister openly admit to have live in terrorist tunnel and supply rocket do my right hon friend share my concern about iran bankroll and arm hamas 
 yes i share that concern very much as do the government 
 on illegal settlement do not the experience of the past decade show that word have absolutely no impact on prime minister netanyahu i welcome the minister ’s announcement today that the government be examine sanction the violent illegal settler follow in america ’s footstep but why can we not have a ban on all trade between the united kingdom and the illegal settlement 
 the government have always make it absolutely clear that the settlement be illegal under international law and we will continue to make that case as forcefully as we think appropriate 
 i agree with the deputy secretary of state ’s comment on degrading hamas but do he agree that the malevolent force in the region be iran although obviously we do not want   a direct conflict with iran what more can the government do with our partner and ally to ensure that we can degrade the capacity and capability of iran to inflict the suffering that it have inflict on the region 
 my right hon friend will know that the government have be clear that measure need to be take and we have use our own military asset in this respect to make sure that the conflict do not widen we have send a very clear warning to iran in that respect along with our ally and he may rest assure that we continue to watch this issue with extreme care 
 in response to an early question the minister talk of dangerous regional escalation and the scale of the loss of life how do his government hope to prevent either and support a just and last peace without call for a ceasefire how can they claim to support a state solution when they do not recognise the state of palestine plus have never equal 
 it be i think the policy of both side of the house that we should not pursue the possibility of a ceasefire because there be no possibility for very trenchant reason that have be set out the hon lady be however right to point to the political horizon to ensure that we take advantage as soon as the moment be plausible of build a political track as part of that we be look to build palestinian state capacity we know that gaza should be under palestinian control when this be over hamas have no place in a future of gaza and we must never allow they ever to be able to entrench themselves in the civilian population again 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests what recent engagement have my right hon friend have with qatari counterpart in relation to their pivotal role as mediator between israel and hamas 
 discussion with qatari go on all the time indeed my noble friend lord ahmad the foreign office minister with responsibility for the middle east have be in qatar recently 
 the minister will have see picture of the horrific loss of life in gaza which start up again over the weekend and of half naked man be parade through the street the geneva convention prohibit turn prisoner of war into object of public curiosity he will also know of the grave concern about report of the use of rape by hamas fighter on   october all of this show that we will need a very clear mechanism for the investigation of allegation of war crime and for accountability if war crime be find to have happen will the minister set out what the uk government who have say that international law must be uphold believe that mechanism should be 
 i have a great deal of sympathy with the point that the hon lady make the british government have make it clear that all party in this terrible conflict must abide by international humanitarian law we continue to identify and look for mechanism for ensure that   there can be no impunity in that respect and that there will be transparency over the action that the force take 
 it be good to see you back in the chair mr speaker the humanitarian pause give an opportunity for the welcome release of israeli hostage however as a result of palestinian prisoner be release there be a concern that hamas be gain ground in the west bank and could end up be the major force in the whole of the area that we call palestine what effort be my right hon friend make to ensure the release of the hostage without any condition 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to focus on the terrible plight of the hostage i can not give the house a run commentary on what be happen in respect of the hostage but there have be no new development he will know that the ministry of defence be supply surveillance flight over gaza to assist in that general endeavour but he may rest assure that the plight of the hostage be at the top of our list of concern 
 the israeli defence ministry have tell the un that it must do well at deliver aid to gaza this be not a natural disaster it be deliberate military action during which israeli force have so far kill un aid staff mostly alongside their family how many more innocent people must die before member on both front benches realise the scale of the atrocity and demand a permanent ceasefire as the only way out 
 i understand the right hon lady ’s strength of feeling but she do no service to member on either front bench who have make it clear that the reason why a ceasefire would not work be know to the house and that try to secure humanitarian pause the long the well be the way to release humanitarian support to those who be suffer in the way she describe 
 the despicable action of hamas and iran be responsible for this conflict but proportionality be important in the rule of war as my right hon friend know can he explain what we be do work with our friend in the middle east to encourage a sense of proportionality in israel ’s response so that we minimise the many civilian casualty while respect their need to take military action 
 my hon friend express the balance very clearly and very well particularly in the part of his question the important point which britain make continually to israel be that its response must be proportionate and it must operate within international humanitarian law 
 we urgently need to see step towards a permanent ceasefire and an end to hostility on all side but the minister be right that neither israel nor hamas have agree to that in seek the release of hostage and know that we need to see an end to hamas ’s influence and place in gaza there ultimately need to be an   alternative to israel ’s current strategy with hospital now at break point food and medicine not get through and effectively the de development of gaza what be the government do to push for a consensus at the un and for a strategy to ensure that the international criminal court will be able to hold all party to account for their conduct 
 the hon lady make an important point about the critical need to get support into gaza yesterday truck get through and litre of fuel get through during and   december it be nothing like enough but we be do everything that we can in respect of the humanitarian effort alongside our likeminded partner to galvanise the international humanitarian community to get aid into gaza it be not an issue of get aid into the region the aid be there and there be plenty more back up to come it be about actually get it into gaza we be stretch every sinew to try to achieve an increase in humanitarian support as fast as we can 
 few would deny israel ’s right to defend itself against an internationally proscribe terrorist organisation but as a military man i do not always find it easy to reconcile that with what we be see on the ground in gaza or the broader operational nature of that campaign could the minister please assure i of the effort be conduct behind close door to ensure israeli restraint 
 my hon friend be right to underline the concern about the humanitarian casualty but as i have say repeatedly in response to this urgent question we be do everything we can to make the point that he have emphasise 
 hamas be an obstacle to peace and a state solution and they must release all hostage now while push for that as a means to further pause in hostility can the minister confirm what discussion be take place with international partner to create the condition where israel be secure and palestinians can see a path to reconstruction renewal and statehood in gaza 
 i reassure the hon lady that those discussion be indeed take place the foreign secretary be in washington dc last week and he have discussion with his counterpart the prime minister have a lengthy conversation with prime minister netanyahu on   december and at cop the prime minister meet israel qatar egypt and jordan he emphasise throughout the importance of provide a political horizon the hon lady be right to identify the set of action that be require but she may rest assure that the government be do everything we can to pursue they 
 i be profoundly disappoint by the minister ’s comment when he dismiss call for a humanitarian ceasefire as be implausible if it be so implausible can he explain why that be the position of every other country in the world with the exception of the united states of america and do he not understand that it be damage this country ’s credibility to be an honest broker in the necessary international discussion that have to follow   can he name action by his department that have be design to try to gain the trust of the palestinian people in this conflict 
 on the hon gentleman ’s last point i be in no doubt that lord cameron ’s visit to the west bank will have do just that on his point perhaps he should ask those who be advocate for a ceasefire the question that i have seek to answer how can there be a ceasefire when neither party to the military action would be willing to accept 
 since the terrible attack by hamas on   october more than palestinians have be kill by illegal settler in the west bank and there be unconfirmed report of the involvement of the israel defence forces in the violence the criterion outline who can receive arm export licence from the government include strong wording on violence against woman and child what diplomatic engagement have the minister have to ensure that any arm export from this country be not use to facilitate unlawful military activity 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to make it clear that the target killing of civilian be completely unacceptable that be why i say in response to the shadow foreign secretary that we seek not just the arrest but the prosecution and punishment of those responsible in respect of arm licence she may well know that britain have the most demanding export licence regime of any country in the world i think that can give we all confidence that those export licence be grant on the right term 
 be it not very obvious that israel be herd the entire population of gaza in a state of utter desperation and poverty with a lack of food medicine and water and with serious injury that can not be treat and that its ultimate aim be to expel the population of gaza and to reoccupy it do the minister not think it be time that we support the call for a ceasefire as every other nation in the world have do and stop be isolate in this ridiculous approach of say that somehow a ceasefire can not work we have to start somewhere to save life we have to start somewhere to prevent this catastrophe from get even bad on top of the already kill in gaza 
 i have set out what we be try to do to relieve the suffering the right hon gentleman so eloquently describe in gaza but i have to caution he that a simple call for a ceasefire be not the answer much well in the view of the government be to make it clear that humanitarian pause preferably extend humanitarian pause offer hope of the sort of relief that he and i both wish to see 
 when this terrible conflict come to an end as all war must both gaza and the west bank will require substantial investment to restore and enhance the economic wellbeing of the palestinian people what discussion be my right hon friend have with other country about how they may take a role in an economic revival of the area which could play a role in a lasting peace 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to emphasise that the economic reconstruction and rebuilding of gaza will be an essential element in any political settlement more widely as i have set out the government be try to make sure that when there be an opportunity to drive forward that political horizon that be precisely what we will do 
 i have just meet with othman a constituent from halifax who be originally from gaza and be utterly distressed about what his family back home be endure the un secretary general have declare that 
 nowhere in gaza be safe 
 for civilian we know that the aid get in be utterly insufficient and the humanitarian situation can not be address until the violence end i have hear what the minister have to say but the humanitarian pause that have be secure might have feel impossible at the start of this conflict we urge he to redouble his effort to work towards an endure humanitarian ceasefire which surely be the next logical step 
 i agree very much with the hon lady about the importance of secure a humanitarian pause that be exactly what we be do she will be please like i to hear that the united kingdom permanent representative at the united nations be on a visit to the region at this time to see among other thing how we can achieve precisely that 
 the minister talk up the uk ’s arm export licence but amnesty international have identify a particular loophole in those licence the incorporation guideline allow uk component to be send to destination for onward export to israel can he give i any assurance that unlike in and that be not happen right now 
 i have set out the fact that britain have the tough export licence and regulation anywhere in the world of course if the hon lady have any evidence of those licence be infract in some way she should bring it to the attention of the authority 
 the minister will be aware that as far back as   october the independent un commission of inquiry say 
 there be already clear evidence that war crime may have be commit in the late explosion of violence in israel and gaza and all those who have violate international law and target civilian must be hold accountable for their crime 
 as of saturday the death toll be more than people of whom nearly be woman and child and thousand more be believe to be bury under the rubble every passing day be another day of child die like so many of my vauxhall constituent who email i it be hard not to feel powerless when we watch the scale of death and destruction day after day do the minister agree that the international criminal court should be the jurisdiction that address the conduct of all party in adhere to international law 
 the government have make clear what the role and remit of the international criminal court be as the hon lady will be aware the british government be a strong supporter of the international criminal court   the situation that she describe only emphasise the requirement the demand that we achieve another humanitarian pause and be able to get deeply need humanitarian supply into gaza
