 as an mp i be especially committed to address the cost of living crisis that continue to push too many people into poverty trap by a crisis not of their own making we must lift people out of hardship ensure that everyone have access to the service they need without drain their pocket i be sure that colleague throughout the chamber will agree that the fact that over people across the uk rely on trussell trust food bank alone in be a disgrace it be a blight on our country and it must end 
 guildford be not only a historical town but a modern hub of innovation often refer to as the hollywood of the computer gaming industry and home to many high tech business at the cutting edge of envirotech defence space and more our town be a tech hub that draw on the legacy of our constituency ada lovelace the mother of computing live at horsley towers in my constituency for many year and alan turing whose genius continue to be honour through the alan turing institute at my alma mater the university of surrey have his childhood home in guildford

 slanderous 
 i stand here honour beyond belief to represent the great town of burnley padiham and brierfield town that be part of the story of our nation this be the land of dramatic sandstone avenue of hill and sky of romantic scenery in the shadow of pendle hill this be the land of regimented urban landscape of terrace top and tower nestle among chimney and waterway cushion by village farm country pub and proper pint we be england and lancastrian and we be proud 
 burnley the meadow by the brun record in the century have long be a hub of culture and commerce we have a century market the century towneley hall play and the century st peter ’s church indeed come over the moor from the wrong side of the pennines charlotte brontë visit gawthorpe hall in padiham wordsworth write of the site of pendle hill and burnley ’s most prolific poet henry houlding lead a literary renaissance for northern town in the century 
 once the epicentre of the global cotton trade the worker of our town build this country it be say at its height that burnley ’s cotton industry have clothe britain by breakfast and the rest of the world by dinner we be a birthplace of movement too suffragette such as margaret aldersley and fighter leader and thinker non conformist be we radical and reformer and once the seat of a labour leader no less in arthur henderson 
 i say all this because i want to stress that our story do not start or end with the mill loom for a long time be our tool in our hand be the industrial world make but now we be so much more we do not buy the standard story of decline we be a place determine with eye focus on the future hungry to play our part 
 by the way we have no great example of burnley endurance and enterprise than burnley football club yes sometimes in the face of emotional trauma at time extreme they be twice champion of england and time winner of the fa cup let i say i believe for the time ever in this house up the claret 
 as town we be now a thriving dynamic multicultural symbol of renewal and creativity to be make in east lancashire be to be a benchmark of quality particularly in our manufacturing aerospace science and cultural industry with world beat amazing innovative company put we on the map we be also unusual politically in that the constituency have be represent   by all major party in the past year alone although i hope to bring a very lengthy period of stability in that regard 
 burnley padiham and brierfield be so often paint as town with problem and extensive poverty which be true but to end our description there be to misunderstand our mindset our mission our sense of history and community our fight be not in trading narrative as to how we get here we have problem yes but we do not simply retreat to the warm nostalgia of our history we know that that way lie only stagnation our fight be in create solution for tomorrow less interested in rhetoric storytelling and ideology town such as mine want outcome for we ’s ability to deliver solution mean a lot more than the colour of a rosette outcome be what matter what be good be what work in our public service that mean dependable quality transparency choice the interest of user come and an approach that challenge every vest interest in the public interest 
 reflect on this mantra and the debate today i want to talk a little about our housing stock raise by my predecessor peter pike in his maiden speech of the once proud regiment sandstone avenue that i speak of early once a step up for family be now in a poor and worsen state too many of my constituent live in substandard under insulate cold and mouldy home low land value lock out investment but more critically lock out family from the decent accommodation that they deserve and write off whole community as just not worth the investment if we be to continue to thrive we need more housing new housing more social housing and a decent retrofit programme not see on a scale since the last labour government it be only through that growth that we can achieve the sort of improvement in our public service that we need that be the only way that we will attract the secure job and dynamic workforce of the future 
 too many of our young people be stick in a generational cycle of worklessness which hold back entire family because of a lack of opportunity skill connectivity and actually confidence we will only truly grow as a country when people in place like ours feel that growth touch they when prosperity reach the doorstep of our terrace when we break the cycle and say if you have the will we will give you the way no leave behind in my time here i hope to represent to the good of my ability those value and ambition 
 at this juncture as be tradition i pay tribute to my predecessor in burnley and padiham antony higginbotham and in brierfield and nelson east andrew stephenson both very decent and hard work man they campaign on many local issue in their year in this house and have many friend across the house which be testament to their character i genuinely wish they both well for the future 
 i be the great grandson of irish immigrant from dublin and across ireland who make their life in manchester i be age and of kid to a single mum when labour take office in it be because of that government that my mother be support through illness to raise we by an nhs with the time and resource to care scheme such as building schools for the future praise by my predecessor kitty ussher in her maiden speech in give i this future and i be of many we stand on the shoulder of giant in this place but i be able to climb on to those   shoulder only because of a supportive family who be watch from the gallery and the ladder that that labour government provide for kid like i and family like mine from town like mine i know that this new labour government will strive to do the same and i for be enormously proud to be a part of it 
 i start by congratulate   the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   the hon member for guildford zöe franklin my hon friend   the member for burnley oliver ryan   and   the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson   on their fantastic maiden speech it be great to start my time in this place by prove no few than colleague wrong about their constituency be the good because obviously that be an award that belong to the people of milton keynes north 
 this be such an important debate on an issue that affect many of my constituent and those of other members represent milton keynes i be glad to hear that this government will work to ensure that everyone feel safe in their home as the brother of of our brave local firefighter in milton keynes i echo the comment of many colleague who pay tribute to those in our emergency service who have deal with such incident i hope that they have to deal with far few in future 
 it be an immense honour to stand here today as the new mp for milton keynes north i be deeply privileged to represent not just the new city of milton keynes but many of the beautiful village and historic town around which it be build in my constituency lie the old market town of olney where year ago the timeless hymn amazing grace be pen there be wolverton which boast the old operational railway work in the world stony stratford where i be tell the term cock and bull story originate thankfully not something we be know for in this place and newport pagnell which for over half a century host the headquarters of aston martin 
 next week mark year since the release of the film goldfinger in which the most famous car in the world the db5 make its debut last week i have the pleasure to visit aston martin to see the home of that historic car and where some of on her majesty ’s secret service be film can i promise that my contribution in this place will have the excitement glamour and the adrenaline of those film no i can not but as the mp represent town with such fascinating past i promise that i will fight to give they all an even bright future 
 i start by pay tribute to my predecessor ben everitt he work tirelessly to try to secure a much need woman ’s and child ’s hospital for milton keynes as we now have some of the long nhs waiting list in the country it be an important campaign and i will be sure to take up its rein he also chair the all party parliamentary group for housing market and housing delivery which look at how we fix the break planning system some of the issue have be discuss today i hope that this new government take forward many of the recommendation that emerge from that work as we strive to build the new home that this country need 
 i would like to take a moment to mention my labour predecessor and friend the late brian white brian be a true champion of milton keynes he see the potential in our city long before it be fully realise and as an mp local councillor and later mayor brian be a tireless advocate for our community he be never to shy away from a hard battle as those of we who know he can attest of those battle be the successful fight to keep the law in this place write on vellum unfortunately we have since move to a compromise position where only the front cover of each act be print that way but since the only remain vellum manufacturer in the country william cowley be base in my constituency i will fight with everything i can to keep what be leave of this important year old tradition 
 as the mp for milton keynes who be bear and grow up there i would like to talk about the many man and woman who build the new town now city that i call home in particular be fred roche the man   who lead the milton keynes development corporation with a bold and uncompromise vision the mantra that everybody on that team live by be make no little plan fred be a streetfighter who more than anything else be willing to do what be need to achieve something that many other have consider impossible get money out of the treasury allegedly he insist on construct the outer road of milton keynes make it hard for the budget to be cut later a scheme that those work on hs2 wish they have think of he also once march into whitehall on christmas eve and refuse to leave until his budget be approve i just mention to the government front bench that those be tactic i will not rule out use in the future laughter 
 for member across the chamber who have shamefully not yet visit milton keynes what fred and his team build be nothing short of a masterpiece at time when family right across our country be live in substandard condition many would echo some of the comment we have hear today and many be live without even an indoor toilet milton keynes offer a beacon of hope high quality home be build for ten of thousand of new resident and at its peak family be move in every single day 
 in just a few decade what be once a vision on a planner ’s desk have transform into of the uk ’s most dynamic economic powerhouse today we be home to santander uk of the big bank in the country and red bull racing the fast formula team on the planet when i speak to aston martin last week it tell i to take out that line the city of pioneer and innovator create more start up than almost anywhere else boast a grow tech sector worth over £ and rank as of the most productive place in the country for every pound that fred do manage to squeeze out of the treasury ’s tight grasp we have repay it many many time over and while it may be know for its concrete cow it be far from a concrete jungle some of our city be comprise of green space alongside those be our beautiful lake river and canal every child include i grow up within a minute walk of a park or green space 
 it be say that plant a tree be of the great act of altruism we dig we plant a seed and with that small act we shape the world for many generation to come fred roche and the team plant more than a fair few tree in fact milton keynes boast over tree more than per person but i would argue that build a new town be an even great act of altruism fred pass away a few year before i be bear but i stand here today as a member of the generation that truly benefit from his vision thank to fred ’s design my young parent be able to scrape together enough to raise i and my brother in a spacious house with its own back garden the dream of home ownership become a reality for they provide we with the security and stability need for the good start in life the park and green space they create back then may day be enjoy by my own child 
 now i will not pretend that we do not have our share of challenge one i will work tirelessly to address in this place but milton keynes be build on that new town promise of good job public service that be   there when you need they and most importantly affordable and high quality new home it be a place that give i the opportunity so that i could day be stand here give my maiden speech in the house of commons i mention that because in my short time in politic i have notice that too often people search for excuse to oppose new development there be a view or have be a view that it be more politically convenient to be a voice that yell no rather than a voice that search for way to say yes and while the acronym nimby may be a modern invention the sentiment be not glance through hansard of the 60 and 70 we find countless example of opposition to the building of my hometown but there be consequence to that short term political thinking if it be not for fred and the milton keynes development corporation team ’s ambition back by the 1960 labour government the bed end of terrace that my brother and i grow up in would never have exist 
 as a proud son of milton keynes i can think of no mission more important for this new government than to build the new town and new home that this country need it will require we to embrace the spirit of fred roche visionary unyielde in the face of opposition and make no little plan but it will allow we to build a future where every child in britain have the opportunity to thrive in a home and a community that nurture their potential as mine do for i 
 i congratulate everyone on their maiden speech it be a privilege to follow my hon friend the members for calder valley josh fenton glynn for burnley oliver ryan for milton keynes north chris curtis and for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward and the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune for guildford zöe franklin and for chippenham sarah gibson 
 i represent the new constituency of penrith and solway which take in part of the old carlisle copeland workington and penrith and the border constituency i therefore follow some truly great parliamentarian willie whitelaw a pillar of strength behind the thatcher government david maclean lord blencathra who now excel in the tradition of likeable nuisance in the other place baroness sue hayman a champion of farming and rural affair whose skill will be put to good use on the labour benches sir tony cunningham a family friend my father a fine mentor rory stewart who now entertain member at least on the labour benches dr neil hudson who have be re elect as the member for epping forest and mark jenkinson who represent workington from to i may have profoundly disagree with he but i must confess that he work hard for his constituent i find myself slightly in awe at those member whose predecessor have disappear into the sunset i will be see mine on a regular basis but i promise to take any advice from they with grace 
 like   the hon member for epping forest dr hudson i have the privilege of represent a constituency in which i grow up my grandfather bring my family to cumbria in the 1950s and his work as an engineer see he on the platform for the opening of calder hall the world ’s full scale commercial nuclear power station my family ’s love of cumbria and the lake district have endure ever since 
 i have have the pleasure of represent my home of keswick on town and district council and more recently on the new cumberland unitary authority i step down from that council know that my former colleague will do their good to ensure that a challenging local government reorganisation be a success 
 as i begin my time in this place i leave behind my work in the electrical contracting industry and my career as a contract manager a role that see i work with many people in leasehold block management it therefore seem apt that i make my maiden speech in this important debate as a former electrician it be not lose on i that the tragic event that unfold at grenfell tower be trigger by an electrical fault it be now imperative that the sequence of event that follow set the ground for long last reform that ensure these   thing can never happen again i commend the decision to create the building safety regulator with its focus on high risk building while many member rightly push for reform of the leasehold system and extend the right to manage i hope the new regulator act as a defence against those whose only concern be keep build management cost down 
 winston churchill once say 
 if you put economist in a room you get opinion unless of they be lord keynes in which case you get opinion 
 when it come to the interpretation of british standard affect electrical safety and fire safety my view be that if you put electrician in a room you will get opinion but if you put the bill payer in the room with they you will only get the regulator should ensure that any new rule be unambiguous and can be apply consistently 
 i have hear a number of maiden speech and do not wish to get into the unwinnable debate about whose constituency be the most beautiful i will just take it as give that my constituency that take in the solway coast national landscape part of the north pennines national landscape and not least the north lake district include the borrowdale valley for which i have a deep love be undoubtedly in the top 
 however the real beauty of my constituency be not in its architecture coastline lake or hill it be in the people when i be elect as a councillor i be take aside by an experienced and recently retire parish clerk who have a message for i it be n’t politician who run thing around here it be the community she be right i be in constant awe of the tireless effort that volunteer show in my community every day the mountain rescue team who keep we safe on the fell the maryport rescue volunteer who run the independent lifeboat service on the solway coast the flood action group who hold our flood authority to account our community lead housing trust who excel in deliver home in rural community where large housing association fail the community group in ireby hesket newmarket and nenthead fundraise to save vital community facility at the heart of their village our food hub volunteer church together the lions the rotarians and all the other group that give so much they inspire i and this politician ’s job must surely be to help they flourish 
 i head back to my constituency for the conference recess know that i have many issue to tackle the old court house in cockermouth already half collapse into the river cocker lie empty with little progress be make by its owner and other authority to make it safe resident of penrith have be plague for many year by a revolting odour from a local meat rendering plant the infamous penrith pong have be particularly strong over the summer month 
 rural home many lack modern home insulation be in desperate need of government investment to help permanently bring down energy bill farmer be in despair as trade deal have fail to deliver and the department for environment food and rural affairs struggle to implement its new payment scheme the local health service be struggle to recruit the vital staff my community need to thrive i be here in their service and to rebuild broken britain just as we promise we would during the election 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i in this extremely important debate i congratulate my hon friend the members for crawley peter lamb and for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward on their touching and move speech i really be proud to be of the scottish delegate 
 in the tradition of maiden speech i begin by pay tribute to my immediate predecessor deidre brock who represent the constituency for year the woman to do so i wish she and her team well in their future endeavour i would also like to pay tribute to mark lazarowicz who represent the seat from until and who continue to advocate for human right asylum seeker and the environment 
 the newly extend boundary once again include muirhouse part of the constituency previously represent by   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine this part of the constituency hold a special place in my heart as it neighbour west pilton where i live and where my stepchildren go to school and attend greater pilton childcare centre during the 1990s it be a groundbreaking facility provide family with access to affordable flexible childcare a model that i hope we can learn from and replicate 
 when we live in west pilton our flat be riddle with damp we have to run a dehumidifier constantly and it would produce litre of water daily our child ’s health suffer and paint over black mould be normal we be lucky we be eventually able to move however the flat be still there and i would suggest that the issue remain too housing resilience must be a priority when building and retrofitting home access to safe and secure home be a fundamental right and although it be a devolved issue in scotland we must learn lesson and work together across government to deliver affordable healthy energy efficient home for all which must include the removal of unsafe cladding 
 i also place on record my sincere thank to malcolm chisholm who help we at this time he represent edinburgh north and leith in this place from to when he move to the scottish parliament before stand down in he be why i join the labour party his reputation and integrity his achievement and his passion for the people of edinburgh north and leith be rightly still recognise and indeed he remain an inspiration to i and many other in our community and beyond 
 madam deputy speaker i think the record may have to be correct as i have hear many hon member from across the house make an error by declare that their constituency be the great in the country they be of course mistaken as many of those who have already visit will know edinburgh north and leith can surely claim that accolade from our amazing   shop on princes street george street and the new st james quarter as well as our fantastic independent store we have the good retail across the country we have world class restaurant cafés and bar from the johnnie walker whisky experience which i be pleased to visit over the summer recess with my right hon friend the deputy prime minister to the lind and lime gin distiller where my right hon friend the prime minister be welcome and the port of leith distillery the country ’s vertical distillery i extend a welcome to all my hon friend to visit and join i for a dram 
 edinburgh north and leith be steep in history from calton hill to the new town another unesco world heritage site and onwards to stockbridge the home of golden wonder crisp newhaven with its harbour and proud fishing history and western harbour reclaim from the sea we be home to the royal yacht britannia and the royal botanic garden in inverleith leith link have claim to be the birthplace of golf and although the stadium be just outside the boundary the identity of our football team hibs be leith to the core i can confirm that as the song suggest there be indeed much sunshine on leith although not always on match day 
 our famous port of leith yes the bar but also the port itself have see the coming and going of ship from all over the world bring with they story good and people that have shape our identity the historic landmark remind we of our rich heritage and the importance of preserve it for the future this be evidence through our proud industrial and political history be where rose ’s lime juice be invent to prevent sailor from get scurvy and where salvesen have a whaling business in the present day our port be reinvent itself for the next generation with the green energy job of the future and with business such as vestas and nearby nova deliver wind and tidal energy 
 stitch into our community be so many site of natural beauty with the water of leith flow through the heart of our constituency and be hug by the firth of forth with the world ’s large art festival on our doorstep we house the scottish national portrait gallery leith theatre customs house north edinburgh arts edinburgh playhouse and the new dunard concert centre which be currently under construction alongside our film and music studio we be home to many author artist musician and poet i could go on and i possibly have for too long already but this be by no mean an exhaustive list and it do not even begin to recognise the wealth of talent and diversity in our community 
 i have yet to mention what make edinburgh north and leith truly great simply it be our people be elect to this house to represent my home and my community be truly the honour of my life i would like to thank everyone who trust i with their vote for those who do not i hope that during my time in this place i can evidence that i will champion our home 
 i understand that there be so much work to do to ensure that all can prosper as sadly for far too many people edinburgh be a tale of city too many have be leave behind and suffer through decade of neglect poverty remain stubbornly high and be a reality for so many child in our city food bank have become the norm where people already struggle to feed themselves struggle to feed those who have even less than they   we have a housing emergency with more than homeless people many of whom be family with small child live in hotel room with no kitchen resort to cooking meal each day from a kettle we have the scourge of addiction etch on people ’s face clear for all to see while our public service be underfunde and break our community be resilient i think of people such as pauline bowie recently honour for her work and the compassion of all the unpaid volunteer and low wag carer who work tirelessly each day for our community our strength lie in the people of edinburgh north and leith who be know for their warmth compassion and determination change people ’s life by offer hope be why this government be elect and it be why we must deliver 
 my journey start like all of we before i be bear i be bear in rottenrow maternity hospital in glasgow yes the house have not misheard i there be a maternity hospital call rottenrow when i be a baby and before i have a voice decision be make that would change and shape my life forever i be lucky then as i be now to have people who love and nurture i although my mum dad and gran be no long live they would be very proud as well as very surprised that i be in this place as i leave school at with few qualification and leave home not long after it take i many year to find my place in this world and i be so grateful for the love of my stepchildren david and zoe for zak and for my wife melanie for her love and support every day to i they be home i thank all my friend party activist colleague and love one who have support i in my life and on my journey lead to this place 
 as a child grow up in the 80 in a council house in a mining town with hindsight it seem inevitable that i would end up as a proud product of the labour and trade union movement in my work life from a youth training scheme in the city council to be a housing officer and trade unionist as well as through my voluntary work on the children ’s panel in drug and alcohol and mental health advocacy have always be my passion i have learn through life that when other give up on you it be easy to give up on yourself my promise to everyone in edinburgh north and leith be that i will not give up and i will fight for everyone ’s right to thrive i will be their voice in this place and as be leith ’s motto i will always persevere 
 may i associate myself with the previous remark regard the grenfell disaster and send my sympathy to all those affect 
 i congratulate all the other member on their eloquent and informative maiden speech especially my hon friend   the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert with whom i will happily share probably more than a dram of whisky as we argue over the place for good constituency which be obviously isle of wight west 
 i pay tribute to annie caddick who win silver in the mixed double scull at the paralympics we be all very proud of she i also pay tribute to my predecessor   bob seely for his year of service to the isle of wight as mp for the then large constituency in the country his interest in all thing chinese and russian be legendary on the island 
 my dad be not a toolmaker but he be a conservative councillor hon member ooh i have get the sympathy of everyone now apart from those on the conservative benches while we do not agree on politic he and my mum ’s many year as councillor do teach i that politics be about service it be also the reason i be stand on this side of the chamber although there be rather more room on the opposition benches on most day my grandad dennis a lifelong labour supporter would be very proud that i be stand on this side 
 from be the large constituency the isle of wight be now of the small constituency isle of wight west and isle of wight east i stand here as the very proud member for isle of wight west and the ever labour mp to represent the island i look forward to work with my colleague   the hon member for isle of wight east joe robertson   to improve the life of all islander although it would appear he have get the early ferry home today so he be ahead of i 
 it turn out that the island be pretty good at first in freshwater resident robert hooke develop hooke ’s law of elasticity in the uk ’s amusement park open at blackgang chine and be still open today albeit for those who know it much small as it be slip into the sea that be not part of the attraction by the way marconi establish the wireless station on the island in and saunders roe build the ever hovercraft in east cowes in we still have a hovercraft service to this day 
 the isle of wight festival be in but in the crowd be so large that the following year an act of parliament be pass ban such large scale gathering the consumer electric car the enfield be build in cowes in year old daisy morris discover a new specie of dinosaur not in the council but actually on atherfield beach know as the pterosaur we even have our prize win alpaca name hip hip hooray at west wight alpacas i be also the owner of a chip shop to become an mp hon member ah there will be free pickle egg for hon member when they come to the island

 when i make it to this place isle of wight west be refer to along with many other as a bonus seat that appear to be code for oh fffair play you won!”—but we win due to the hard work over the past year of volunteer return i as the only labour councillor and now the labour mp for the island i would like to thank every single of they but special thank must go to my agent phil attfield whose commitment be to none extra special thank must go to my wife leah and my child and grandchild for their unwavering support and for put up with i over the last few year 
 as rosy a picture as i paint of our wonderful island and how much we contribute to british life we have all the same problem as coastal and rural town include poor access to nhs dentistry gps and adult social care send education in crisis and a severe lack of secure and adequate home those problem be exacerbate by our be an island imagine be charge between £ and £ every time you drive to a neighbouring county travel from derby to nottingham from southampton to salisbury or from oxford to aylesbury would become prohibitive 
 ferry travel across the solent have become unreliable and ferociously expensive in the last few year so much so that it be now a barrier to opportunity have to rely on expensive privately run ferry mean that school trip do not happen and nhs appointment on the mainland be miss or patient be so worried that they travel the night before and pay for a hotel my predecessor mention ferry time in year but ferry be such a huge issue to i and my constituent i be guess my hon friend have not realise this!—that i have promise to mention ferry and cross solent ferry travel at every opportunity regardless of the topic i might even get past time in this speech laughter i hope the house forgive i if i do 
 i be a husband dad grandad walker of our dog and an enthusiastic visitor to island pub my focus while in this place will be on find solution to the issue that i have outline my job as mp be to champion the island in this house to ensure that i represent all my constituent and that the island be no long a forget outpost and get its fair share of support from my government as well as action on ferry laughter i extend a warm invitation to everyone on the estate to visit the isle of wight and i make a plea to ministers to visit 
 i spend some time in the few week talk to the doorkeepers and security and restaurant staff i explain that i find this place to be of the friendly workplace i have ever step foot in bear in mind i be self employ the response be that this have change as a workplace very recently when ask   how recently they all reply the of july i be extremely proud to stand here today with my colleague as part of a labour government dedicate to service and i look forward to be part of a government who build a future for the isle of wight and the country 
 we be take every step we can in relation to the steel industry because it be vital that we give it the support that it need we need steel in this country we need to steel make in this country and our plan and our mission mean that we be go to need more steel not less it be the duty of the government to ensure that job community and people be not ignore in the transition and that job be protect the business secretary will provide an update to the house this afternoon 
 i be grateful for that kind offer of course i will readily accept a visit to burnley perhaps through the lens of my role as the local growth and town minister we could have a very interesting visit and i would be glad to do it 
 i be conscious of the time i be go to run out of it unthinkably we may have to pick up any further intervention in a different form because i want to get to the point about building insurance lending and service charge raise by my hon friend the members for runcorn and helsby mike amesbury for eltham and chislehurst and for newcastle under lyme adam jogee 
 thing we know be that there have not be enough change in this space over the past year but there have be change in the insurance bill that many leaseholder have be face we understand the financial and emotional impact that extreme insurance premium have be have on leaseholder affected leaseholder have be burden with pay too high premium for too long i assure colleague that we be work actively to reduce premium for leaseholder and we be review how well to protect leaseholder from cost and push for fair premium for leaseholder in building with fire safety issue 
 colleague have talk about buying sell or remortgage home we have see improvement in that space but we remain vigilant we will continue to hold particularly the large lender to account follow their commitment to lend on property even where remediation be not yet complete they must keep that promise 
 on service charge by law variable service charge must be reasonable as colleague have raise that have be stretch significantly by some of the practice we have see the leasehold and freehold reform act contain measure to ensure that leaseholder get key financial and non financial information so that they can scrutinise and hold to account the organisation that they be work with on service charge not all of that legislation have be commence secondary legislation be require but we be work on that actively we just want to get it right 
 my hon friend   the member for read central matt rodda   talk about the pace of remediation again we accept that the pace be too slow we have say that throughout and what we have see in dagenham and slough be horrific reminder of the risk that unsafe clad still pose to far too many people the deputy prime minister have be very clear on her intention to drive that forward again there be that political will and to get more action out of manufacturer freeholder developer and organisation with responsibility for make sure that building be safe too many building owner be still not act quickly enough so we will investigate pursue the most egregious actor who be create unacceptable delay and hold they to account the message from this dispatch box and from this government be clear use the route we have create to get your building fix and get on with it 
 i now turn to the point make by   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   and   the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana   about the inquiry the right hon gentleman express concern that the report would be shelve and the hon lady be concerned that it would just be word so again let i make the commitment this speak to the response i give to my hon friend   the member for brent west barry gardiner that the report ’s recommendation must be consider with the seriousness that this tragedy deserve we will look at all recommendation in detail there will be a debate on the floor of this house we will respond in full within month and we will be listen to the community throughout the process we will update parliament annually on our progress so that we can be hold to account but we will also get on quickly with the thing we can do whether that be speed up remediation or reform construction product the change have not be at the pace that it ought to have be but it will get well i can commit that the report will not as the right hon gentleman have say just be shelve far from it 
 the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton and for woking mr forster mention building under metre our approach to clad remediation have be to prioritise the risk of loss of life it be generally accept that the risk to life be proportional to the height of building so the risk to life be usually low in building under metre and they be very unlikely to need the same costly remediation build safety remediation work may be require in a very small   number of those building but so far our casework as a department over the past couple of year show that of the more than case that have be raise only have fall into that category as such we think that be an appropriate distinction to draw 
 my hon friend   the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman   make a point about raac this issue be different in scotland than it be in england scotland have its own responsibility which the scottish government must work within and as i say to my hon friend we will work within the good practice too it be the duty of building owner include local authority if they be the owner to fulfil their duty to manage building safety and performance risk of all kind include raac in a proportionate manner 
 the shadow minister   the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds talk about personal evacuation plan or peep we must ensure that the most vulnerable in our society be protect on   september through a write ministerial statement the government announce that the home office will bring forward in the autumn proposal to improve fire safety and the evacuation of disabled or vulnerable resident in high rise and high risk residential building in england those proposal will be call residential peep through they resident with disability and impairment will be entitle to a person centre risk assessment to identify the appropriate equipment and adjustment to aid their fire safety and evacuation as well as a residential peep statement that say what vulnerable resident should do in the event of a fire the government have commit funding next year to begin that important work by support social housing provider to deliver peep for their renter 
 the shadow minister also mention product hallmark we stand by what be say in the write ministerial statement i would have hop that give enough confidence but for clarity this be about strong standard not weak standard i hope the hon gentleman can take confidence from that 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i in this extremely important debate i congratulate my hon friend the members for crawley peter lamb and for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward on their touching and move speech i really be proud to be of the scottish delegate 
 in the tradition of maiden speech i begin by pay tribute to my immediate predecessor deidre brock who represent the constituency for year the woman to do so i wish she and her team well in their future endeavour i would also like to pay tribute to mark lazarowicz who represent the seat from until and who continue to advocate for human right asylum seeker and the environment 
 the newly extend boundary once again include muirhouse part of the constituency previously represent by   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine this part of the constituency hold a special place in my heart as it neighbour west pilton where i live and where my stepchildren go to school and attend greater pilton childcare centre during the 1990s it be a groundbreaking facility provide family with access to affordable flexible childcare a model that i hope we can learn from and replicate 
 when we live in west pilton our flat be riddle with damp we have to run a dehumidifier constantly and it would produce litre of water daily our child ’s health suffer and paint over black mould be normal we be lucky we be eventually able to move however the flat be still there and i would suggest that the issue remain too housing resilience must be a priority when building and retrofitting home access to safe and secure home be a fundamental right and although it be a devolved issue in scotland we must learn lesson and work together across government to deliver affordable healthy energy efficient home for all which must include the removal of unsafe cladding 
 i also place on record my sincere thank to malcolm chisholm who help we at this time he represent edinburgh north and leith in this place from to when he move to the scottish parliament before stand down in he be why i join the labour party his reputation and integrity his achievement and his passion for the people of edinburgh north and leith be rightly still recognise and indeed he remain an inspiration to i and many other in our community and beyond

 i have yet to mention what make edinburgh north and leith truly great simply it be our people be elect to this house to represent my home and my community be truly the honour of my life i would like to thank everyone who trust i with their vote for those who do not i hope that during my time in this place i can evidence that i will champion our home

 as a child grow up in the 80 in a council house in a mining town with hindsight it seem inevitable that i would end up as a proud product of the labour and trade union movement in my work life from a youth training scheme in the city council to be a housing officer and trade unionist as well as through my voluntary work on the children ’s panel in drug and alcohol and mental health advocacy have always be my passion i have learn through life that when other give up on you it be easy to give up on yourself my promise to everyone in edinburgh north and leith be that i will not give up and i will fight for everyone ’s right to thrive i will be their voice in this place and as be leith ’s motto i will always persevere 
 i start by congratulate   the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   the hon member for guildford zöe franklin my hon friend   the member for burnley oliver ryan   and   the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson   on their fantastic maiden speech it be great to start my time in this place by prove no few than colleague wrong about their constituency be the good because obviously that be an award that belong to the people of milton keynes north

 it be an immense honour to stand here today as the new mp for milton keynes north i be deeply privileged to represent not just the new city of milton keynes but many of the beautiful village and historic town around which it be build in my constituency lie the old market town of olney where year ago the timeless hymn amazing grace be pen there be wolverton which boast the old operational railway work in the world stony stratford where i be tell the term cock and bull story originate thankfully not something we be know for in this place and newport pagnell which for over half a century host the headquarters of aston martin 
 next week mark year since the release of the film goldfinger in which the most famous car in the world the db5 make its debut last week i have the pleasure to visit aston martin to see the home of that historic car and where some of on her majesty ’s secret service be film can i promise that my contribution in this place will have the excitement glamour and the adrenaline of those film no i can not but as the mp represent town with such fascinating past i promise that i will fight to give they all an even bright future 
 i start by pay tribute to my predecessor ben everitt he work tirelessly to try to secure a much need woman ’s and child ’s hospital for milton keynes as we now have some of the long nhs waiting list in the country it be an important campaign and i will be sure to take up its rein he also chair the all party parliamentary group for housing market and housing delivery which look at how we fix the break planning system some of the issue have be discuss today i hope that this new government take forward many of the recommendation that emerge from that work as we strive to build the new home that this country need 
 i would like to take a moment to mention my labour predecessor and friend the late brian white brian be a true champion of milton keynes he see the potential in our city long before it be fully realise and as an mp local councillor and later mayor brian be a tireless advocate for our community he be never to shy away from a hard battle as those of we who know he can attest of those battle be the successful fight to keep the law in this place write on vellum unfortunately we have since move to a compromise position where only the front cover of each act be print that way but since the only remain vellum manufacturer in the country william cowley be base in my constituency i will fight with everything i can to keep what be leave of this important year old tradition 
 as the mp for milton keynes who be bear and grow up there i would like to talk about the many man and woman who build the new town now city that i call home in particular be fred roche the man   who lead the milton keynes development corporation with a bold and uncompromise vision the mantra that everybody on that team live by be make no little plan fred be a streetfighter who more than anything else be willing to do what be need to achieve something that many other have consider impossible get money out of the treasury allegedly he insist on construct the outer road of milton keynes make it hard for the budget to be cut later a scheme that those work on hs2 wish they have think of he also once march into whitehall on christmas eve and refuse to leave until his budget be approve i just mention to the government front bench that those be tactic i will not rule out use in the future laughter 
 for member across the chamber who have shamefully not yet visit milton keynes what fred and his team build be nothing short of a masterpiece at time when family right across our country be live in substandard condition many would echo some of the comment we have hear today and many be live without even an indoor toilet milton keynes offer a beacon of hope high quality home be build for ten of thousand of new resident and at its peak family be move in every single day 
 in just a few decade what be once a vision on a planner ’s desk have transform into of the uk ’s most dynamic economic powerhouse today we be home to santander uk of the big bank in the country and red bull racing the fast formula team on the planet when i speak to aston martin last week it tell i to take out that line laughter the city of pioneer and innovator create more start up than almost anywhere else boast a grow tech sector worth over £ and rank as of the most productive place in the country for every pound that fred do manage to squeeze out of the treasury ’s tight grasp we have repay it many many time over and while it may be know for its concrete cow it be far from a concrete jungle some of our city be comprise of green space alongside those be our beautiful lake river and canal every child include i grow up within a minute walk of a park or green space 
 it be say that plant a tree be of the great act of altruism we dig we plant a seed and with that small act we shape the world for many generation to come fred roche and the team plant more than a fair few tree in fact milton keynes boast over tree more than per person but i would argue that build a new town be an even great act of altruism fred pass away a few year before i be bear but i stand here today as a member of the generation that truly benefit from his vision thank to fred ’s design my young parent be able to scrape together enough to raise i and my brother in a spacious house with its own back garden the dream of home ownership become a reality for they provide we with the security and stability need for the good start in life the park and green space they create back then may day be enjoy by my own child 
 now i will not pretend that we do not have our share of challenge one i will work tirelessly to address in this place but milton keynes be build on that new town promise of good job public service that be   there when you need they and most importantly affordable and high quality new home it be a place that give i the opportunity so that i could day be stand here give my maiden speech in the house of commons i mention that because in my short time in politic i have notice that too often people search for excuse to oppose new development there be a view or have be a view that it be more politically convenient to be a voice that yell no rather than a voice that search for way to say yes and while the acronym nimby may be a modern invention the sentiment be not glance through hansard of the 60 and 70 we find countless example of opposition to the building of my hometown but there be consequence to that short term political thinking if it be not for fred and the milton keynes development corporation team ’s ambition back by the 1960 labour government the bed end of terrace that my brother and i grow up in would never have exist 
 as a proud son of milton keynes i can think of no mission more important for this new government than to build the new town and new home that this country need it will require we to embrace the spirit of fred roche visionary unyielde in the face of opposition and make no little plan but it will allow we to build a future where every child in britain have the opportunity to thrive in a home and a community that nurture their potential as mine do for i

 i thank my right hon friend for begin to deliver fund to support business confidence and provide a safety net for worker will she explain how that will support worker who be deal with great uncertainty 
 the fund that have be announce be specifically for people in business and in the supply chain because we know that they have already be affect by the uncertainty of the situation at port talbot they will help people to retrain and reskill into new employment and will help business to diversify and go into new market if they be a primary customer of tata steel 
 i know that my right hon friend will serve wales admirably in her new role 
 llanwern steelwork in newport be a key strategic site that manufacture world class automotive steel and more and it have so much potential we all await the statement later but can she outline what she have be do alongside the department for business and trade to secure future investment in llanwern as part of ongoing discussion with tata

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 today the government be expect to unveil detail of their steel plan for south wales from what have be brief to the press it seem that the new deal be at its core the same deal worth hundred of million of pound that be agree by the last conservative government at the time the secretary of state and the welsh labour party appear to rubbish the deal and suggest that a well be possible do she now regret the labour party ’s previous criticism of the deal 
 i do not recognise that characterisation of the deal on which the business secretary will make a statement later he will make that statement to the house i do not want to pre empt it because we be a party and a government who will always come to the house to make major announcement but i be confident that he will set out a sustainable future for steelmaking in port talbot in wales and across the uk 
 the fact remain that key part of the deal as it appear in the press appear to be largely unchanged from what be agree before include almost £ to help steelworker who might lose their job in its negotiation with the last government tata steel be crystal clear that no other deal be possible move forward it be crucial that fund to help retrain those who will lose their job reach they swiftly so will the secretary of state lie out the detail of how and when the money will be send to those impact 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer we have the transition board in place for nearly month under the last government and not a single penny go out the door to business or worker affect within week of my taking over chairmanship of the transition board £ have be release to help supply chain business and worker that be the tranche with further fund to come

 this government be elect on a manifesto that stress a partnership approach with local authority and an intention to stabilise the funding system move away from wasteful competition those be the principle we will seek to apply as we think about the future of local growth funding as with all government decision regard funding beyond march it be ultimately a matter for the spending review 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee
