i have recently be contact by constituent about the imminent closure of the hall a small community space in east village stratford of very few in the area as we know such space be absolutely invaluable ours host load of event include meeting of the brownies and the girl guides i be make representation to get living the developer responsible for that decision it have frankly be responsible for a whole bunch of questionable decision over recent year include during the clad scandal and on exorbitant service change can we have a debate in government time on how the action of developer have undermine the olympic legacy and fail local resident 
 we have see many injustice debate in this house just today we have see the injustice of the waspi woman in recent week we have speak about the infected blood scandal and more recently the post office scandal tonight we be go to debate another scandal the mineworker pension scheme scandal 
 some of the united kingdom be on top of old coalmine so i have hop that of this chamber would be full tonight but it be not maybe there be a few reason for that the issue have be debate a lot in this place both before and since i come into parliament so maybe certain mp be get a bit feed up of say the same old thing but we will keep try 
 i start in the pit in the mid-1980 i go to work at sutton colliery in north nottinghamshire with my dad paul anderson he be a rope fitter and i go to work with he underground i have a good time work with my dad and my friend at sutton colliery which be a family pit it be a small coalmine with small coal seam and difficult condition it be a family pit where brother work with their brother dad and grandad it be a proper community but like all coalmine there be tragedy underground at sutton colliery in there be a methane explosion and sadly man lose their life i know some of the friend family and descendant of the people who die 
 i then go on to cresswell colliery in north derbyshire to do my coalface training it be another family pit where again man work with their son and brother work with their brother and it too be ting with tragedy in there be a fire at cresswell colliery and sadly man and boy lose their life the mine rescuer have to seal the pit off underground to save the colliery so that it could produce coal again they seal off some of the old working and leave the man inbye because there be no chance of save they but when they take the stop down just a few month later the man be on the other side some of they have scratch their name into the wall it be terrible and this sort of thing be hard to explain to people who have not work down a coalmine it be a very tight knit community and people work in difficult condition 
 i have just over year of work in awful condition but my grandad charlie have year down the coalmine and finish up at norton hill colliery it would have be year but he take a break between and and go to fight hitler then he come back and go straight back down the pit the follow week when he finish in the pit in he get a tankard   a certificate quid and a meagre pension imagine that 
 as miner we know about the risk underground when we go down the pit every day since mining start in this country in the 1600 over man woman and child have die in the coalmine so we know the risk we know there be always a chance that something might happen but these be the risk we take the miner take these risk for simple reason to earn a wage put food on the table and make sure their   kid be well dressed in when i be still work in the pit they be privatise in my area it be rj budge mining that take over the pit 
 at that time a big bone of contention be what be go to happen with the mps or the mineworker pension scheme it be probably of the rich pension scheme in the world at that time and be worth hundred of million if not billion in today ’s money it be always accept that there would be a 70:30 split in favour of the miner when the then government sit around the table with the trustee to make an offer to guarantee the mineworker pension scheme we automatically surmise that there would be a 70:30 split which would have be fair but at the last minute it end up be and depend on who you talk to whether it be the trustee at the time or the mining organisation involve in campaigning nobody can get to the bottom of it a take it or leave it   50:50 deal 
 the government at the time never undertake a proper financial risk assessment or have actuarial advice on the split we can never get to the bottom of that it be a simple take it or leave it when i be work at the pit with my friend we never really have a say in this i can not remember any man i work with underground be happy with the 50:50 split because we know how rich the pension fund be 
 year on from successive labour and conservative governments have not pay a single penny into the pension scheme which be a cash cow they have take £ out of the scheme some mining group say the sum be near to £ but i will take the figure i have here in just the last year the government have take more than £ out of the surplus which be a lot of money this be miner money 
 in effect the treasury ’s guarantee be an insurance scheme it guarantee to make up the shortfall and pay the bonus and so on if there be not a surplus but i can not think of any insurance scheme anywhere in this country or the world that have never have to pay out in year not a penny have come from the treasury or the taxpayer to top up the mineworker pension scheme i think that be a bit of a scandal and so do my mining community 
 if i may i will answer that in a moment because i will now turn back to the report in lay the report before parliament the ombudsman bring matter to the house ’s attention make it clear that parliament have a role in respond to the report the government intend to engage fully and constructively with parliament i view this debate as a crucial part of that process 
 i remind the house about what the ombudsman ’s report say and indeed do not say the ombudsman have look not at the decision to equalise the state pension age but rather at how that decision be communicate by the dwp that be important to understand as the motion call on the government to 
 deliver prompt compensation to woman bear in the 1950 who have their state pension age raise 
 importantly the ombudsman ’s report hint at the department ’s decision over a narrow period between and and their effect on individual notification the ombudsman have not find that woman have directly lose out financially as a result dwp action the report state 
 we do not find that it 
 the dwp ’s communication 
 result in they suffer direct financial loss 
 the final report do not say that all woman bear in the 1950 will have be adversely impact as many woman be aware that the state pension age have change the stage report find that between and the dwp ’s communication of change to the state pension age reflect the standard that the ombudsman would expect it to meet that report also confirm that accurate information about change to the state pension age be publicly available in leaflet through the dwp pension education campaign and dwp agency and on its website however when consider the department ’s action between august and december the ombudsman come to the view that they result   in 1950 bear woman receive individual notice later than they might have do have different decision be make 
 i welcome the wide range contribution from member on behalf of their constituent 
 before we begin today ’s proceeding i would like to make a short statement on monday night the house agree a new policy base on a report of the house of commons commission set out the step that can be take if a member be arrest on suspicion of commit a violent or sexual offence this involve a risk assessment carry out by a panel which may recommend that a member be exclude from the parliamentary estate more detail of the policy be available on the house of commons commission ’s webpage 
 as the house know the main motion as amend be agree to without a division no member vote against the exclusion policy however i understand that some hon member have receive threat on social medium since the vote on monday let i be quite clear any attempt to intimidate or threaten any member of this house be totally and wholly unacceptable it be an affront to our democracy and to the constituent who elect we and it be a contempt of this house 
 any member who receive threaten communication should report they to the parliamentary security department and if appropriate to the police through the parliamentary liaison and investigations team which will be able to investigate far i write to all hon member last night to remind they of the support service available to member we take this very seriously 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 be it relevant to what i have just say 
 it be mr speaker give that our legal system have in build safeguard to protect the right of the accuse and that we in this place promote and defend these right on behalf of our constituent be it not absolutely in order for this house to debate the extent of these right in relation to the exclusion of member of parliament from this chamber and the estate before they have either be convict or discharge by the court 
 it be absolutely right that this house should have an opportunity to debate and vote on these matter as it do on monday night i will leave it at that 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help improve the reliability of rail service for passenger 
 what step he be take to help improve the reliability of rail service for passenger 
 performance vary across the network and be dependent on both reliable infrastructure and strong operator performance where we have both as on greater anglia passenger enjoy great performance and i be clear that this be a standard for all operator to achieve work with their network rail route counterpart i regularly meet network rail and train operator to encourage great collaboration on day to day performance include convene a rail industry summit in march 
 with fare up and cancellation at a record high rail passenger be cry out for change in my patch reddish south and denton station be serve by just train a week i would like a train service that meet our need but the minister seem to have put rail reform on the back burner be that because he can not deliver or he think labour will 
 the hon member be completely wrong the pre legislative scrutiny of the draft rail reform bill be be do right now by the transport committee i think i be the final witness to appear before the committee next week so that it can i hope report in july contrast that with the passenger in chief approach of meddle with the railway and indeed of a resource lead timetable to fit the exist staff and i think it be quite clear that it be the conservatives who want to improve the rail system 
 summer have arrive and ten of thousand of visitor will be head to chester and north wales and cross border connectivity be essential i remind the minister of his government ’s cast iron commitment make in october to electrify the north wales main line when will the north wales main line actually receive an allocation of real money so it can start work on the electrification of the line 
 the hon member be absolutely correct that the prime minister ’s network north commitment mean over £ of former hs2 money be be put into other project chiefly in the north and the midland the electrification of the north wales main line be of those and it be something i be determined we will deliver we be take step in allocate project   time and resource so that we can advance such project but bear in mind that the hs2 spend be for up to so it will not all come at once 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 be it the case that train operate company stand ready to invest significantly to improve passenger journey but a disincentive be the break clause in current contract ahead of wide reform that the transport committee be scrutinise at the moment may i urge the minister to review those break clause arrangement and incentivise that investment now 
 this be the folly of labour ’s nationalisation plan because the good perform operator in term of punctuality be greater anglia and that have the option that be come up the labour party if it make it into government would take away the contract from the operator that have the good performance show that it be all about dogma and not about good common sense i firmly believe that where operator can deliver more for passenger and indeed for their workforce by have more certainty there be certainly a case to be make for look at those contract term and give they long 
 my hon friend know that after decade of closure kenilworth station have be reopen by a conservative government and a conservative county council however the reliability indeed the variety of service through that station would be significantly improve by double track the line between leamington and coventry i be grateful to the secretary of state for the time he have already give i on this issue but will my hon friend do all he can to bring about that improvement which will benefit not just my constituent but also provide connectivity option that the northern leg of high speed no long will 
 my right hon and learn friend have be a champion of that project and as he mention he meet the secretary of state to discuss it hs2 be make provision for the project to occur should funding be available and the new local transport fund make fund available for those part where hs2 would previously have be deliver there be now a great opportunity for my right hon and learn friend ’s transport authority to fund the project that he have champion for so long 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in the year since the government admit that reform of our railway be need passenger service have go from bad to bad with a train now cancel every second the bad statistic on record with the transport secretary openly admit that any reform this side of an election be unlikely do the minister understand why passenger have give up on this government do anything to improve their rail experience 
 i do not agree with that assertion post privatisation nationalisation would reverse this passenger number have double and £ have be invest in the railway by this government since   we look at performance which of course we want to get well but in march for example of train be run to time with of cancellation the big cancellation failure during march be trespass and suicide and the trespass alone cause cancellation yes there be more we need to do but the opposition front bench team would have a lot more credibility if they recognise performance indicator and what part we need to deliver rather than just chuck dogma about nationalisation which be a tired fail old policy 
 whether his department provide grant for the provision of training for d1 licence 
 although we do not provide direct funding for driver to obtain d1 licence the department make available more than £ a year through the bus service operator grant to community transport operator in england which be predominantly charity operating vehicle that require d1 licence they receive £ for every £ claim reflect the increase cost face by the sector and support they to continue deliver inclusive and accessible transport across the country 
 i thank the minister for that answer in scotland as across the rest of the uk there have be a shortage of minibus driver with brexit and the legacy of covid fuel a crippling shortage of bus driver passenger carry vehicle driver can pursue career in various field include public transport tour and travel company school transportation and private charter service what more can the government do to incentivise such training 
 the hon gentleman might not be aware of the recent consultation to reduce the age requirement for bus and hgv driver from to and i encourage he to speak to the department for work and pensions we be work closely with the relevant ministers at dwp to have sector base work academy and skill boot camp to encourage great participation by driver 
 if he will fund exploratory rail study on passenger number through the local transport fund 
 the local transport fund be a £ fund that have be allocate to local authority in the north and midland to fund a wide range of transport measure the funding empower local leader to invest in the transport policy that matter most to people in their area and that could include rail study guidance will be publish shortly to support local leader in develop their plan but it will rightly be a local decision 
 may i congratulate my hon friend on the award of £ to the east riding to improve transport whether that be pothole bus   shelter or whatever else in beverley and holderness the minister be aware of my championing alongside labour colleague liberal democrat colleague and the council across the whole area of the reopening of the hull to york line through beverley i be delighted to hear he confirm today that that funding can be use to explore and produce a refined demand model for that railway will he confirm that 
 my right hon friend be indeed a great champion for this scheme which we have discuss many time i be pleased to confirm that the local transport fund could be use to develop the new rail link between york and hull via beverley it be important to say that it will be for the local transport authority to decide and i encourage he to continue to engage with it our upcoming guidance will set out more detail about the scope of the ltf and i be sure he will continue with his mission to deliver 
 what step he be take to improve transport connectivity for town and city in the north west 
 before i answer my hon friend ’s question may i just welcome very strongly your statement at the beginning of business mr speaker stand up for the right of member to debate thing in this house and the importance of protect their security that be welcome and i be sure it will have be welcome by all part of the house 
 in answer to my hon friend ’s question network north will see a furth £ of investment in the north of england follow the redirection of funding from the phase of hs2 liverpool city region be of area to benefit from nearly £ of uplift in the round of the city region sustainable transport settlement a furth £ be go to the non mayoral local authority to fund a wide range of project guidance on how that should be spend will be forthcoming shortly 
 my right hon friend know how important rail connectivity be to my constituent it will be far enhance by the reconnection of the burscough curve a project that be also support by our hon friend   the member for south ribble katherine fletcher who have her own campaign for a station at midge hall give the importance of scheme that link area will he issue strong guidance for transport authority to have well link between each other rather than just within their own transport area 
 as my hon friend know i recently host a roundtable bring together he his local authority lancashire county council local rail operator and other interested party to discuss how to far develop the business case for the burscough curve he will be aware that we have allocate that money to the local transport fund lancashire county council will get £ over year start next year i suggest he continue the conversation we have have to urge the council to look at develop that scheme   we will be publish guidance encourage it to do that work with member of parliament in the very near future 
 you can think of coppull station 
 when will the secretary of state improve on the timetable at the time of gladstone 
 i be not entirely certain the rail minister my hon friend   the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman   set out clearly the improved performance that we have see this year we be clear that we be integrate track and train with our rail reform that be be scrutinise in the house and that will improve thing we have recently reorganise the department bring in alex hynes to link that together that be how we deliver improved performance we have set out those plan clearly legislation before this house be be scrutinise by the select committee of my hon friend   the member for milton keynes south iain stewart we look forward to its report which i understand we will get before the summer recess to take those plan forward 
 we welcome the £ in lancashire as you will in chorley mr speaker we have also be have discussion about what we want to see with that funding whether that be at the hare and hounds junction in clayton or just fix pothole across the constituency of the important thing in hyndburn and haslingden be make sure that our train station be accessible for everybody we currently have a few bid in include church oswaldtwistle and rishton will the secretary of state look favourably upon those bid 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for welcome the money that will go to her local authority we will make it clear in the guidance which i hope will be welcome to you as well mr speaker that local authority should very much involve their member of parliament in discuss those priority i hope that every member in the north and the midland where local authorise be get those fund will take advantage of that 
 on my hon friend ’s specific point about accessibility and our access for all programme as she know a number of bid be make and they be currently be scrutinise i hope that in the near future we will be able to set out which one will be fund i urge she to wait for that announcement i wish her good luck obviously i can not prejudge that process but i hope that she be successful 
 will the secretary of state explain why train fare have rise almost twice as fast as wage since 
 the hon lady will know that over the last year the government have make significant intervention to keep rail fare rise no fast than the rise in people ’s wage she also know that we have to balance the farebox against the taxpayer she will know that because of the pandemic the taxpayer have put in £ over a couple of year to protect the rail industry passenger figure have not yet recover to   their number beforehand that be why it be important that as soon as we can we get rail company on contract that incentivise they to drive up the number of passenger use the service which be how we will reduce the call on the taxpayer and enable fare to be keep competitive 
 what recent progress he have make on the east west rail project 
 for connection stage of east west rail i be pleased to attend an event in march to mark the completion of work on the final section of track connect bicester and bletchley with service expect to commence next year at the spring budget £ be announce to accelerate work introduce service between oxford and bedford by the end of the decade follow the announcement of the preferred route alignment between bedford and cambridge last may a statutory consultation be due to launch this summer 
 the connection of east west rail from bedford to cambridge will cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money the minister know that because he be at the transport committee sit right next to the permanent secretary when she say so although apparently that be okay because a few landowner and developer will make shedload of money out of planning gain meanwhile the late chief executive officer of east west rail have scarper because he could not stand the heat in the kitchen 
 as the minister say east west rail be progress with a statutory consultation have completely fluff the consultation by not contact the right people but hold it over the summer month while people be away all the time the project be be drive by the economic growth board in the treasury which meet secretly and tell people nothing what can the minister tell my constituent about this project 
 i thank my hon friend for his question laughter he be indeed in the same room as i be when i be with colleague this be an important aspect from the treasury and the department for levelling up as well as our permanent secretary to discuss the cross governmental co ordination that will be require to unlock all the economic benefit as he know we will not necessarily agree on this point i believe that east west rail be critical in deliver a workforce to cambridge which will allow cambridge to compete with the like of boston and city in south east asia so that those pioneer have a workforce and we can keep cambridge and indeed oxford motor on that basis 
 on that basis let we go to cambridge 
 thank you mr speaker indeed some be more positive about the improved connectivity potential in and around cambridge but the minister will be aware that his colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities recently establish the cambridge delivery group which be look to create additional home which   will in turn create a whole series of transport challenge will he tell the house what structure be in place to ensure proper dialogue between his department dluhc and east west rail 
 the east west rail growth board which as my hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller   point out be be lead by the treasury will be critical to ensure that join up approach it be essential that we look at this project as an economic opportunity for the area i have meet my hon friend ’s constituent as we have both travel around and i appreciate that there be an impact where there be housing but if we do not have a workforce cambridge and that region will not be able to compete on the global stage and we will not see the pioneer scientific and bio health development that we see from cambridge that be why i believe that this railway be critical 
 what step he be take to support bus manufacturing 
 the uk boast a strong and highly competitive bus manufacturing industry manufacturer have benefit significantly from government funding as we work with industry to decarbonise the bus fleet more than bus have be fund across the uk since february with uk bus manufacturer support many of they uk manufacturer have grow substantially in recent year as a result of their success in securing order support by £ of dedicated zebra emission bus regional area funding 
 the reality be that the uk government could do much more at tuesday ’s sitting of the transport committee mick whelan of aslef say that in germany they have german train and in italy they have italian train he say 
 before they award a government contract they look at their supply chain future apprenticeship and all the thing associate with those contract 
 why do the uk continue to destroy its own industrial base by refuse to implement similar procurement policy for all transport manufacturer include bus there be too big a reliance on chinese import 
 as i say uk bus manufacturer have do very well out of decarbonisation policy they be every competitive and i have have the opportunity in this job to visit a number of they if the hon gentleman believe that there be unfair competition from import he know that there be an independent statutory body the trade remedies authority whose responsibility it be to look at importer where there might be dump if he think there be any evidence of that by any manufacturer he should provide that evidence to the trade remedies authority so that it can conduct an investigation as appropriate 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the uk have a proud bus manufacturing history from london ’s iconic original routemaster to alexander dennis next   generation of hydrogen double decker use today in the liverpool city region as operator and local authority decarbonise their fleet uk manufacturer be ready to power that green revolution but our bus maker be at risk from cheap model import from overseas this week a major uk operator be prepare to procure chinese build bus for ten of million of pound due to cost pressure and because this government have not set out a full industrial strategy since will the secretary of state tell the house what he will do to back british bus manufacturer and secure their role in this green revolution 
 the hon gentleman will know that it be not possible give our international commitment under the world trade organisation to specify that people have to buy british bus he will also know that british bus manufacturer be very competitive the government have make support available to business through our advanced propulsion centre and uk export finance as i say to   the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown if the shadow minister think that there be any unfair competition with subsidise import the trade remedies authority have all the tool at its disposal to deal with that 
 we back british bus we have fantastic manufacturer and i have confidence in they in a fair competition our bus manufacturer can take on the world wrightbus have have £ of support from uk export finance to support its ambitious export it be a shame that he do not have the same faith in british industry that we do 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 deary i mr speaker we have confidence in the bus manufacturer and it be a pity that the government do not that be the problem unlike sulebs and scotzeb the scottish ultra low emission bus scheme and the scottish emission bus challenge fund the zebra scheme have be a failure no spin from the dispatch box can deny that and our bus manufacturer be pay the price we must learn from this and we can start by encourage those purchase emission bus to place great emphasis on social value and wide environmental and economic impact when evaluate tender the government must take responsibility will the secretary of state consider conduct a cross government review into prioritise domestic manufacturing within exist legal framework 
 people be able to put social value into their tender my understanding be that local authority do that but they be not allow to have a specific commitment to buy from a certain provision the hon gentleman have to decide whether he have confidence in our fantastic company as he set out in a fair competition some of the company that have be mention some of which i have visit can win against competitor around the world if he think that there be unfair competition and that company be be subsidise he should give the evidence to the trade remedies authority which have the legal structure and the tool to do the job 
 we ’ve have question about bus and then a come along 
 what step he be take to support local bus service 
 the government have provide over £ to support and improve bus service since march leicestershire county council receive over £ in emergency recovery funding to help maintain service during and after covid and have recently be award up to £ to deliver its bus service improvement plan 
 as the house will know the word democracy come from the greek demos mean the people and kratos mean power power to the people well the people in north west leicestershire who sign a petition for the reinstatement of the number and 29a bus service on their original route be not feel very empower despite a very well run campaign there be no movement from arriva or leicestershire county council what can the minister do to help my constituent 
 where commercial operator want to change a service as i understand happen in this community they have to work with the local authority to replace service where possible and limit disruption i would point out to the hon gentleman that leicestershire county council have also receive over £ from the rural mobility fund to trial demand responsive service and i encourage he to meet it 
 my constituent and i be extremely concerned about arriva ’s sudden proposal to close its depot in aylesbury with no warning that it be even be consider the company admit that it would mean end the vast majority of its service in our area cause huge problem for those who rely on its bus to get to school work and hospital i have demand an urgent meeting with its senior management but what can the department do to help hold arriva to account and ensure aylesbury resident have the bus service they need and deserve 
 i be aware of this problem which have recently come to light i would certainly encourage a meeting between the local authority the bus company and my hon friend and i will assist he in any way in that respect i be aware that some local operator in the form of carousel buses and the oxford bus company be run some of the service but i accept that there be an issue in aylesbury and i will help he on an ongoing basis 
 if he will have discussion with a airbus and b boeing on air safety 
 both i and departmental official engage proactively with industry include boeing airbus and other manufacturer on aviation safety the civil   aviation authority the independent safety regulator for the aviation sector also engage regularly across the industry i should point out that we have some of the safe sky in the world the fatal accident rate of uk airline be among the low in europe and the world we have not have a single fatal accident involve commercial passenger airplane for more than year i be determined that that safety record will continue 
 the minister might know that i be the chair of a manufacturing group for members of parliament airbus rolls royce and boeing be amazing manufacturer at the heart of our manufacture economy but do he agree that we must sort out the problem that seem to have occur in the manufacture of boeing ’s max do he agree that the fast our regulator work with american regulator to sort this out the well for british job and british innovation 
 i absolutely agree with the hon member that they be amazing company with huge operation in the uk and enviable safety record not of the boeing max 9s operate globally operate in the uk or from the uk so there be no need to ground they the department for transport liaise closely with american authority the caa follow very closely the work of the us federal aviation administration to ensure that safety standard remain as high as possible 
 what recent discussion he have have with helicopter search and rescue operator on the adequacy of response time 
 the right hon member will be aware that the maritime and coastguard agency be conduct an analysis of recent incident datum to examine whether the demand for the search and rescue helicopter service have change since the launch of the uk ’s generation search and rescue aviation procurement it be expect to be publish by the end of i have have no recent discussion on this point as the review be ongoing 
 i thank the minister for his answer he seem to be aware of the situation but a new threat to search and rescue response time be emerge namely the poor and deteriorate industrial relation between bristow ’s management and its staff as we speak member of the british airline pilots association who work in sar cohort be on strike have be drive to it by a management who be play negotiate hardball on salary and on term and condition will the minister call in the management and make it clear to they that as the customer the government expect they to treat their search and rescue staff with the respect and consideration that their skill and bravery deserve 
 i know how important search and rescue service be in the right hon gentleman ’s constituency and he have be a great champion for they good industrial relation be clearly vital to ensure that they operate effectively and i be sure that the mca will keep that in mind during its review i should add that just this morning i agree to meet the management of bristow 
 what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing 
 what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing 
 the government be firmly on the side of driver which be why we be use funding reallocate from the hs2 programme to improve the condition of the country ’s local highway network our record funding increase of £ for local highway maintenance in england over the next decade will enable highway authority to resurface road and fix thousand of pothole across the country 
 the secretary of state and his ministers be well aware of my campaign for the removal of the concrete surface of the a180 it be now year since i receive a letter from the then road minister tell i that the work would be complete by the end of can the secretary of state tell i when work will begin to remove that concrete surface and make the road much safe than it be at present can he give i a firm date 
 my understanding be that the a180 be part of the national highways concrete road programme and that there be a plan to undertake additional treatment to reduce noise substantially early in the next road investment period which start next year my hon friend may wish to meet the road minister to discuss the matter in more detail and secure some specific information about the timing 
 as my right hon friend know shropshire ’s road network be the long in all the english local authority area last autumn he make a welcome announcement about a significant increase in funding—£150 to repair and improve road and he make another in february about the hs2 reallocation of £ will he explain to i and to other shropshire members what that will mean in practical term for the amount to be spend on road during the next parliament 
 my right hon friend be correct shropshire county council will receive pot of money a minimum uplift of £ from to for highway maintenance and a furth £ under the new local transport fund start next year and continue for year those figure represent a significant increase on what the council would otherwise have receive we will provide more detail shortly about the guidance on how the money should be use and as i have say in response to early question member of parliament will be involve in set those priority 
 somerset be unfortunately home to ten of thousand of pothole persistent flooding make the problem bad but so do the lack of attention give to improve the resilience of our road do the secretary of state recognise the importance of future proof they with specific fund   for local authority to spend on measure of that kind as oppose to pothole funding that serve only as a temporary sticking plaster 
 i be pleased that the hon lady have ask that question because i absolutely do part of our purpose in not only give local authority that significant funding increase but spread it over year so that they have certainty over a long period be to enable they to move away from deal with pothole filling and to embark on a proper road resurfacing programme that funding will pay for the resurfacing of more than mile of road thus deliver to the hon lady ’s constituent the improvement that we all want to see 
 resident in west fenham recently say to i that car mechanic must be the main beneficiary of conservative transport policy give the steady flow of work for they cause by the terrible state of the road a local authority survey say that the road be in their bad condition for year and aa call out be at a year high how can the secretary of state possibly say that he be on the side of driver when the road be in such a terrible condition 
 the hon lady have just demonstrate why our decision to allocate a very significant and unprecedented increase in spending to improve local highway maintenance be exactly the right thing to do i have notice that my local authority be busy resurface road across my constituency and the rest of gloucestershire the money we be provide will enable every local authority to do that over the come decade 
 i call the shadow minister 
 at the last transport question the secretary of state suggest that driver know what they be get with a conservative government well driver know thing they be get from this government more pothole a time as many as there be crater on the moon in rac patrol attend more breakdown relate to poor road maintenance than in and aa call out be at a year high the road repair backlog have go up to an eye watering £ which be far great than his allocation of money from scrap the northern leg of hs2 be it not abundantly clear to driver and to everyone else that it will take the election of a labour government to fix britain ’s road just as it will take the election of a labour government to fix britain 
 i be delighted that the hon gentleman have ask that question because we have set out our plan very carefully there be £ of extra money to improve the quality of local road the labour party have not back that plan and have not commit a single penny of money to local road so the choice be clear if people vote conservative they get £ spend on road if they vote labour they get none

 what recent discussion he have have with transport for london on the refurbishment of gallows corner flyover 
 i be pleased to say that the gallows corner scheme be recently approve at outline business case stage with over £ worth of backing from the department for transport my official be liaise with transport for london to progress the scheme to the next stage of the process and i look forward to tfl submit the final business case for approval 
 i thank the minister for his announcement of the funding for a makeover of gallows corner flyover but i fear that we must do well this be a major junction connect the eastern side of greater london with essex and it be where the a12 and the a127 join together my constituent in romford and those of the wide essex region will be disappoint that we be not get a fundamental restructuring of the junction to address the safety and congestion issue that i have highlight for decade will he speak to transport for london go back to the drawing board and come back with something well and more permanent that will put the safety of road user 
 i will certainly go away and write to my hon friend on his specific point but i reassure he that we be spend over £ to improve that particular junction if my hon friend have concern about the scope of the work i urge he to take they up with tfl because it be for tfl to develop the full business case it be then submit to the department for approval which we hope will happen later this year 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to prevent the use of fire and rehire practice in the transport industry 
 the government recently publish a statutory code of practice on dismissal and re engagement the code will address the practice of fire and rehire aim to ensure that it be only ever use as a last resort and that employee be properly consult and treat fairly 
 the tuc have find that since about of all worker have have to reapply for their job and let we remember that in british airways try to sack staff through fire and rehire which be stop only through strike action the government take no action in go north west in manchester threaten the same and again industrial action stop it happen the government take no action in infamously p&o ferries unlawfully sack staff before replace they with agency staff the government take no action i implore the government to outlaw this practice rather than just bring in a code of good practice they should be take action to protect british worker 
 after the p&o incident in which worker be indeed treat totally unacceptably we introduce a whole range of measure set out in our point charter include the seafarers wages act which will come into force this summer we launch the seafarer charter to which p&o have now commit which i very much welcome the code of practice on dismissal and re engagement which will come in before the summer recess will give worker up to extra compensation if their employer do not abide by it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the uk minimum wage be £ an hour but last week here in parliament peter hebblethwaite the chief executive officer of p&o admit that it pay seafarer £ an hour this have be an awful breach of trust what more will the minister do to stop company act like modern day pirate of the high sea when it come to fire and rehire 
 as i mention in my previous answer many of p&o ’s practice have indeed be totally unacceptable include on minimum wage issue that be why we introduce the seafarers wages act which will ensure that seafarer operate on regular service in uk water get the minimum wage we have also co ordinated with legislation in france to ensure a minimum wage corridor for all service operate between the uk and france which will give worker the wage they deserve 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it be year since the reprehensible action of p&o and peter hebblethwaite ’s calamitous appearance in parliament come year after willie walsh and   álex cruz the then ceo of the international airlines group and ba shamefully threaten thousand of british airways worker with fire and rehire have refuse government covid assistance on tuesday i ask the minister of state at the department for business and trade   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake in this chamber to confirm whether the new fire and rehire code of practice would have prevent this threat from be make he could not do so so i ask this minister the same question and if not why not and what be the point 
 in addition to my early answer i should point out that the p&o case be be investigate by the insolvency service and i await the outcome of that investigation the point of the code of practice be to ensure that fire and rehire be very much a last resort if employer breach the code their employee can get up to great compensation the government have make sure that be the case 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last transport question my department have be get on with our plan £ for new emission bus a world lead sustainable aviation fuel mandate cut red tape for small scale fishing business take step to future proof the £ classic car industry which support ten of thousand of skilled job and ensure that taxpayer can hold local council to account for how they spend their record funding boost for road resurfacing make possible by reallocate high speed funding all labour have be able to offer be an unfunded incoherent rail nationalisation plan put the union in charge cut service for passenger and contain anti car target take we back to square 
 give that tewkesbury be of the fast grow area of the country do the secretary of state agree that we need to expand the a46 and junction of the m5 and not reduce its capacity or downgrade it in any way if any agency put plan to he to downgrade the a46 or junction will he reject those plan 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and gloucestershire neighbour for raise that issue he rightly set out that his constituency be of the fast growing he be a doughty champion for his constituent and i be sure that any agency thinking of downgrade any of his road network would not dare to do so for fear of the consequence of have to deal with he on the warpath 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 car insurance cost have increase by since the secretary of state come into office if he be intent on end the war on motorist what have he do about it

 secondly have read the letter carefully i notice that the hon lady take a pop at postcode pricing which be about pricing accord to risk it seem to i that she be propose i be sure she can not really mean this to put up insurance cost across the country to reflect the mayor of london ’s failure to grip crime in inner london 
 remember that we be now in topical question folk 
 give that the secretary of state have advance notice of my question i be afraid that his answer show how out of touch with reality he have become car insurance be not a luxury but a legal requirement and it be completely unaffordable for million of driver there have be a £ increase in the average premium in year instead of parrot conspiracy theory about minute city why do he not do his job take action demand action from regulator call in the competition and markets authority and act on soar insurance premium 
 i will say a couple of thing the hon lady call for action my hon friend the road minister have already be meet the industry and treasury ministers who be responsible for the industry regulator so we be already do that as i say this be an issue not just in the uk but elsewhere 
 secondly as i say the hon lady say in her letter that she be look at outlaw the ability for insurer to price accord to risk in local area i be sure that hon member notice that she have not deny that so they will know that she be propose for people across the country to face high cost to reflect the high crime that we see in inner london where her labour mayor have fail to get a grip

 it be obviously up to mayor to decide how to spend the money but i would expect they to spend it fairly across the entire region that they represent give that fantastic members of parliament such as my hon friend will hold they to account voter in his constituency and across the combine authority area will hopefully make the right decision when they get the chance

 urgent question to ask the deputy foreign secretary if he will make a statement on the government ’s response to atrocity risk in el fasher sudan 
 yesterday we publish a write ministerial statement outline our grave concern about report of devastating violence in and around el fasher with civilian catch in the crossfire in april the uk lead negotiation alongside mozambique sierra leone and algeria at the united nations security council to deliver a press statement that urge the war party to de escalate in el fasher and to comply with their obligation under international humanitarian law we also call for a closed un security council consultation on the situation 
 on   may the deputy foreign secretary publicly call on the rapid support forces and the sudanese armed forces to protect civilian and 
 spare sudan from their wilful destruction and carnage 
 we continue to pursue all diplomatic avenue to achieve a permanent ceasefire and we welcome plan to restart talk in jeddah we urge the region to refrain from action that prolong the conflict and to engage positively in peace talk we have use exchange with the war party to condemn strongly atrocity that they have perpetrate and to demand that their leadership make every effort to prevent further atrocity in territory that they have capture or threaten to capture as well as to press the need for improved humanitarian access 
 on   april the deputy foreign secretary announce a package of sanction designation freeze the asset of commercial entity link to the war party and we will continue to explore other lever that we have to disrupt and constrain the source of funding that both war party be use to sustain themselves we continue to support the centre for information resilience which document preserve and share evidence of reported atrocity so that their perpetrator can in due course be bring to justice there will be no impunity for human right abuser 
 finally we will keep work to ensure that the voice of sudanese civilian be hear whether they be survivor and witness of human right abuse sudanese non governmental organisation woman ’s right organisation activist help in their community or those try to develop a political vision for sudan ’s future uk technical and diplomatic support have be instrumental in the establishment of the anti war pro democracy taqaddum coalition lead by former prime minister abdalla hamdok and we will continue to support taqaddum ’s development 
 more than civilian be under immediate threat of massacre in el fasher the opposition have be call attention to the risk for several week rsf plan have be slow due to pressure from the un our diplomat and the united states but that offensive be happen now at full pelt we need the international partner with the most influence over the rsf to use their power now and stop the ongoing mass atrocity in el fasher every state must surely recognise   that the ongoing collapse of sudan into anarchy and famine be against its good interest because the general war against the people of sudan be a blight on humanity 
 the us have set out a red line promise 
 direct and immediate consequence for those responsible for an offensive on el fasher 
 how will the government back that position we need more pressure put on both the war party to move towards an immediate ceasefire and grant humanitarian access we need the government to consider all serious and rapid option for civilian protection i genuinely believe that we need to support the resistance committee and emergency room 
 the deputy foreign secretary be a good man who genuinely understand what be at stake but the opposition expect the uk ’s collective voice to be hear loud and clear at this time in the very hour when this atrocity be under way so how will the government act to protect civilian and ensure that our horror and anger be properly hear 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for her commitment to keep this appalling situation firmly on the global radar in april the uk lead negotiation at the un security council deliver a press statement that urge the war party to de escalate and to comply with their obligation under international humanitarian law as i say we have call for a consultation in private in order to be able to move this forward on   may the deputy foreign secretary call on the rsf and saf to protect civilian and to spare sudan from their wilful destruction we will continue to do all we can to bring about a sustainable end 
 we continue of course to work with a wide range of country and body include gulf and african partner the intergovernmental authority on development the african union and the un to achieve a ceasefire   and at the same time and most importantly we be increase much need humanitarian assistance and access to protect civilian we will continue to lead on the un security council where we hold the pen on sudan on   march the unsc adopt a uk draft ramadan ceasefire resolution which call for an immediate cessation of hostility 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 thank you and good morning madam deputy speaker 
 we be in a crucial moment of atrocity prevention in sudan right now the uk government must accept that what be happen be genocide the uk government have be proactive in the delivery of aid and food to the civilian of sudan but how be they react to the grow number of sudanese civilian face famine and starvation and what protection be in place to ensure that no more people be drive to catastrophic level of hunger 
 the challenge of food security be at the heart of the most urgent humanitarian work the recent integrate food security phase classification projection for sudan indicate that the intense conflict and organised violence have drive nearly people    into high level of acute food insecurity so we provide £ in humanitarian funding in the past financial year of that £ be destine for unicef for life save nutrition activity and approximately £ be for the sudan humanitarian fund for a multi sector response include a high proportion of food security intervention 
 the ongoing and develop crisis in sudan be be fuel by weapon from foreign supporter who continue to flout the un arm embargo on darfur how be the government utilise their un security council position as penholder on sudan to prevent the flow of arm to the rapid support forces 
 the hon lady ask an incredibly important question of course a long stand uk arm embargo be in place for the whole of sudan as well as a un arm embargo on darfur and we will continue as i say to use all our diplomatic tool at the un security council and with international partner to highlight that as the deputy foreign secretary have say there be now clear sign of ethnic cleansing in darfur and the continued flow of weapon allow that threat to continue for long than we want so we will continue to press in that area 
 our heart go all out to all those who be tragically be ethnically cleanse from part of sudan bear in mind our historical connection with that part of the world what direct action will his majesty ’s government take work with the united states the united nations the african union and other to ensure the safety of christians who be be murder and force out of their home surely it be time for britain to show leadership 
 the challenge that my hon friend have raise be such an important and difficult we continue to work closely with a wide range of non governmental organisation and un partner on conflict and atrocity prevention and on these really important question around loss of religious freedom we be systematically prioritise atrocity monitoring and reporting and be continue to increase our capacity when it come to human right and atrocity prevention investment we want to complete that assessment in country in order to inform how we can continue to expand the strategy and be very clear that all those who be commit these terrible crime will be hold to account 
 the scale of the humanitarian situation in el fasher be horrific and demand urgent action at the same time sudan be at the centre of a series of interlocking and interdependent humanitarian crisis that blight the whole horn of africa last week the all party parliamentary group for africa which i chair convene a high level summit to look at the issue of resilience and conflict in the horn of africa and highlight particular issue around engagement with grassroots group and increase ethnic polarisation the minister be here on behalf of the deputy foreign secretary and she be a friend of the appg on his behalf can she commit that he will meet with the appg to discuss the incredibly important action that the british government can take 
 i be sure that in the absence of the deputy foreign secretary i can afford his diary secretary the opportunity to find a slot i hope that the appg which will be do incredibly important work scan across a range of channel will have the opportunity to meet with alison blackburne who be our uk special envoy for the horn of africa sudan and the red sea we ask she to do that incredibly important work from there it have be impossible to have a special envoy within sudan but she be a great and experienced advocate and i will try to make sure that that meeting take place as soon as possible 
 i thank the minister very much for her answer will she outline what far step the government can take when the elderly the ill those who be ill equip the disabled and civilian be take to the street in an attempt to stand against the paramilitary and to protect their hospital and vulnerable people who be without aid it be not a question of if the city fall but when so how can we get medical aid and support to those hospital and vulnerable people at this very important time 
 the hon member highlight of the most difficult aspect of this issue the challenge of get relevant humanitarian access where it be need currently access into sudan remain highly constrain port sudan be the primary entry point for relief supply and onward distribution from there continue to prove challenging movement be limited but the investment have be make and of course through our relationship and all the diplomatic tool that we use we continue to work on find way to support those who be most vulnerable 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for west ham ms brown   on secure this urgent question 
 nearly humanitarian group in sudan have warn elon musk that he risk collectively punish million of sudanese by shut down his vital starlink satellite internet service in that war ravage country have the government have raise our concern about the devastation that that would cause to civilian and humanitarian aid agency 
 we will absolutely be raise the challenge of have those communication line open there be real concern and i will happily take this up with the deputy foreign secretary when he get back 
 those of we who have constituent of sudanese origin can relate to the minister the distress and concern in that community there be particular concern about the fact that i think this be now the estimate anything between and refugee be go from darfur into chad could the minister explain what support we be provide for those who be in chad because at the moment it look as though the agency that be there be unable to cope 
 the right hon gentleman raise a very important point i can update he that the deputy foreign secretary have recently be to the chad sudan border to see for himself exactly the flow that the right hon gentleman identifie he see the    sheer horror and misery”—his word not mine that these appalling act have create and he be very focused on ensure that we use our humanitarian aid to think about how we can provide support across every part of this terrible situation 
 i intend no disrespect to the minister but the government ’s response just do not seem to be as robust as it could be give the severity of the situation in sudan which be horrific she will have read report in the guardian about child alive child be pile up and shoot by rsf paramilitary in el geneina what mechanism be the government consider to prevent this genocide from spread to el fasher 
 as the hon gentleman highlight this be an appalling situation i have just highlight in relation to the deputy foreign secretary ’s visit the sheer horror and misery be work on these innocent people across the area which be absolutely beyond word as i say there be now very clear sign of ethnic cleansing and appal humanitarian abuse we be provide support for the gathering of evidence and we will continue to try to support those gather information on the ground be they ngo or civilian to make sure that those who be commit the atrocity will be hold to account 
 as i understand it previous regional effort to agree on the deployment of a peace- keeping force in sudan be rebuff last year but i find it incredibly hard to see how ever escalate atrocity and indeed catastrophe can be avoid without be that even on the agenda now because otherwise it seem to i we be talk here not so much about atrocity prevention as about atrocity monitor 
 as i say we have continue to raise this at recent meeting of the un security council and decision on how to move forward to provide protection for innocent people will be take with international partner 
 with thousand of woman be kill in this war the catastrophic humanitarian crisis particularly impact woman and the fact that woman comprise over of the internally displace people in sudan what measure be the government take to protect woman in el fasher 
 the hon lady raise a really important point about an incredibly worrying situation woman and girl be at particular risk of a significant escalation in gender base violence in july last year the uk and of other member of the international alliance on prevent sexual violence in conflict publish a statement urge all party to prevent violence particularly sexual violence and to ensure immediate humanitarian access this issue continue to be at the front of the deputy foreign secretary ’s mind and of the mind of all of our team and we have pivot our bilateral programme delivery to ensure that woman and girl be at the heart of the support we be provide

 may i join mr speaker in thank the speaker ’s chaplain the rev. canon patricia hillas for all her wise counsel and support through some difficult and celebratory moment in her time as chaplain we all wish she well on her elevation i also congratulate   the hon member for stafford theo clarke   and my hon friend   the member for canterbury rosie duffield   on their cross party parliamentary inquiry into birth trauma this week all of we who have go through childbirth can recognise their story and finding although i do have good experience with mine i fully support their call for a national birth strategy 
 i also thank all those member who take part in the debate on risk base exclusion on monday we have a good discussion the house have now take the view that a process of risk assessment for member under arrest for serious sexual and violent offence shall be put in place since monday i have be strike by how many woman in less privileged or powerful position than mine have approach i to say thank you and how that decision have change how they feel about   work here it might not always feel like it but there be a watch audience want to see we as a workplace and as employer make progress on those issue this week we do 
 last week the leader of the house and i launch a guide for mp and candidate on tackle conspiracy theory we agree that conspiracy theory be a form of radicalisation and we must all do everything we can to combat they be she therefore as disappoint as i be to see   the hon member for lewes maria caulfield   sharing in campaign literature a conspiracy theory feature in that guide relate to minute city which be closely link to antisemitism and far right movement just last week the hon lady give a staunch defence of her action show no contrition for the damage she have cause will the leader of the house send she a copy of the guide and tell she why she have make a big mistake and why she should quickly and strongly renounce it 
 do the leader of the house think it be acceptable to members that on the evening before the day of the remain stage of the criminal justice bill members do not know which or what amendment be to be debate this be an important bill with a number of significant back bench and government proposal on issue of wide public concern such as cuckooing dangerous cycling ninja sword abortion and punch manslaughter the bill come out of committee in january why have it take so long to get to report have take so long why be member leave completely in the dark about what would be discuss and when with more than page of amendment include new government change publish very late the night before that be no way to run business and it be deeply disrespectful to member it be just another symptom of the chaos at the heart of this government ’s operation and the disregard they hold for this house and that be just day of our consideration of the bill why be there such a further delay to day we should be do it next week not in another 
 extend drinking hour for the euros be welcome but that do not need to be consider on the floor of the house be that because the government have more handle concern and they be worried about defeat on the criminal justice bill or be it because even during the euros they could not organise a booze up in a brewery will the leader of the house assure the house that any further amendment or programming change for day will be publish in good time 
 the future business be yet again so light that it be almost laughable but it be actually not that funny the country face huge headwind family be in a cost of living crisis million linger on nhs waiting list and community be beset by problem yet the government of the day seem to have nothing they want to change nothing they be in a hurry to sort out and nothing to bring to this house these could we hope be the last few month that the conservatives be in power for some year do they really have nothing they want to do with it if they have nothing that they want to use their parliamentary majority for why be they even bother to hold on to it 
 i assume that the hon lady will have inform the member whom she refer to that she be go to do so 
 i do 
 excellent 
 may i send my good wish for a full and speedy recovery to prime minister fico follow the horrific attempt on his life i echo the comment from the hon lady regard the speaker ’s chaplain and wish she well on her next chapter i thank mr speaker for his statement this morning which be very helpful i also thank anthony wickins and his colleague for come to parliament this week to promote and help we all understand the importance of dementia support in this important week 
 i join the hon lady in thank not just the lead member but all member who help to bring forward the important report on birth trauma which have have a huge response across the country i know that not just the prime minister and ministers on the front bench but many organisation concern with the care of mums to be and new mum be take this report seriously i hope it will do much good on this important matter 
 the hon lady mention my hon friend   the member for lewes maria caulfield and i be sorry that she make those comment and imply that my hon friend have antisemitic view that be quite wrong and i be afraid it be a pattern of behaviour of incite unpleasant thing we have see it this week follow monday ’s vote which have lead to the statement that mr speaker have to make i be pleased that we bring that motion forward with the work that the commission do and that we now have a scheme in place i be sorry that all member do not have an opportunity to vote on that final motion and i be sorry that result of the debate be that our environment have become less safe for certain member ironically female member of parliament follow some of the action since that debate 
 the hon lady talk about the criminal justice bill she will understand that it be normal for the government to talk to people propose amendment before a bill come back but that do not mean work be not be do on the bill the bill deal with complex issue and member will of course be give a good opportunity to have oversight on any amendment or change be bring forward 
 the hon lady talk about business be light i just remind she that in this short final session of this parliament we have already introduce more bills than labour ’s last session in office by a considerable margin if business collapse it be not the fault of those on the government benches but those who be here to oppose we have even have that happen in opposition day debate it be our business and we be get it through the house if it take less time because the opposition fail to show up that be not our problem 
 today we have have the leader of the opposition set out his step but he have already be on quite a journey he get on at islington north with a flexible principle ticket he claim that he be take his party and we to dover and deal but it be become clear that due to industrial action few train under a labour government and run out of other people ’s money he will have to join a rail replacement bus service terminate at rayners lane i hope for the sake of those at dover wait on a promise of a train that will never arrive that there be a compensation scheme in place perhaps a daily allowance in the other place   i do not think that the public who have long memory will fall for the stunt go on in parallel to business question they have long memory and can look at what be happen in labour run wales they will not fall for today ’s pledge card 
 economic stability the author of the there be no money note still sit on labour ’s benches
