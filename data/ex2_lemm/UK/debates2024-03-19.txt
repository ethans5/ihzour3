what assessment he have make of the impact of raise the high income child benefit charge threshold on household income 
 these change be welcome and they mean that more lincoln family will receive more support from the government as i tell the minister in lincoln on friday will my hon friend confirm when the formal consultation on base child benefit on household income rather than on individual income will commence if the civil servant in the treasury will let he do it 
 i rise to speak to new clause to and amendment i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests in relation to bpi let i at the outset say what a particular pleasure it be to listen to the maiden speech of my new hon friend   the hon member for kingswood damien egan his description of his constituent comment to he during the by election will chime with all on the opposition side of the house it be clear that he will be an asset to the house and i think it be fair to say that south london ’s loss be undoubtedly kingswood ’s gain 
 we support accession to the cptpp because of its geopolitical benefit and the benefit to trade relatively limited thought they be set to be give that the conservative party have deliver a recession a cost of   living crisis and the bad growth rate in the g7 any uptick in trade and ultimately growth however limited would be welcome there remain however a series of concern about the government ’s approach to the cptpp and trade deal our amendment and new clause seek to address the weak arrangement for parliamentary scrutiny of trade deal the grow concern about the investor state dispute settlement and issue around performer right environmental animal welfare and food standard and the help that business will be offer to exploit the benefit however limited of this deal 
 on new clause i recognise the concern articulate by   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith which be echo by   the right hon member for north somerset sir liam fox and i be sympathetic to the former ’s call for an enhanced role for parliament i be also sympathetic to new clause from   the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green under which parliament would require an assessment of the impact of any new country ’s join the cptpp however i think we need to go far than both those new clause do labour ’s new clause would require ministers to publish such an impact assessment in parliament and to give the house a vote on any new country join the cptpp give the security issue the impact on particular sector of the economy and on job in the uk as well as the opportunity that an accession could bring the british people surely have a right to expect this house to consider the merit or lack of merit of any new accession to the cptpp 
 during the lords debate the minister say that he think that a new state join cptpp would trigger the crag process in the uk but the crag process as increase number of member across the house have largely come to agree be clearly not fit for purpose pacac be the late committee to make that clear in its recent report new clause provide the opportunity to reform part of that process let i refer to what be say by the chair of the business and trade committee my right hon friend   the member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne and by   the hon member for totnes anthony mangnall   and my hon friend   the member for walthamstow stella creasy we be promise by the secretary of state and by the minister in committee that there would be a debate under the crag process as oppose to there be just this small implement bill we now know that the debate will not happen so that be another broken promise on trade 
 the impact of new country join the cptpp will vary but could be considerable in certain situation it be only right that this country expect the house to consider those impact carefully i hope that the right hon member for chingford and woodford green and the hon member for totnes and for chesham and amersham can be persuade to support our new clause it would achieve what they want in practice and go far with the leave of the house we will press our new clause to a vote 
 on new clause i hesitate to damage the reputation of my hon friend   the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   and my right hon friend   the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell   who make excellent speech on the isds over the past year the marked acceleration in usage of the isds by large litigious corporation to challenge government climate relate or other environmental decision have prompt concern at the high level in the us in european capital and at the un so much so that government across the world be increasingly exclude or revoke the isds provision 
 the problem with the isds be that it be secretive it avoid perfectly effective domestic public legal system it discriminate against small and medium sized business it often prevent the voice of those with a genuine interest in the decision from be hear and it hold back environmental and other progressive public policy change strikingly the oecd could find no sustained evidence that the isds be key to secure and maintain business investment the nuffield trust ’s briefing for today ’s debate state that the isds could enable company to challenge some health regulation and nhs policy 
 the us canada and the european union have all take step to revoke the isds provision in some of their major treaty the average amount this be just the published case that government have be force to pay from taxpayer money be about $ for climate case it seem even more noteworthy that the un secretary general ’s special rapporteur on environment and human right express concern just last september that the isds be a significant threat to the net transition the paris agreement and tackle climate change 
 some in government clearly share some of those concern as they want to exclude the isds from the bilateral trade deal with canada and support its abolition from trade with the european union the minister be somewhat evasive in committee initially he try to duck question on why the government want to exclude the isds from a bilateral trade agreement with canada but be quite happy to leave it in the cptpp for canadian investor to use give that ministers have sign side letter with australia and new zealand to disapply the isds between our country in the cptpp it seem bizarre that they have not attempt a similar approach with canada 
 just after committee the government confirm that they be pull out of the energy charter treaty in which isds arrangement play a major role say that it do not fit with net ambition the minister might want to try again to explain why it be essential that we remain committed to the isds element of the cptpp it be time for a clear eyed assessment of the risk that the isds pose to our interest with the leave of the house the opposition will press new clause to a vote 
 there continue to be significant concern about the environmental impact of accession to the cptpp and the impact on food standard and on animal welfare the cptpp cover of the deforestation front expect to account for of deforestation by a range of environmental group be very concerned that when the uk join the cptpp preferential access to our market will be create as a result of the removal of tariff on palm oil that could increase demand for product from threatened zone and exacerbate the risk of further deforestation minister still have not publish never mind present to this house deforestation due diligence legislation under section of the environment act so it be difficult to accept minister   claim that they be fully commit to our climate change target and to protect important source of global biodiversity 
 on food standard deep concern remain that despite their protestation the deal that minister have negotiate include the cptpp will allow into the uk ever more food produce to low standard particularly animal welfare standard the whole house will remember the word of the former environment secretary   the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice who tell the house that the minister and his colleague have give away 
 far too much for far too little”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 when they negotiate the uk australia free trade agreement the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and the national farmers union in particular have raise concern that new tariff negotiate with mexico and canada will leave farmer in the uk much more vulnerable to import egg pork and chicken that be produce to standard that would be illegal in the uk the pesticide action network uk raise concern acknowledge by the trade and agriculture commission concern also raise by an hon friend behind i that more food produce use pesticide ban in the uk will be import into the uk 
 new clause would require ministers to publish a plan to help business benefit from the new trade deal it be strike that the office for budget responsibility in its recent budget analysis make it clear that trade will make a negligible contribution to growth through to under conservative party plan we remember that the secretary of state be appoint and within week export begin to fall then the minister of state be reappointe to the brief and export fall even far who could possibly have expect that to happen minister have cut funding for trade mission lead by business group themselves and cut funding for small and medium sized enterprise to get to trade show to open up new market for themselves the government website for help exporter be so poor that some firm use other country website to find where there might be opportunity minister could and should be do a whole lot well to support our business to take advantage of any benefit in trade deal 
 new clause would require ministers once the accession process be over to publish a clear implementation plan to help business benefit from cptpp preference utilisation rate for other trade deal certainly do not offer any ground for complacency give that export under the conservative party have perform bad than every other member of the g7 bar japan over the last decade it be strike that the chancellor have nothing to offer exporter and strikingly no mention of any plan to help british business exploit our come membership of cptpp in his recent budget for those reason i be sympathetic to new clause table by   the hon member for gordon richard thomson 
 on amendment as the minister know and as the hon member for chesham and amersham set out there remain serious doubt from industry about whether the change the bill allow for in relation to the uk ’s copyright framework be actually require we have have different explanation for the change from ministers   at point they be due to the cptpp on another occasion they be be make to comply with other international treaty obligation sign decade ago what be clear be that the change could have a significant impact on the ability of the music industry to support new british artist 
 because of those concern ministers be force to bring forward a consultation on the change the consultation will not finish until after the bill have complete its passage through both houses in the bad case scenario estimate by the intellectual property office the change could cost over £ it be likely that royal assent will have be grant before we know the outcome of the consultation process minister be force to bring this issue forward which i have to say be just the late example of at good a half hearted approach to the scrutiny of trade issue by those on the treasury bench 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what fiscal step he be take to support creative industry 
 at the spring budget the government announce a package of tax relief for our world lead creative industry worth £ over the next year include a relief on business rate for eligible film studio in england and enhance tax relief for visual effect 
 as we know the uk ’s cultural offer be world beat and particularly through the perform art the uk project soft power across the globe while welcome the progressive tax break for our incredible film industry it would appear that our far reach high end television offer have be leave behind in the recent budget do my right hon friend have plan to redress this deficit to ensure that the uk remain on screen around the world 
 no know more about high end tv than my hon friend whoever say that politics be showbusiness for ugly people be absolutely wrong in his case i will take away what he say and consider high end television as a potential future budget measure 
 the chancellor will be aware of the award win film the windermere children which talk about the legacy of those jewish child who survive the death camp in central europe and make a new life for themselves on the bank of lake windermere at troutbeck bridge for the last several year there have be an ongoing exhibition on their legacy at windermere library and now we look to build a last memorial alongside a rebuilt lakes school at troutbeck bridge 
 will the chancellor be interested in meet the family of the windermere child and those behind the new build and the provision of a new last memorial to their legacy at windermere at some point in the foreseeable future 
 that be a very tempting offer and i will see whether my diary permit i to visit the hon gentleman in his constituency i have not see the film but i have see a film on a holocaust theme call the zone of interest which be a remarkable british lead film that i thoroughly recommend to he 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the economy 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the economy 
 the economy be begin to turn a corner after a series of unprecedented shock inflation have more than halve gdp grow in january and the economy be on a path to long term growth 
 the economy have grow at a snail ’s pace under the tories but that snail be still fast nationally than in the north east despite our strength in clean energy manufacturing science and health on average my constituent be £ bad off that they would have be have the economy grow at the same rate that it grow under labour be it any wonder that the public accounts committee find no compelling evidence of level up be a vote for the tories not a vote for continue economic failure 
 it be not because we have grow fast than spain portugal france italy germany and multiple other country since with respect to the north east in particular the hon lady be absolutely right to say that our vision be to spread growth into every corner of the country that be why in the last month alone both the prime minister and i have be to the nissan factory in sunderland to mark its decision to make electric car model in the uk just last week we announce the opening of a massive new film studio in sunderland that will bring more than job to the north east 
 accord to the lse ’s grantham research institute the government ’s current programme for investment to mitigate the bad effect of climate change will still see climate change damage to the uk increase from of gdp to by and by the end of the century to put it into context that be the united kingdom ’s entire social care budget of around £ the climate change committee have say that the current approach to adaptation 
 fall far short of what be require 
 have the treasury make any attempt to assess the cost to gdp the public finance and job of fail to invest for climate adaptation 
 we listen very carefully to what the climate change committee say and we be absolutely committed to net in fact a conservative government pass the law require government to commit to net the hon gentleman will know that we have just become the major industrialise country to decarbonise by more than since as well as the cost we   be also mindful of the economic opportunity which be why we be invest billion of pound in our clean energy transformation 
 my right hon friend will be aware that my constituency which have cambridge to the north have fantastic new industry such as johnson matthey in royston which be at the forefront of hydrogen we have pharma company to the south and some of the good film studio in the world in hertfordshire be he consciously try to back those successful industry of the future so that our child and grandchild have fantastic opportunity for the future 
 that be absolutely what we be try to do film and tv be a good example here as it have now become an offshoot of the technology industry film such as barbie have be film in hertfordshire but have the look of the californian sunshine they can withstand the british rain because of the use of high tech device that simulate californian sunshine even in   my right hon and learn friend ’s constituency what he set out be our absolutely our plan and we will   stick with it 
 in response to covid this government introduce the furlough scheme and deliver and fund the world ’s vaccine in response to the energy price spike this government introduce comprehensive support for family the office for budget responsibility so beloved of the shadow chancellor have its long range forecast for to show gdp increase every year gdp per capita increase every year average earning increase every year in real term and productivity increase in real term so do the chancellor agree that when the shadow chancellor say that we face a moment she be right a choice between a labour party still in hock to its union boss and a conservative party commit to growth 
 i have nothing to add to my hon friend ’s brilliant list of statistic except to cite another independent organisation the international monetary fund which say that in the next year this country under conservative leadership will grow fast than france germany italy and japan 
 the british people be pay the price for year of conservative economic failure with low wage high taxis and public service on their knee time and again the conservatives hide behind international factor and take no responsibility for their failure yet figure from the oecd confirm that the uk be the only g7 advanced economy now in recession and accord to the imf our economy be forecast to have the slow growth in the g7 this year so can the chancellor tell we why be the uk so far behind other major economy under the conservatives 
 well it be not because it be actually grow fast than france germany and a bunch of other country however i be glad that the hon gentleman mention year because we can look at what have happen under year of labour in wales   where unemployment be high nhs waiting list be long school standard be bad and growth be low what be labour ’s reaction to that terrible record it have just promote the economy minister to minister 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of his tax policy on living standard 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of his tax policy on living standard 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of his tax policy on living standard 
 thank to the combined impact of national insurance cut and above inflation increase to threshold since an average worker on £ in will pay over £ less in personal taxis than they otherwise would have do these national insurance contribution cut be possible due to the significant progress we have make in combat inflation 
 i hear what the minister have to say but do he not recognise the obr ’s assessment of the interplay between the government ’s threshold change and nic the obr conclude that for every 5p gain per year there be a 10p loss particularly for those on low wage do he accept the obr assessment 
 i be sure that if the hon gentleman look carefully he will see that the government have demonstrate their commitment to support the most vulnerable in society he will also have hear my hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller   explain the circumstance as to why we have high taxis than we would desire if the hon gentleman be tell i that labour party policy be to change the threshold perhaps he can have that conversation with the shadow chancellor who can explain how she would pay for that 
 the obr have say that this will be the bad parliament on record for living standard and the only in which they have fall people be poor after year of this government we do not need fiscal tweak this economy need renewal it need to bring in investment on a major scale and a new age of education training and employment in the real economy my constituent can not afford to wait while the tory party look for its polling fortune to change have we not now reach the point where the good thing for the economy be a general election 
 i completely disagree with the hon gentleman ’s explanation not only will i repeat that our constituent completely understand the difficult global circumstance with the pandemic and the cost of living challenge follow the invasion of ukraine but i can say that we have grow fast since than many other major economy and the imf forecast that we will grow fast than germany france italy   and japan in the year to the quarter of real household disposable income per person be around £ high than the office for budget responsibility expect in its spring budget forecast we have turn a corner and the good thing to do be to stick with the conservatives 
 the minister say that the economy have turn a corner but household will be £ bad off on average under the conservatives tax plan and they will also be see their cost up by £ a week compare with before the last election be the minister proud of his record 
 we be immensely proud of our record since living standard have increase and growth be now well than that of many other major economy our absolute commitment to protect the most vulnerable in society be show recently when we provide an average of £ in cost of live support for each household we have turn a corner and the economy be improve i be just disappointed that the opposition constantly talk down the uk economy and their constituent 
 will my hon friend confirm that follow the 4p cut in national insurance that the chancellor have introduce the tax take on worker will be the low it have be for year in st austell and newquay people in a household on average income will be pay £ less this come year than they do last year 
 yes absolutely my hon friend have point out an important point on how we have have a laser focus on reduce the personal tax rate furthermore the measure announce in the autumn statement and in the spring budget will significantly add to economic activity contribute about full time equivalent job to the economy and i be sure that the whole house will welcome that 
 pensioners can often struggle because they have a fix income so i be pleased that the chancellor stick with the triple lock last year guarantee an increase of will the minister explain how the rise that people will be get in a couple of week time will make a difference to their living standard 
 my hon friend make an important point it be the case that not only have the measure in the autumn statement and the spring budget help worker but we have also focus on help pensioner those on the new state pension will benefit to the tune of about £ a year which be significant and the national insurance cut will benefit the average worker employee by £ a year therefore we have implement a fair and balanced budget and fair and balanced measure 
 family in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke have be support by this national insurance cut which mean that the average family will be £ a year well off the freezing of the fuel duty mean that motorist will be able to get around without be unfairly charge at   the pump money from this government have enable stoke on trent to cut bus fare by a so that people can travel around we have have £ from the levelling up fund and £ for the kidsgrove town deal which mean that the sport centre will be refurbish and reopen improve people ’s health chance the labour party close it because it could not be bother to pay a single pound to save it back in be it not the reality that we have a clear plan that will help the family of our great constituency particularly in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke while labour will borrow more tax we higher and lead we back into recession just as it do in 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend this be fantastic and i think it be a recur pattern mr speaker we have positivity optimism and confidence in the future of the uk economy from conservative members but absolute negativity from opposition members because they have no plan they have no clue and they have no hope we have a plan and it be work 
 i call the shadow minister 
 why do the treasury minister think people feel bad off after year of conservative government 
 as i say we be turn a corner and have therefore make measure to put money back into people ’s pocket i do not think it would come as a surprise to the hon gentleman ’s constituent or to those of any labour member look at the labour opposition ’s recent record that labour claim on the hand that it be supportive of tax cut but last week fail to support those tax cut when it come to it in parliament 
 the minister do not answer the question about why the public feel bad off we on the labour side of the house know why he mention tax cut but he do not talk about the freezing of tax threshold or indeed about the council tax that be about to be levy on people not just this year but each year for the next year why can not he admit that for every 10p extra in the pound take from people since the government be only now give back just 5p 
 if i be hear correctly the labour front benchers be announce fundamental change to policy that they have not yet cost they do not object as far as i be aware to any of the measure require to support household and business during the pandemic which necessitate increase in taxation we be now reduce the level of taxation because we have turn a corner they do not support that it be interesting that they say thing but then do not take action i think they need to explain to their constituent why they fail to support the tax cut last week 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the spring budget on level of block grant funding for scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the spring budget on level of block grant funding for scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the spring budget on level of block grant funding for scotland 
 as a result of decision at the spring budget the scottish government be receive around £ in additional funding in through the barnett formula 
 accord to the commons library the government have cut the scottish government ’s capital funding by in real term from to the institute for fiscal studies forecast that there will be a further cut by after year of austerity inflation and covid can the minister tell i why the chancellor be take a hammer to our scottish public service 
 the hon gentleman be aware that the block grant have be go up in real term he will also be aware that the scottish government can switch resource to capital unlimited amount if they choose to do so he will also be aware i be sure that the scottish government can borrow up to £ of capital each year if they so wish 
 the tories have fail to invest in our public service and high growth industry drag the nation of the uk into recession and increase income inequality the uk government continue to impose hard cut to public service the commons library have find that the scottish block grant will have fall in real term in every year since yet uk government ministers continue to deny that fact do the minister understand what real term actually mean and do she see the devastating impact that this be have on public service 
 just to be absolutely clear the scottish government ’s total departmental expenditure limit be grow in real term over this parliament by over a year on average 
 obviously the minister do not understand what real term mean after all analysis by the institution of civil engineers show a multipli effect every £ spend in the construction industry bring in an additional £ of spend that mean that the real term cut to the scottish government ’s block grant for capital by £ over year far deprive our economy of a wide £ why do this government think that it be okay to decimate infrastructure spend in scotland 
 the scottish government be well fund to deliver their devolved responsibility and receive more funding on average per person than the equivalent uk government spending in other part that translate to £ more a year on average 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 consequential have consequence the chancellor announce in his budget £ of cut for the public sector include cut of in some department and that defy logic the public sector be cry out for funding but his choice if implement will lay waste to it do the minister agree with the ifs which say that it would be genuinely surprising if the chancellor ’s plan could be carry out or with the institute for government which say that 
 these spending plan will be impossible to deliver 
 or with the resolution foundation which say that the plan be fiscal fantasy 
 over the next parliament our plan be for spending to go up in real term i want to be absolutely clear about that equally spending have go up in real term over this parliament too the hon gentleman will have notice that at the beginning of my answer i explain that scotland be get £ extra this year through barnett consequential 
 it be no wonder that the institute for fiscal studies say that there be a conspiracy of silence from both the government and the labour party over the scale of these cut as a percentage of uk spending the scottish block grant be set to fall to its low ever level under devolution dwarf its other plan for scotland house of commons library figure show capital funding fall by over the next year the chancellor have already confirm that the scottish energy sector be the big loser from his budget and he be double down why be this government and this chancellor try to be the new hammer of scots 
 the only area in which i agree with the hon gentleman be that i would love to know what the labour party ’s spending plan be for the next parliament perhaps labour members will enlighten we this evening i will repeat what i say at the beginning about capital the scottish government have unlimited ability to switch from resource spending to capital spending that be a choice that they have 
 what recent fiscal step he have take to help reduce regional economic inequality 
 what recent fiscal step he have take to help reduce the level of economic inequality between the north and south of england 
 the government continue to tackle regional economic inequality and level up the united kingdom the government be empower local leader through a range of devolution deal regenerate place across the country and invest in vital infrastructure 
 in response to this month ’s budget the director of the institute for public policy research north have say that 
 this budget be the government ’s admission that it have give up on level up this parliament despite there be much leave to do 
 deliver on the government ’s levelling up commitment would mean that my constituent would benefit from reduce social welfare dependency increase earning potential and improve health and wellbeing do the minister not think that my constituent and all citizen outside london and the south east deserve the benefit that come with economic prosperity 
 we be commit to level up and be deliver on it across the country median pay growth have be high in every region outside london and the south east under this government and the hon gentleman ’s constituency be receive £ from round of the levelling up fund and £ from round we have announce a greater manchester trailblazer devolution deal and a greater manchester investment zone which will bring more job and prosperity for all of his constituent 
 i have hear what ministers have say this morning and i must be live in an alternative universe liverpool have some of the most deprived ward in the country which have experience poverty and destitution over the past year as a result of austerity some people have access the household support fund and while we be a resilient city and will continue to support those household can the minister explain what safety net will be put in place to support those in poverty and destitution when the household support fund end in month time 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the fact that we have extend the household support fund for the most vulnerable that be on the back of £ of support during the energy crisis and nearly £ of support through the global pandemic i would just point out to the hon lady that the fundamental difference between conservative members and labour members be that we believe the good route out of poverty be through work and our party be increase employment 
 across cornwall and the isles of scilly most job be supply by very small business many of which fall below the vat threshold give the economic inequality around the region the increase of the vat threshold to £ be very welcome but the threshold be that low and the cliff edge effect of go from to have a chilling impact on grow small business and provide all year round job will the minister consider introduce some sort of taper for that £ threshold and increase the vat threshold far maybe in the region of £ 
 my hon friend be right we increase the vat threshold for small business which will benefit business across the country we feel that the £ threshold strike the right balance between manage public finance sustainably and support business but as my hon friend know we keep these thing under review 
 the port of milford haven in my constituency have be right out in front take a lead in invest in decarbonisation   and show how it can boost the economy of wales and reduce inequality yesterday it be tell that its bid to the government ’s float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme its port funding scheme have be reject out of hand will my hon friend ask his good friend the chancellor of the exchequer to meet i to talk about the important work be do at the uk ’s lead oil and gas port and about how the uk government can support those effort financially 
 flowmis be an incredibly important scheme in improve and enhance our ability to expand float offshore wind we be a huge supporter of my right hon friend ’s constituent and of the whole of wales if the chancellor can not meet he i would be very happy to do so 
 good morning just mr speaker what assessment he have make of the impact of raise the high income child benefit charge threshold on household income 
 the government will raise the point at which child benefit be fully withdraw to £ from £ and we will raise the high income child benefit charge threshold to £ from £ from   april take family out of pay the charge overall these change mean that almost half a hard work family will gain an average of £ towards the cost of raise their child 
 good afternoon mr speaker laughter these change be welcome and they mean that more lincoln family will receive more support from the government as i tell the minister in lincoln on friday will my hon friend confirm when the formal consultation on base child benefit on household income rather than on individual income will commence if the civil servant in the treasury will let he do it 
 i thank my hon friend it be a pleasure as always to meet he in his constituency on friday where we discuss this matter and many other the government will launch a consultation in due course on how to end this unfairness by administer the hicbc on a household rather than an individual basis do so would require significant reform of the tax system as our tax infrastructure do not currently have a mechanism to consider household income but the government plan to end the unfairness for single earner family in the child benefit system by administer the hicbc on a household rather than an individual basis by april 
 i thank the minister for that child benefit income be an integral part of how family make their money last through the whole week if there be any change that will reduce it in any way be it the minister ’s intention to ensure that those who have question difficulty or concern have their concern and wish take on board it be really important that those face financial change can cope with the change to come 
 i thank the hon gentleman it be precisely because of the complexity involve that we will have the consultation i be sure that his view   and those of his constituent will be warmly welcome in that 
 what fiscal step his department be take to help increase the level of business investment 
 at the autumn statement in the chancellor set out ambitious growth package design to boost business investment include make full expensing permanent and a tax cut to company of over £ a year to ensure we have of the most generous capital allowance in the world with further growth enhance measure set out in spring budget the office for budget responsibility estimate that government policy announce at the past fiscal event be expect to increase the size of the economy by by 
 like my hon friend   the member for st ives derek thomas i be delighted to see the increase in the vat threshold from £ to £ in the budget that will help small business invest for the future such as the doves café and gift shop in overton which be popular with people from both clwyd south and north shropshire however give the vital importance to small business will my hon friend prioritise increase the vat threshold again in the next fiscal intervention 
 my hon friend come to this house with significant business experience so when he talk we certainly listen and i be delighted to hear that he be pleased with the vat threshold increase i can tell he that in addition to what i say to my hon friend   the member for st ives derek thomas   about the £ threshold this level be high than that of any eu member state and be the joint high in the oecd many of his business will be among the that will benefit from the increase so we have no plan at this stage to change it 
 but the actual record of this government over the past year be abysmal it be a fact that business investment have be consistently among the low in both the oecd and the g7 and now the office for budget responsibility be forecast a further fall this year why 
 announcement in each of our last fiscal event have enhance our business investment environment for international investor we have the high foreign direct investment stock in the world we have some of the good university in the world which be attract business we have announce full expensing which be a £ a year tax cut we have the low corporation tax in the g7 and we be reform our energy grid bring investment into our net ambition we be reform our system reduce our taxis and encourage investment 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the financial conduct authority on the administration of safe hands plans 
 i recognise that this have be a very challenging time for safe hands customer the hon member will be aware that the fca as the independent regulator of the funeral plan sector be responsible for deal with specific case however the treasury and the fca have work closely throughout the process of bring the sector into regulation as well as during the implementation of the new regulatory framework 
 my experience of the fca and the safe hands funeral plan fiasco be that it take month to reply to my freedom of information request and plead commercial confidentiality to key question and that despite be warn the treasury fail to support consumer move from an unregulated sector into regulation it appear to i that the treasury miss opportunity to support consumer and be still shuffle its foot at least people be out of pocket to the tune of £ they be try to protect their love one from expensive funeral at the bad of time will the minister consider an independent review of this matter a constructive response be need to ensure that safe hands victim can have confidence in a system that for too long have let they down 
 i share the hon member ’s anger at how safe hands customer have be treat the business be under criminal investigation by the serious fraud office and its administrator be bring legal action against the former owner of the safe hands business in the treasury we do not believe it be right to use taxpayer money to compensate consumer who lose out due to the conduct of unregulated firm safe hands be not within the regulatory perimeter at that time however we have work with the sector so that the large provider of funeral plan have agree to provide significantly discount replacement plan for the customer who have find themselves so badly treat 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of increase in the cost of live on household in 
 the rise in inflation cause by putin ’s illegal war in ukraine and the subsequent energy price shock have put enormous pressure on household thank to work by the bank of england and the government the rate of inflation be go down with the office for budget responsibility expect it to be back to target next autumn 
 since the disastrous tory mini budget of household be continue to feel the squeeze at the supermarket with food price continue to rise and real wage fall for the long unbroken run   since record begin food price have rise by over the last year when will the government listen to those who wish to follow the lead of canada and france by introduce a price cap on staple food item at the supermarket 
 real wage be now happily start to rise and as i have say the obr have say that inflation will be back to target next quarter what would not help the cost of living be put people ’s taxis up as the scottish government be do 
 the tax burden be at a record high wage be stagnant rent and mortgage be up by hundred of pound and food price have go up by the resolution foundation have confirm that this be the only parliament on record during which living standard have fall our constituent deserve well when be the minister go to give the british public a chance to vote for change and call for a general election 
 we have talk a lot today about the £ of support that we put in during the pandemic and the £ of support that we put in to support people during putin ’s energy price shock the labour party do not disagree with any of those thing and i think the hon lady in her heart of heart will know that we have to pay for that at least i hope she do we have have to take some difficult decision but because of that the economy be turn a corner we be able to reduce work people ’s taxis and i hope that she and her party will find it within themselves to support we in that endeavour 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 small business drive our economy and we support they to thrive use lever across government whether that be through our small business rate relief by increase the vat registration threshold by provide relief such as the annual investment allowance or through various programme offer by the british business bank 
 the welsh government be increase the burden on small business by reduce retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief from to just despite the uk government rightly extend that relief in england in the budget that mean that business in my constituency such as the little cheesemonger now to bed presents with a difference and tu mundo be all face unsustainable business rate bill business have to find an extra £ a year for business rate alone what advice do the minister have for small business in north wales face these onerous bill 
 my hon friend be right that at the autumn statement this government extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief in england a tax cut worth £ for small business the barnett formula apply to allow the welsh labour government to offer similar relief if they want to it be disappointing if not surprising that when give the opportunity labour decide not to cut taxis for work people 
 do my hon friend agree that of the good step that the government can take to support small business in eastleigh hedge end and botley be through a package of business rate reduction will he outline to the house the progress the government have make in this regard which be desperately need 
 my hon friend be right business rate relief be a great way to support small business in eastleigh and across the country our small business rate relief mean that of all property in england already pay no business rate at all we have freeze the small business multiplier protect more than property from a multipli increase as i be just say we be support high street with our retail hospitality and leisure relief 
 just after the budget i meet some of the small business in my constituency at the flower pots in cheriton while they be pleased with some of the budget they talk about improve productivity and growth by raise the vat threshold far beyond £ and possibly to £ they feel that that would incentivise sole trader and small business to expand and work long hour they feel at present that growth be restrict because of the level of the vat threshold have the chancellor give any thought to increase the threshold to improve productivity 
 my hon friend be right to engage in the way that she be with her small business we believe that the £ threshold which have just be increase strike the right balance between manage the public finance and support small business i encourage she to look at the wide package of support that the government be provide for small business not least the business rate relief that i be just talk about 
 will the minister have discussion with his counterpart in the devolved institution to ensure that the like of sole trader and small business see a reduction in bureaucracy to make they more profitable offer more business opportunity to more people across the united kingdom 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that the government engage frequently with our counterpart in the northern ireland administration and that will continue to be the case 
 accord to the federation of small businesses in small business be suffer from late payment we be now year into a tory government why do the government not follow labour ’s lead and strengthen the law on this 
 we be acutely aware of this issue and i have have meeting with the fsb that be why the chancellor have announce plan to improve the situation for small business i be happy to outline that in writing to the hon gentleman 
 of the request from female lead business in my constituency include cùrlach and rock’n rollers be for a vat cut for hairdressing business can the minister tell i why that be not consider in the budget these business be an important part of our high street and they be often lead by woman who have miss out significantly in the chancellor ’s budget 
 we of course support hairdresser our high street and woman run business which be why we have extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief to cut taxis for hard work people be what the conservative government do 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of his income tax policy on pensioner 
 the government have nearly double the personal allowance since and in it will be more than high in real term than if it have be uprate by inflation since the personal allowance be currently set at a high enough level to ensure that pensioner whose sole income be the full rate of the new state pension or the basic rate pension do not pay any income tax 
 i have be contact by pensioner in my constituency who get a full state pension plus protect payment from the old scheme the increase in their pension in line with inflation have put they over the personal allowance threshold for pay income tax which have eat away at that increase be it the minister ’s intention in the budget to drag pensioner into pay income tax 
 as i have outline and as the resolution foundation and other have point out pensioner have gain about £ on average as a result of the government ’s decision since to increase threshold some pensioner rely solely on the state for their income and we be support pensioner through a variety of other measure not only the triple lock but pension credit and cost of living support pensioner across the country will benefit from the increase come in april 
 i welcome the recent tax cut we need to ensure that those who work hard and do the right thing be reward in their old age can the treasury please stop allocate fund to france which be clearly not stop the boat stop extortionate amount be spend on hotel for illegal migrant and reduce the foreign aid budget maybe then we can give even more to our pensioner 
 my hon friend will be well aware that government members be implement measure to tackle the very problem she outline while turn the corner in the economy and do everything we can to put more money back in people ’s pocket whether worker or pensioner 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of reintroduce tax free shopping for international visitor 
 as set out at the spring budget we be consider the finding of the office for budget responsibility ’s review of the original costing of the withdrawal of tax free shopping alongside industry representation and broad datum the government welcome further submission from stakeholder in response to the obr ’s finding as we keep all taxis under review 
 last week the obr inform the treasury committee that it have not assess the treasury ’s forecast that it would cost £ to extend tax free shopping to eu visitor the obr have also fail to support the treasury ’s assumption that eu visitor behaviour and cost can be extrapolate from assessed non eu datum the uk retail industry firmly believe that it will cost as little as £ to reintroduce tax free shopping for tourist as we mark english tourism week be it not time that we have a full independent review of the treasury ’s datum on tax free shopping 
 i thank my hon friend for her consistent championing of tourism particularly during english tourism week it be not in the obr ’s remit to consider the effect of alternative policy and as expand tax free shopping to eu visitor be not current government policy it have not consider that however the finding of the review will be useful in give insight on the overall behavioural incentive of the policy which will be relevant for both eu and non eu population it be therefore right that the government take time to consider the obr ’s finding along with other representation and within the context of broad datum as announce in the budget 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 with your permission mr speaker i would like to update the house on living standard in the uk the most recent datum suggest that despite a tough couple of year cause by the pandemic and the energy crisis living standard will return to their pre covid peak next year a full year early than originally predict by the obr they have rise by £ a household in real term since and this year ’s cut in national insurance will increase living standard by in other word to coin a phrase now be not the time to go back to square 
 give that the prime minister have be force to abandon his plan for an election on   may   and could soon be face a leadership challenge do the chancellor of the exchequer believe that his budget land well with the public or even his colleague on the government benches 
 i say very simply to the hon gentleman who use to be an hon friend that the budget will mean that the uk economy will grow fast than that of france germany italy or japan in the next year that be do the right thing for the country 
 i would like to thank the minister for the opportunity to meet uk finance yesterday which tell i and other mp that the industry plan to roll out banking hub in the next month give that my constituency have lose every single bank branch over the last few year will the minister help i to make sure that leigh on sea which have retailer will get of those banking hub 
 i thank my hon friend for her question it be important to note her consistent championing of this issue for her constituent for which she deserve huge commendation to her precise question it be important that industry not the government make decision about bank branch or banking hub but she have make her case very ably i urge she to work with cash access uk and link to ensure that she have the good chance of secure of those new banking hub as outline by the industry in her constituency 
 we come to the shadow chancellor of the exchequer 
 after the budget the chancellor write to conservative party member tell they that the government plan to abolish national insurance the economic secretary say that national insurance will vanish and the prime minister say it be his ambition to abolish it will the chancellor confirm whether he ask the office for budget responsibility to cost the government ’s unfunded plan to abolish national insurance contribution 
 i be very glad that the right hon lady ask about national insurance cut because she support they then she abstain in the lobby and now she appear to be against they like the banker bonus tax which she be strongly in favour of and then strongly against like £ of borrowing which she be strongly in favour of and then strongly against be not the actual truth that where labour should have an economic policy there be just a black hole fill with platitude 
 the chancellor do not even attempt to answer the question the chair of the obr tell the treasury committee the week after the budget 
 it be not a measure give to we to cost 
 even the chancellor ’s predecessor   the right hon member for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng who be sack for his own kamikaze budget say if you ’re go to    reduce taxis you have to show at least partially where the money ’ go to come from so i ask the chancellor where will the money come from will it come from cut to the nhs the state pension and public service will it come from increase taxis include for pensioner or will it come from increase borrowing which chancellor 
 even torsten bell from the left lean resolution foundation say that the right hon lady ’s argument that this be a mini budget style black hole be nonsense because we specifically say that we would not fund national insurance cut from increase borrowing or cut spending on public service i gently ask she if she want to put on the mantle of fiscal rectitude where be labour go to find literally billion of pound to fund unfunded spending pledge from grid decarbon isation to nhs waiting list we all know what that will lead to high taxis like under every labour government in history 
 st mary ’s in paddington be a much love much use hospital in my constituency although it be take off the list of new hospital to be redevelop i be delighted to be work with my hon friend the member for kensington felicity buchan and the minister in the lords responsible for hospital to make a case with the trust to ensure that it be redevelop could the chief secretary to the treasury please update the house on the timeframe for make available government funding so that we can submit the planning business case for the redevelopment 
 i commend my hon friend and my hon friend   the member for kensington felicity buchan   on their great work on this project there appear to be a compelling case and i know that the programme team at the department of health and social care be look closely at the proposal 
 the fife whisky festival take place in cupar early this month and be a great success the industry welcome the freeze in alcohol duty but note that it be only for month when will the government provide the long term consistency that the industry need 
 our support for the scotch whisky association be long stand and it be a pleasure to meet its representative recently we have freeze or cut duty for scottish whisky in fiscal event go back many year we be represent the scotch whisky association in trade agreement and that support will endure long into the future 
 in response to the spring budget i have hear from constituent who feel that they may have be forget under the conservatives the number of pensioner live in absolute poverty have be slash by across the country and we have protect the triple lock but could my    right hon friend please remind i of all the step that his department be take to support hartlepool ’s pensioner so that i can tell they on the doorstep this weekend 
 i would be delighted to do that the independent resolution foundation say that because of measure that this government have take pensioner be £ well off in real term than in we do thing specifically in the budget we put £ into the nhs which be use more by pensioner than anyone else and we back worker tax cut to support growth in the economy which mean that we can continue to fund the triple lock for many year to come 
 of my constituent write to i last week about her son fred he have down ’s syndrome and severe learning disability be profoundly deaf and have an autism diagnosis his parent and grandparent do the right thing and put money into a child trust fund for he fred will be next month but he lack the capacity to access his money and there be no easy way for his parent to do so will the chancellor work with colleague in the department for work and pensions and the ministry of justice to unlock the money for fred and an estimate disabled young people 
 i be happy to meet the hon member to discuss the precise circumstance of his constituent ’s case in general term it be a priority for we to ensure that people get access to that money if it be due to they 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 do the chancellor see an article yesterday in which the independent director of the institute for fiscal studies confirm that the average earner in the uk now have the low effective personal tax rate since low than in america france germany or any g7 country someone on £ the average earning for those work full time face an income tax and national insurance bill of nearly £ less than they would have do on the same real earning back in do the chancellor agree that now he have change the rule on residence and domicile the opposition ’s unfunded spending plan could lead to high taxis 
 order these be topical question and i want to get to the member who have not yet be call 
 i thank my hon friend for her excellent question she be right that it be not just the low effective tax rate for someone on average earning since but the low headline tax rate and the low tax rate in the g7 that be the fundamental divide in british politic taxis have go up and on the government benches we do not think that we have to accept the status quo on the opposition benches they do why be that because low taxis mean high growth 
 a recent survey from the debt justice campaign have show that of adult have miss or more bill or credit payment in the past month and people be now in financial difficulty do the chancellor   accept that for million of people get from end of the month to the next under the tories be a nightmarish struggle and that people feel bad off because they be bad off 
 may i gently correct the hon lady as i say living standard have rise by £ per household since and the number of people in absolute poverty be down by she be right to talk about the debt pressure that people face which be why in the budget we abolish the £ fee for debt relief order have talk to citizens advice 
 the propose change to wine duty will add huge cost and complexity to business far to my westminster hall debate will my hon friend meet i and representative of wine business to hear their concern and make permanent the easement that be due to end on   february   next year 
 my hon friend be talk about the large and most significant reform of our alcohol duty system in year we be make it more simple by say the strong the alcohol by volume the more duty pay we introduce the wine easement to give the wine industry year to prepare for the change i continue to engage with the industry and i will continue to engage with he 
 year ago p&o ferries sack worker and replace they with agency staff pay less than the minimum wage after that fiasco the government promise to review all contract with the company why be it that since then the government have spend £ directly with p&o ferry why be the conservatives so comfortable spending taxpayer money on reward the appalling treatment of work people 
 let i say to the hon lady who i very much enjoy work with on the select committee that our record be more people in work for every single day of conservative government since what will wreck that be labour ’s new deal for worker which the president of the cbi say will destroy the job create machine that the uk have become 
 i commend the treasury for good fiscal policy that have result in inflation fall significantly since the pandemic when might we see a commensurate fall in interest rate 
 i be very sorry to disappoint my hon friend but chancellor never comment on decision make by the bank of england on interest rate what i can say be that the office for budget responsibility predict at the budget that inflation would fall to around target in the next few month that give the good possible prospect of interest rate start to fall 
 last night on bbc ’s newsnight it be clear that the need of wales in particular on health be not meet in the uk when have the uk government ever give england barnett consequential base on need in wales scotland or northern ireland surely the model of spending under which the government in england decide for england and everyone else get a consequential of    that must end nordic country do not calculate spend as a percentage of their neighbour spend why be the spending of scotland wales and northern ireland dependent on what england decide to spend 
 the barnett consequential formula be long establish it give a clear framework through which we can understand spending in the devolved nation the hon gentleman will know that it mean high per person funding in each of the devolved nation than in england 
 i be delighted that my right hon friend the chancellor be seek to make the tax system more family friendly include by collect household datum in the year ahead but be family friendly include look after the family home sweden abolish inheritance tax in the result be a boom in entrepreneurship economic growth and high tax revenue will he or of the excellent ministerial team meet i to discuss that far 
 i thank my right hon friend for his advocacy in support of family we have have conversation and i know that he very much welcome the change to the high income child benefit charge and child benefit we always keep taxis under review and i be always delighted to meet he 
 do the chancellor accept that he have cause a great deal of anxiety and further distrust among those who have be infect and affect by the contaminate    blood scandal by not make any provision in his budget for compensation although the recommendation for compensation be make to the government last april 
 i gently say to the right hon lady that i stand by every word i say when i give evidence twice to the infected blood inquiry the government have an absolute moral responsibility not just to pay the compensation owe but to pay it as speedily as possible 
 i would like to join the economic secretary to the treasury and my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   in discuss the closure of bank barclays bank in particular be both shameful and shameless in this regard do my hon friend agree that we need full transparency on the decision make by link and the financial conduct authority something we learn yesterday that may be of interest to those in chorley mr speaker be that the criterion take into consideration only the town plus area within a km circumference that be not how the rural economy work will the economic secretary work with i to ensure that the criterion take into account the wide economy 
 my right hon friend be another good example of a member who be an excellent champion for her constituent on this issue and so many other as for her specific point it be right for the industry to work out how it will increase provision and adapt the criterion for rural area but i will work with she to ensure that the banking hub be roll out in an equitable way to rural as well as more urban area 
 urgent question   to ask the secretary of state if he will make a statement on the situation in gaza and israel 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question 
 israel suffer the bad terrorist attack in its history on   october   last year the scene that we see on that day be appalling and hamas ’s disregard for civilian welfare continue today more than month later we remember all the time those who be still be hold hostage and their family and we call once again for their immediate release however we naturally remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in gaza and the impact of the conflict on all palestinian civilian we have bear witness to death and displacement on a vast scale more than people have have to leave their home many on multiple occasion we be deeply concerned about the grow risk of famine exacerbate by the spread of disease and of course about the terrible psychosocial impact of the conflict which will be feel for year to come 
 we be totally committed to get humanitarian aid to all those people in gaza who desperately need it do so either ourselves or through un agency and british or other charity we and our partner be push to get aid in through all feasible mean by land sea and air we have treble our aid funding to the occupied palestinian territories this year provide just under £ of which £ have be deliver as humanitarian assistance on   march   a further tonne of uk aid arrive in gaza include family tent blanket nearly shelter kit and shelter fixing kit sleep mat and more than dignity kit a field hospital provide through uk aid funding to uk med arrive in gaza from manchester last friday this facility staff by uk and local medic will be able to treat more than patient a day along with cyprus the united states the united arab emirates and other britain will help to deliver humanitarian aid by sea to a new temporary us military pier in gaza via a maritime corridor from cyprus 
 we have make it clear however that air and sea delivery can not be a substitute for the delivery of aid through land route only through those route can the demand for the volume of aid that be now require be meet we continue to press israel to open more land crossing for long and with few screening requirement there be no doubt that land crossing be the most effective mean of get aid into gaza and israel must do more there be also no doubt that the good way to bring an end to the suffering be to agree an immediate humanitarian pause and progress towards a sustainable permanent ceasefire without a return to destruction fighting and loss of life reach that outcome be the focus of all our diplomatic effort right now and a goal that be share by our international partner we urge all side to seize the opportunity and continue negotiation to reach an agreement as soon as possible 
 yesterday a un back report reveal the shocking reality that famine in gaza be imminent half the population be expect to face catastrophic level of hunger the high number of people ever record as be in that category under this system only twice in year have famine condition be reach but what distinguish the horror in gaza from what have come before be that it be not drive by drought or natural disaster it be man make it be the consequence of war it be the consequence of aid that be available not reach those who need it food be pile up in truck just a few kilometre away while child in gaza be starve it be unbearable and it must not go on 
 international law be clear israel have an obligation to ensure the provision of aid the bind measure order by the international court of justice require it the world have demand it for month yet still aid flow be woefully inadequate aid actually fall by half between january and february that be outrageous the continue restriction on aid flow be completely unacceptable and must stop now just as hamas must release the hostage now i do not doubt that the minister agree with i but will he have the courage to say that the icj ’s order include on aid be bind and that israel must comply with they do the lawyer at the foreign commonwealth and development office believe that israel be currently in compliance with its obligation 
 amid this accelerate hunger crisis prime minister netanyahu reportedly approve plan for an offensive against rafah that would risk catastrophic humanitarian consequence it would be a disaster for civilian and a strategic mistake how be the government work to prevent a further attack on rafah the truth be this it will not be possible to address the crisis in gaza if the fighting do not stop and that be also the good way to secure the release of hostage will the government finally join we and dozen of country and call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question and comment which i will try to deal with more or less sequentially he ask i about the report of famine the integrated food security phase classification or ipc report be clear it say that famine be a very real scenario we be do everything we can to try to head that off as i set out in my response to the urgent question in addition to famine there be also   the danger of disease the lack of health service and the acute danger from the lack of clean water and effective sanitation we be do everything we can to head off the appalling circumstance that the right hon gentleman set out 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the number of truck i can tell he that on sunday truck do get in but that be woefully short of what be require it be more than have be get in in march which have average each day so far and in february that figure be only although he will be well aware that before the crisis more than truck a day be get in 
 the right hon gentleman also ask about the icj as everyone in the house will know the icj judgment be bind in respect of the offensive against rafah the foreign secretary and the prime minister and indeed   all our ally have consistently warn that an offensive against rafah at this time would have the most appalling humanitarian consequence 
 may i finish by take the point that the right hon gentleman again make about a ceasefire as far as i be aware the position of the labour front bench be still the same as the position of the government we be call for an immediate pause so that we can get the hostage out and aid in follow we hope by a sustainable ceasefire that be what we be work towards 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 may i start by put on the record my gratitude to the minister for the middle east who make significant representation ahead of ramadan to reduce tension in jerusalem and allow access to the al aqsa mosque which so far remain calm the ipc report make for breathtakingly difficult reading and the humanitarian situation be catastrophic but it need not be may i ask that we please push hard on truck entry from jordan and ensure that it be fully operationalise and can my right hon friend tell i when the house will be formally update on whether israel be demonstrate commitment to international humanitarian law 
 i thank my hon friend for her comment about my colleague lord ahmad the minister for the middle east which i will pass on to he in respect of international humanitarian law we be go through the necessary legal process which be complex but i can tell she that as soon as we be in a position to update the house on what we have set out clearly before we will do so 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i take absolutely no satisfaction in say that a month ago in this chamber i say that innocent people will die because of israel ’s decision to prevent food from get to those who need it the report of an imminent famine should surprise no we have all know that this deliberate man make famine be come the foreign affairs committee have just return from al arish on the egypt gaza border where we see hundred and hundred of lorryload of food and aid wait for permission to get into gaza 
 let we be very clear about our language here the people of gaza be not starve they be be starve do the minister accept that there be no food shortage in the region do he accept that people be starve to death just mile from tel aviv the distance between glasgow and edinburgh as a direct result of the israeli siege and the premeditated decision to cut off food supply do he also accept that starve a civilian population to death be a war crime finally do he still believe that the uk be right both legally and morally to continue sell weapon to israel 
 on the hon gentleman ’s final point he be well aware of the arm sale regime that britain adopt as i have say to he before from the dispatch box it be the tough regime anywhere in the world   interruption if i may say so the difference between he and i be that he see thing as we would wish they to be but we in the government have to deal with they as they be that be why we be take so many step to try to achieve the release of the hostage and to get aid and support into gaza 
 of the point the hon gentleman make be right and it be echo by the shadow foreign secretary the way to get aid into gaza be by road and by truck of course we be do everything we can to explore every way include the maritime route and drop aid from the air but at the end of the day aid be deliver by road that be reason why we be work so closely with jordan to ensure that the aid route into gaza by road be enhance at the end of the day that be the right route to get aid in and we be do everything we can to try to make sure that it be pursue 
 last time i ask my right hon friend about progress on try to have a hostage transfer because right at the core of this conflict be the visceral feeling of the israelis that they want their people home which anyone can understand have any progress be make and would he like to update the house on where we be with that 
 i completely agree with my right hon and learn friend which be why try to get the hostage home and out of gaza and try to get food in be absolutely our twin objective in an extremely difficult circumstance britain be certainly right at the front of all country in try to achieve that it would not be sensible for i to give the house a run commentary on hostage release but he will have see that negotiation have resume in qatar obviously everyone in the house will hope that those negotiation be both speedy and successful 
 a new independent multi agency investigation by the united nations into an israeli military airstrike on a residential compound housing an emergency medical team include from medical aid for palestinians a uk charity have find that it most likely involve a lb us manufacture bomb fire from an f-16 jet those f-16 include part supply by the uk can the minister today set out conclusively that no part supply by the uk be use to bomb a compound housing medical staff from a uk charity will he rule that out 
 the event that the hon gentleman describe be appalling and what the british government would say be that there must be a full and transparent inquiry and examination into how those event take place 
 it remain incredible that some people in this place can barely utter a word of criticism of the hamas regime in gaza who themselves be be accuse of steal and hoarding aid with regard to the operation in rafah the israeli government have be very clear that hostage be be hold there and that some of they have be subject to sexual violence and other abuse be we say to the israeli government that they have no right to go in and seek to rescue those hostage 
 no as my hon friend know we have be absolutely clear throughout that israel have the right to self defence and what he be describe be cover by the right to self defence he set out eloquently that absolute blame for what have happen lie with hamas for perpetrate the event of   october and once again he be absolutely right to set out that context 
 we be talk as if famine be imminent but the fact be that the un report that palestinian child have already die from starvation and hunger josep borrell have say that hunger should not be use as a weapon of war and i hope that the minister would agree we need that ceasefire immediately we need it to get the hostage out we need it to get aid in and we need it to get all the killing to stop my question to the minister be simple what we be do be not work but there be more thing we can do which be to change how we vote at the security council will the uk stop abstain and join the rest of the world in call for that immediate ceasefire now 
 the hon lady speak on these matter with great knowledge and great sincerity and i greatly respect what she say the problem with call for an immediate ceasefire be that it may salve our conscience but it be not deliverable because neither side in this appalling brutality be willing to embrace a ceasefire that be why the policy of the british government be to argue in every way we can for a pause so that we can get the hostage out and get aid in which can then lead to a sustainable ceasefire that be what we will continue to do in all international fora include the united nations 
 over the past few month we have all listen to the minister explain that the government have be beg plead with and press the israeli government to allow more aid in but seemingly to little effect have he now reach the conclusion that the israeli government be wilfully obstruct the entrance of aid into the gaza strip if so that would presumably be a breach of the international court of justice ’s ruling and indeed of international humanitarian law what would be the consequence of that conclusion 
 i do not agree with my right hon friend ’s premise because i do not think we be in the position to reach that judgment but the point he be make be that it be essential to get more food aid support and medicine into gaza and every day the british government be work intently to that end 
 mr speaker 
 famine be a reality the high hunger level of anywhere else in the world in term of total number all manmade a ceasefire be an absolute requirement 
 those be the word of matthew hollingsworth the country director of the world food programme and of the un secretary general starvation be indeed be use as a weapon of war in gaza it be clear that israel be engineer a famine for more than civilian it be also clear that uk diplomacy have fail so the minister must now indicate what action the government will take to escalate pressure to stop israel ’s military   assault to demand a ceasefire and to ensure that emergency assistance be provide through unwra to those be starve to death 
 i think that many people in israel and elsewhere will find part of what the hon lady have say profoundly offensive she be right to say that the characteristic of famine be present in gaza as i set out in my early response and that be why we be do everything we can together with our ally to get as much food and support into gaza as possible 
 official on the ground have state that hamas be appropriate or misappropriating as much as of the humanit arian aid enter the gaza strip this be part of a long pattern of prioritise fighter abuse aid to produce rocket and use construction material to build hundred of mile of tunnel for their terror activity we know that they do it they have do it for year and they be do it now do my right hon friend share my concern that hamas be flagrantly disregard the humanitarian need of the people of gaza while israel have be increase the amount of aid go in exponentially 
 i very much agree with my right hon and learn friend that hamas be use ordinary people in gaza as a human shield it be utterly repugnant as well as completely against international humanitarian law and like he i condemn it 
 humanitarian organisation have be warn repeatedly that this would happen a group of we meet they last week and when this conflict start i meet islamic relief which be base in my constituency we now end up here where we be see healthcare be attack and systematically degrade we be see no safe zone leave we be tell of the onset of famine and that the number of people be kill keep rise will the minister finally please listen to the call of member across this house of the international community and of the people work on the ground and call for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted aid 
 i have set out several time already today why call for an immediate ceasefire may make we feel well but be not a practical resolution that be why—[interruption there be no difference between the analysis that the hon lady make and the ngos in her constituency and my analysis the question be what do we do about it that be why britain along with our ally be continuously on a basis do everything practical that we can to get more food and support into gaza 
 my right hon friend have mention the float pier to be construct by the united states what assurance have he receive that the pier will be use solely for the delivery of humanitarian aid and not as have be suggest subsequently repurpose for military use 
 it be early day yet to see precisely how that maritime initiative will deliver but i do not believe that what my right hon friend fear will be allow to   happen as we tackle that issue we be give strong support to all mechanism for get aid into gaza air sea and land but he like i will understand that the good mechanism be always by land 
 i do not think i have ever receive as many email of concern from constituent as i have about the situation in gaza as have already be say over palestinians be at starvation level and child and adult have die so far as a result of starvation and dehydration in the word of medical aid for palestinians 
 this be not happen because the rain have fail or there have be a poor harvest it be because the israeli authority refuse to allow enough food into gaza 
 so i have this question for the minister and my edinburgh south west constituent will be listen to the answer do he agree that starvation as a weapon of war be a war crime 
 the point that i hope the hon and learn lady will make to her edinburgh constituent be that she and i the government and the whole house be intent on ensure that more food and more support get into gaza as rapidly as possible that be what the government be do every day 
 i welcome the hard work that the minister be do to get more aid in to bring an end to the fighting and to get the hostage release but it be appal to think that large number of innocent people include child be about to starve when there be aid just over the border he be right that aid must flow across the border and that it be well to transport it in truck but if that be not possible we must think of this like the berlin airlift we have to get aid in by sea and by airdrop i welcome what the americans be do to drop aid on the shore and we have to do whatever it take to get the aid to the kid who be go to starve unless we get it to they 
 i completely agree with the sentiment that my hon friend express so profoundly he be right that every single mechanism must be explore but he will know that the amount of aid we can drop from the air the danger to those underneath and the danger of the aid be misappropriate and steal by hamas be very real difficulty he will also be fully aware of the difficulty of maritime entry that be why we be do everything we can to argue for more point of entry into gaza more truck and more land route to get the aid in that be desperately need 
 the icj ’s interim ruling make it clear that the killing of palestinians in gaza must stop but it have not that immediate humanitarian aid must be allow into gaza but it be not and that the safety and security of civilian must be guarantee but it be not as a result more than palestinians in gaza be leave starve and on the brink of famine as confirm by today ’s ipc report 
 the israeli government continue to flout international law by use starvation as a weapon of war child be starve civilian be be kill and medical facility be be attack what will it take for this government to stand with international humanitarian law and oppose   the action of the israeli military how many more innocent palestinians must be massacre how many more child must die through starvation when will the government call for an immediate ceasefire 
 the thing that be miss from the hon gentleman ’s list be an urgent call for the release of the hostage 
 in answer to the hon gentleman ’s question israel must do more we set out very clearly the step it need to take an immediate humanitarian pause increase capacity for aid distribution inside gaza increase humanitarian access through land and maritime route expand type of humanitarian assistance allow into gaza such as shelter and item critical for infrastructure repair and the resumption of electricity water and telecommunication service i hope that we can unite with everyone else in this house on go after those key aim 
 the israeli hostage must be release and innocent palestinians in gaza must be support the foreign affairs committee meet egyptian president el sisi when we be in the gaza border region a fortnight ago what particular support can this country provide to the egyptians on deliver aid and avert a potential humanitarian and refugee crisis if the situation be not stabilise 
 i thank my hon friend and all the select committee member for their work their visit and the powerful argument they have add to those of the government 
 in response to my hon friend ’s direct question i meet the head of the egyptian red crescent in egypt we be in very close contact to make sure that british aid and british support enhance the excellent effort that the red crescent be do everything it possibly can to prosecute 
 it be clear that prime minister netanyahu have not take the slight notice of anything the british government or even the americans have be say mrs thatcher suspend arm sale to israel in and tony blair do the same in what on earth would it take for this government to follow their example 
 the right hon gentleman refer to the view of prime minister netanyahu and he will know that both our prime minister and the foreign secretary have engage directly with prime minister netanyahu to ensure that he be fully aware of what britian think 
 the right hon gentleman will also be aware that israel be a pluralist democracy the only in the region he will be aware that israeli minister benny gantz whom the foreign secretary recently meet in london have different view from prime minister netanyahu there be many different view and britain strongly support the view that i have set out to the house today 
 it be not for minister to make policy on arm sale and the arm regime from the dispatch box it be for the proper due process as lay down and approve by parliament and as lay down in law and that be what we follow 
 give the impending famine in gaza as outline by the ipc report will the uk align with the eu sweden australia canada and many other country by restore funding to unrwa as the most effective way to urgently and immediately scale up the delivery of aid food and medical supply to gaza 
 as my hon friend know we expect the report from the united nations office of internal oversight services and indeed the interim report from catherine colonna the former foreign minister of france tomorrow and we will read it with very great interest catherine colonna be work with the raoul wallenberg institute in sweden the chr michelsen institute in norway and the danish institute for human rights and we hope that her report will show a road map by which funding to unrwa from britain and many other country can be restore 
 my hon friend will equally be aware that unrwa be fully fund for some month hence and that british funding be fully pay up until into the next financial year
