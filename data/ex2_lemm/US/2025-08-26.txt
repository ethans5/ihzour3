                                 of texas 

                     in the house of representative 

                         tuesday august 

   mr. pfluger mr. speaker i rise today to include in the record an 
 opinion column from the odessa american title ` ` campbell the nature 
 of truth,&#x27;&#x27 publish may in it the author reflect on how 
 society grapple with compete claim of truth and encourage reader 
 to return to foundational and verifiable source a theme with deep 
 implication for both our civic culture and the way we approach 
 legislation 
   i believe this thoughtful reflection be a meaningful reminder of the 
 importance of clarity honesty and share understanding in democratic 
 discourse 

                        from the odessa american 

                      campbell the nature of truth 

        truth be ephemeral in the temporal world it seem that 
      everyone have his or her own version and whether or not they 
      actually know the truth be open to interpretation and subject 
      to one&#x27;s own preference or prejudice it&#x27;s a key concept in 
      my business journalism where truth be the lynchpin we be 
      bind to be truthful to the good of our ability and we be 
      prohibit from write anything that we know to be false we 
      can be fire for do it 
        that&#x27;s the difference between the odessa american and 
      publication like the national enquirer which publish 
      nothing but story that they know to be untrue that&#x27;s not 
      to say we never publish falsehood but we don&#x27;t do it 
      deliberately it&#x27;s that we have good reason like credible 
      source and reliable reference to believe that what we write 
      be true 
        in the case of political candidate if we have to believe 
      everything they say we would never write anything about they 
      we&#x27;re not say that what they say be true we&#x27;re say 
      it&#x27;s true that that be what they say we attribute 
      accurately and leave it to the reader to ascribe credibility 
      or not 

 page e787 

        there have never be a newspaper or a book write that have 
      nothing false in it only book be percent true the 
      bible god can not lie and we may be certain that every word 
      of the bible be true 
        depend on the translation jesus time in the 
      gospels use the phrase ` ` i tell you the truth&#x27;&#x27 or 
      variation of it and in john 14:5 he be even more specific 
      when he say ` ` i be the way the truth and the life.&#x27;&#x27 so he 
      be not just tell the truth he be and be the truth he 
      embody it i think jesus emphasize the truth and the fact 
      that he be always tell it because he understand the 
      inherent deceitfulness of the world he be say if you 
      want the pure truth look to i 
        at the end of revelation we see the importance of this 
      issue when it say that everyone who love and practice 
      falsehood be classify with the sexually immoral murderer 
      and idolator as be among those who will be damn of 
      course some people occasionally tell white lie in deference 
      to the feeling of those they love but then people who be 
      always strictly truthful be often respect for it and their 
      candor be accept in deference to the value they espouse 
        truth derive from wisdom and like wisdom it be more 
      valuable than much pure gold and sweet than honey from the 
      honeycomb the english philosopher francis bacon 
      say truth be the child of time mean that it emerge and 
      be reveal through the passage of time not through 
      someone&#x27;s immediate authority or declaration 
        when we hear thing privately or in the public arena if 
      the truth of they be not discernible we may be confident that 
      time will show the truth the political writers&#x27 adage be 
      that nothing anyone say during a campaign may be true but 
      during the course of it the truth will become clear and the 
      voter will know whom to vote for from the total body of the 
      dialogue german philosopher immanuel kant say 
      lie steal one&#x27;s dignity and we know from scripture that 
      god want we to maintain our dignity as christians by 
      avoid such thing 
        stone campbell church movement leader alexander campbell 
      advocate for a rational and deliberative 
      understanding of christianity firmly rooted in the new 
      testament he oppose both speculative theology and emotional 
      revivalism emphasize a return to the bible as the primary 
      source of truth campbell advocate for a focus on biblical 
      text and avoid theological system that rely on 
      philosophical or speculative reasoning 
        truth derive from the wisdom develop through the fear of 
      the lord and wisdom and truth be indispensable in our 
      pursuit of virtue how may we obtain these treasure of the 
      holy spirit of course through prayer read scripture 
      attend church and fellowshippe with other christians 
        pray and ask god for the wisdom to discern truth and 
      succeed in our ever advance pursuit of high and high 
      virtue ask to be empower to bear well the responsibility 
      of be a link in the multi generational sustenance and 
      progress of good character in your family ask for a complete 
      god give understanding of the nature and importance of truth 
      and thereby avoid the error that can set back or thwart your 
      spiritual goal
