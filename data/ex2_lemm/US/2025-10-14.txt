                        tuesday october 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the government 
 accountability office district of columbia home rule act this bill 
 would repeal the authority of the u.s. government accountability office 
 gao over the district of columbia 
   gao a federal agency that conduct investigation and audits for 
 congress have the same authority over d.c. that it have over federal 
 agency gao&#x27;s authorize statute define d.c. as a federal agency 
 in addition gao&#x27;s authorize statute and the d.c. home rule act 
 require gao to engage in specific type of oversight of d.c. 
   d.c. be not a federal agency and it should never be treat as such 
 d.c. already have a locally appoint auditor and inspector general so 
 gao&#x27;s authority over d.c. be both redundant and offensive gao do not 
 have general authority over state and city and therefore it should 
 not have such authority over d.c. 
   this bill be an important step to increase home rule for d.c. i urge 
 my colleague to support this bill
