 internalized shame among people with disability and to promote the 
 belief in society that disability be a natural and beautiful part of 
 human diversity in which people live with disability can take 
 pride 
   in the americans with disabilities act be sign into law 
 this bipartisan effort make a commitment that our history of 
 segregate and isolate person with disability would end in the 
 law&#x27;s own word the purpose of the ada be to ` ` provide a clear and 
 comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination 
 against individual with disabilities.&#x27;&#x27 
   by set enforceable standard provide assistance for 
 compliance and assert the federal government&#x27;s central role in 
 end discrimination this landmark civil right law have provide hope

 individual with disability have the legal right to fully participate 
 in our society the right to transportation health service shopping 
 entertainment education employment public accommodation and 
 voting 
   those who fight so hard to win its passage include my friend and 
 mentor marca bristo the founder and head of access living deserve to 
 celebrate its enactment and deserve our thank but as we celebrate 
 today we have to get to work tomorrow we need to build on the ada&#x27;s 
 promise whether it be pass my bill the eleanor smith inclusive 
 home design act to make sure that all new residential housing build 
 with federal dollar be accessible or increase the employment of 
 adult with disability 
   this year we have see a number of legislative attempt to take away 
 right from disabled individual the big ugly bill which republicans 
 pass through congress be go to strip health care away from nearly 
 individual include many with disability i stand on 
 the frontline with disability advocate who have truly be the tip of 
 the spear in the fight to protect all americans&#x27 health care while we 
 do not win this battle the fight be not over the power of the people 
 be always great than that of the people in power 
   as long as discrimination still exist and as long as there be those 
 who seek to undermine exist law the purpose of the ada will not 
 have be completely meet it be our job to make sure that happen
