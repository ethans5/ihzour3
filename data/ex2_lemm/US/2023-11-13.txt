                        monday november 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 national guard federal employee leave fairness act which would 
 prohibit the department of defense dod from recoup pay from 
 district of columbia national guard dcng member who 

 page e1094 

 be federal civilian employee or district of columbia employee and 
 take encampment leave the dod claim these employee be not entitle 
 to encampment leave without a loss of pay while i disagree with the 
 dod&#x27;s interpretation i be introduce this bill to resolve this 
 matter 
   congress partially address this matter in the national defense 
 authorization act for fiscal year ndaa by adopt my amendment 
 that effectively prohibit the dod from recoup pay for encampment 
 leave take by dcng member after the enactment of the ndaa that 
 amendment however do not apply to encampment leave take before the 
 enactment of the ndaa because of budget rule 
   in congress codify in the d.c. code the original authority 
 for entitlement to leave when federal civilian employee be mobilize 
 by the dcng in that authority be move into u.s.c. sec 
 in that same year congress authorize additional leave 
 entitlement in u.s.c. sec as well as establish a salary 
 offset provision in u.s.c. sec reference those additional 
 leave entitlement however because the u.s. code have not be update 
 to include the early dcng authority the u.s. code contain a 
 duplicate subsection refer to dcng mobilization and to a 
 general leave entitlement for the national guard and reserves 
   base on this legislative drafting error the dod have sometimes 
 attempt to apply a salary offset to dcng member who be federal 
 employee and take encampment leave and the dod have indicate it will 
 do so again soon the government accountability office gao have say 
 that u.s.c. sec 6323(c be not intend to be subject to a salary 
 offset under u.s.c. sec and note in that the ` ` office of 
 personnel management advise that it now believe that the salary 
 offset provision of u.s.c. sec do not apply to d.c. national 
 guardsmen under the circumstance describe in u.s.c. sec 6323(c).&#x27;&#x27 
 however the office of personnel management once again believe that 
 the salary offset provision of u.s.c. sec apply to u.s.c. 
 sec 6323(c 
   dcng member sincerely believe that they be take this leave 
 correctly they have rely on this money the recoupment will cause 
 financial hardship for current and former dcng member and it be 
 congress&#x27 intent that dcng member be entitle to this leave without 
 a salary offset 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
