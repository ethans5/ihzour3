                         thursday june 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the real id gender 
 requirement reform act which would remove the requirement from the 
 real id act that real id compliant license include gender instead 
 the decision of whether to have gender on a state&#x27;s real id compliant 
 license would be leave to the state i be pleased representative 
 maxwell frost be co lead this bill 
   this bill would require state that require gender designation for 
 license to allow individual wish to change their gender 
 designation on their license to do so through self attestation it 
 would also require state that require gender designation on license 
 to have a neutral or other designation gender field in addition to 
 male or female 
   under the real id act gender must be include on a license this can 
 be problematic for transgender or nonbinary individual i recognize 
 that some lgbtq+ individual do not want gender designation on 
 license at all while other do want gender designation so as to 
 express their identity i believe this bill strike the middle ground 
 while show congress&#x27 support for lgbtq+ individual 
   this be an important bill for equality i urge my colleague to 
 support this bill
