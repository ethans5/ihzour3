                           friday july 

   ms. jackson lee mr. speaker each july we have an opportunity to 
 pause and reflect upon our past and celebrate our future for what we as 
 a nation have accomplish 
   today we can celebrate that over the nearly and a half century 
 we have conquer the crucible face from the civil war global 
 conflict and global deadly pandemic and an assault on our capitol-- 
 the citadel of democracy the birthplace of all modern democracy 
   the success of our democracy and the mean provide to the people of 
 this nation to shape its present and guide it into the future have be 
 and continue to be the ballot box 
   martin luther king&#x27;s speech at the march on washington explain the 
 power of the vote to empower we the people to shape our destiny 

        ` ` give we the ballot and we will no long have to worry 
      the federal government about our basic right ` ` give we 
      the ballot and we will no long plead to the federal 
      government for passage of an anti lynching law ` ` give we 
      the ballot and we will fill our legislative hall with man of 
      good will ` ` give we the ballot and we will place judge 
      on the bench of the south who will do justly and love mercy 
      ` ` give we the ballot and we will quietly and non- 
      violently without rancor or bitterness implement the 
      supreme court&#x27;s decision of may in brown v. the 
      board of education 

   we be not govern by the rule of might make right which be what 
 almost happen when january insurrectionist attempt to overthrow 
 our governmental process for elect our nation&#x27;s president 
   we be nation of law make by americans on the behalf of americans 
   which be why it also important to affirm and understand our history 
 as americans 
   the united states come into be under impossible odd a vast land 
 mass housing separate colony of disparate people with parochial 
 interest up against the world&#x27;s sole superpower of their time 
   after the revolution and a government be organize king george be 
 not alone in predict its demise because it be a collection of 
 colony try to rule itself as a nation 
   the schism appear as the industrial revolution take hold and 
 woman begin to push against the bond that limit they in social 
 economic and political expression 
   frederick douglass a man ahead of his time champion the right of 
 woman to vote and express the frustration of black person who know 
 the constitution&#x27;s acceptance of slave as fifth of a person 
 be wrong headed and counterproductive to the potential of the new 
 nation 
   douglass write about ` ` what to the slave be your of july&#x27;&#x27 

        ` ` a day that reveal to he more than all other day in 
      the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he be the 
      constant victim to he your celebration be a sham your 
      boast liberty an unholy license your national greatness 
      swell vanity your sound of rejoice be empty and 
      heartless your denunciation of tyrant brass fronted 
      impudence your shout of liberty and equality hollow 
      mockery your prayer and hymn your sermon and 
      thanksgiving with all your religious parade and solemnity 
      be to he mere bombast fraud deception impiety and 
      hypocrisy a thin veil to cover up crime which would 
      disgrace a nation of savages&#x27;&#x27 

   but frederick douglass be not bitter with america he be determine 
 to perfect america by make it well through his writing lecture 
 speech and civic activism 
   the effort at perfect this nation be small and sometimes very 
 great 
   i be happy to have contribute to this effort by introduce 
 legislation that lead to the establishment of juneteenth as a federal 
 holiday make manifest the nation&#x27;s rejection of slavery and embrace 
 of the freedom and equality of right douglass hop for 
   the work of past generation and our work today be to perfect this 
 democracy to keep the experiment go until we have make it 
 consistent with its found document 


             the preamble of the declaration of independence 

        we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be 
      create equal that they be endow by their creator with 
      certain unalienable right that among these be life 
      liberty and the pursuit of happiness.--that to secure these 
      right government be institute among men derive their 
      just power from the consent of the governed 

   to celebrate our nation&#x27;s continued existence would be hollow if we 
 do not remember and acknowledge the dedication and professionalism of 
 the man and woman in the uniform service who fill the rank of the 
 army airforce navy marines coast guard and merchant marines to 
 defend this nation 
   we also owe our thank to the nameless and faceless thousand of 
 brave and patriotic public servant who be in our nation&#x27;s 
 intelligence agency who serve in support of the mission of the 
 uniformed service through the executive office of the president 
   these brave americans know well lincoln&#x27;s lyceum speech in which he 
 warn we about the need to be vigilant in defense of our precious 
 democracy and that nothing should be take for grant about this 
 experiment 
   they know that attack and threat on our democracy should not be 
 ignore the cost of do so can be grave 
   they know like many of you that our nation be not a century old 
 when it be plunge into a civil war with brother take up arm 
 against brother where the soil and creek of battlefield turn red 
 with the life blood of warrior in conflict about which direction the 
 nation would go would it be slaveholde freedom love or would it 
 end 
   the civil war make manifest lincoln&#x27;s warning that a house divide 
 against itself can not stand 
   this of july we must rededicate ourselves to work towards a 
 system of democracy that hear the voice of all citizen no matter 
 their color gender sexual orientation country of origin or social 
 or economic status for if we do less than allow they access to the 
 ballot box where all vote be count as cast it would dishonor those 
 who fight and die over the century so that this country might 
 endure 
   and we must give thank to those who dedicate themselves to our 
 nation&#x27;s preservation for the next generation to come 
   i know that this be a nation of patriot and as we honor its birth 
 we may not celebrate in the same way but i believe that our love of 
 country be real and present in the mind and heart of the people of 
 this nation 
   self governance of a nation by the people and for the people who come 
 from such diversity be an experiment that have yet to run its course 
   while live this experiment for and year we 
 have also expand and extend the blessing of liberty to former 
 slave woman young people native americans asian pacific islanders 
 hispanics and lgbtqi+ person 
   while we be still a work in progress as each generation learn how 
 good to perfect our democracy we indeed have a great deal to be 
 thankful for this july

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday june 

   ms. mccollum mr. chair i rise in strong opposition to the state 
 foreign operations and related programs appropriation bill 
   this legislation house some of the most important diplomacy 
 development and defense initiative for the united states and the 
 world at large the program that be fund through this bill serve 
 some of the needy population in the world help million of 
 people gain access to clean water safe shelter nutritious food and 
 democracy development 
   unfortunately the bill before we today abdicate u.s. leadership in 
 all of these area it eliminate funding for the united nations and 
 underfund operation and staffing of the state department and the u.s. 
 agency for international development it cut funding for the peace 
 corps and cut a staggering $ from program that improve 
 maternal and child health around the globe 
   this bill ignore the existential threat of climate change which 
 affect the life and livelihood of family around the world 
 include here in america climate change be a know 

 page e694 

 threat to our national security yet there be no funding to help 
 community adapt to drought rise coastline or extreme heat and 
 no funding to stop deforestation or recur coastal flooding 
 additionally there be no support for adapt to renewable energy 
   even in area where we can usually find bipartisan agreement this 
 bill fall short for example the feed the future program which have 
 historically enjoy bipartisan support across multiple 
 administration receive a $ cut this program have help 
 feed child worldwide in the last year alone and have 
 help their family learn to farm sustainably and stand on their own 
 this cut will have devastating impact on child and family that 
 struggle with malnutrition and food instability 
   this be a deeply political bill that will diminish america&#x27;s 
 leadership on the world stage make it more difficult for we to 
 support our ally and deter our adversary and will ultimately 
 jeopardize our national security for these reason i ask that my 
 colleague vote against it
