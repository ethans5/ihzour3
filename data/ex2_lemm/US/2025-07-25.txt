                          friday july 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in opposition to h.r. the 
 digital asset market clarity act s. the guiding and establishing 
 national innovation in u.s. stablecoins act and h.r. the anti- 
 cbdc surveillance state act 
   while i be oppose to these bill i be not oppose to the 
 concept of crypto itself 

 page e729 

 but i have concern about how crypto be currently be regulate and 
 the financial security of my constituent who invest or store their 
 dollar in crypto rather than consider the bill before we 
 this week congress should consider legislation that put guardrail in 
 place to protect consumer prevent fraud and establish an effective 
 regulatory framework for crypto instead these h.r. s. and 
 h.r. fall short of create an effective regulatory framework 
 allow big tech and the trump family to enrich themselves and stifle 
 innovation at the federal reserve 
   now mr. speaker let i tell you a bit about what these bill 
 would do h.r. which republicans be call the clarity act 
 would carve the crypto industry out from current security law and 
 regulation this would continue to expose consumer to harmful crypto 
 practice additionally the clarity act would not only enable 
 conflict of interest from trump and his family through meme coin like 
 $ trump but it would also send the message that congress approve of 
 the way president trump be sell access to the white house that be 
 why i join congressman vindman in send a letter to the house 
 committees on financial services and agriculture express our serious 
 concern that the clarity and genius act include dangerous carveout 
 for the president and vice president from conflict of interest rule 
   s. the genius act be a bipartisan attempt at establish a 
 framework for stablecoin a type of cryptocurrency primarily use for 
 trading crypto asset transact in good and service insulate 
 against local currency instability and send payment across 
 border while s. be a step in the right direction it fail to 
 establish an effective federal framework to regulate stablecoin the 
 bill also open up a path for big tech and other commercial business 
 like meta amazon and walmart to amass consolidated power over both 
 commerce and banking service each of these corporation be explore 
 start their own stablecoin 
   finally h.r. the anti cbdc surveillance state act would 
 immediately halt and prohibit the united states from explore the 
 potential benefit of a central bank digital currency cbdc this bill 
 would stifle innovation at the federal reserve as they research and 
 develop way to meet the evolve money and payment landscape keep 
 the u.s. behind the starting line as other country race ahead and 
 compete to develop and implement cbdcs as much of our transaction 
 have move away from use the physical dollar through the increase 
 use of credit card mobile wallet and cryptocurrencie the federal 
 reserve have be research way to innovate the u.s. dollar congress 
 should not stifle the ability of the federal reserve to meet the need 
 of our evolve digital age 
   mr. speaker rather than put forward bill that fail to 
 make consumer safe and stifle innovation congress should instead 
 consider a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that will 
 promote the responsible development of these digital asset while 
 protect american consumer and investor i urge my colleague to 
 reject h.r. s. and h.r.
