                     in the house of representative 

                          tuesday june 

   ms. jackson lee mr. speaker i want to thank my colleague for 
 host this congressional black caucus special order to discuss the 
 issue at the heart of american democracy our right to vote 
   this right be fundamental to our democracy and a threat to it be a 
 threat to america itself 
   a crucial benchmark of progress and inclusion in this country have 
 be the passage of of the most important piece of legislation in 
 our nation&#x27;s history the voting rights act of 
   sign in to law by president johnson this legislation help to 
 reinforce america&#x27;s promise of a truly democratic nation and our 
 amendment prohibition on deny black americans the right to vote 
   the voting rights act serve as a beacon for full political 
 participation and engagement in our nation for all americans 
   because of that law i stand before you as congresswoman sheila 
 jackson lee the african american woman ranking member of the 
 house judiciary subcommittee on crime and a senior member on the 
 judiciary homeland security and the budget committees 
   on august in the rotunda of the capitol and in the presence 
 of such luminary as the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. and rev. 
 ralph abernathy of the southern christian leadership conference roy 
 wilkins of the naacp whitney young of the national urban league james 
 foreman of the congress of racial equality a. philip randolph of the 
 brotherhood of sleeping car porters john lewis of the student non- 
 violent coordinating committee senators robert kennedy hubert 
 humphrey and everett dirksen president johnson address the nation 
 before sign the voting rights act 
   ` ` the vote be the most powerful instrument ever devise by man for 
 break down injustice and destroy the terrible wall which 
 imprison man because they be different from other men.&#x27;&#x27 
   the voting rights act of be critical to prevent brazen voter 
 discrimination violation that historically leave million of african 
 americans disenfranchise 
   in for example only about percent of african americans 
 live in the south be register to vote 
   poll taxis literacy test and threat of violence be the major 
 cause of these racially discriminatory result 
   in the year before the voting rights act become law there be 
 approximately african americans in public office include just 
 in congress 
   few if any african americans hold elective office anywhere in the 
 south 
   because of the voting rights act today there be more than 
 black elect official include approximately member of 
 congress the large number ever 
   additionally for the time in our history we have a vice 
 president kamala d. harris the woman black person and 
 asian american to be swear into that role 
   furthermore we have the black woman ketanji brown jackson 
 serve as a justice on the u.s. supreme court 
   the voting rights act open the political process for many of the 
 approximately hispanic public official that have be elect 
 and appoint nationwide include of whom serve in congress 
   native americans asians and other who have historically encounter 
 harsh barrier to full political participation also have benefit 
 greatly 
   the crown jewel of the voting rights act of be section which 
 prohibit the implementation of voting practice or procedure that 
 discriminate on the basis of race color or membership in of the 
 language minority group identify in section 4(f)(2 of the act 
   historically section of the voting rights act provide the crucial 
 pre clearance formula a vital proactive measure to determine which 
 state and jurisdiction be require to preclear new voting law with 
 the department of justice or a federal court 
   for nearly year section of the voting rights act and the 
 preclearance formula outline in section moderate many of the 

 page e688 

 bad abuse and result in many state adopt vote law and 
 redistricting plan with an eye to satisfy the concern of minority 
 voter 
   despite section 5&#x27;s long history and crucial role in ensure our 
 democracy be by all the people and for all the people year ago 
 the supreme court make a disastrous decision that cripple the voting 
 rights act and endanger voting right nationwide 
   in its shelby county v. holder decision the supreme court 
 gutte the vra strike down section 4&#x27;s crucial preclearance formula 
 render the proactive protection of section unusable 
   no long could the voting rights act take a proactive preemptive 
 role to stop discriminatory legislation 
   since then the need to protect the right to vote and safeguard our 
 democracy have never be more urgent 
   follow the shelby county decision state legislature have 
 target voter and erect deliberate barrier to the ballot box in 
 what amount to the most concerted effort to restrict voting access in 
 generation these new restrictive discriminatory voting law have 
 include closing polling station and reduce their hour curb 
 early voting and vote by mail option impose strict id requirement 
 limit access to multi lingual voting material and make more 
 difficult to register to vote 
   accord to the brennan center for justice at least state have 
 pass restrictive voting law since the shelby county v. holder 
 decision in as of may these measure disproportionately 
 impact voter of color native american voter voter with 
 disability and the elderly 
   a brennan center report conclude that state previously cover 
 under the preclearance formula have purge voter off their roll at a 
 significantly high rate than non covered jurisdiction now that their 
 new law be no long subject to the same level of oversight 
   however threat to voting right nationwide have not stop there 
   the supreme court have continue to undermine key provision of the 
 voting rights act 
   in july in its brnovich v. dnc and arizona republican party v. 
 dnc the supreme court uphold racially discriminatory voter 
 restriction in arizona despite evidence that these law be 
 intentionally design to target latino and other minority voter 
   in do so the court far weaken the voting rights act make 
 it hard to challenge discriminatory law under section 2&#x27;s anti- 
 discrimination provision 
   yet the threat have not stop there 
   with the election approach voting right have never be 
 more important and yet have increasingly come under fire 
   since january of at least state have enact 
 restrictive law 
   some state have spend the past few year pile on restriction 
   voter in state will face new restriction that weren&#x27;t in place 
 in the last presidential election 
   these include a new law in alabama and idaho that broadly 
 criminalize certain form of assistance with absentee voting and mail 
 ballot limit vote access for elderly voter voter with 
 disability and those with limited access to transportation 
   indiana enact a law that heighten the chance that naturalize 
 citizen will be wrongly remove from the voting roll 
   a new law in tennessee restrict the time frame voter have to 
 request an absentee ballot 
   a new arizona law shorten the period during which voter may correct 
 issue with their signature on mail ballot 
   a new west virginia law now require county clerk to cancel the 
 registration of voter who get out of state driver&#x27;s license 
 create a burden on student military member and other who 
 temporarily reside outside the state but intend to return and therefore 
 remain eligible to vote in west virginia 
   in my home state of texas new restriction have be implement on 
 absentee voting and new legislation empower the state to more freely 
 purge voter roll a process that often result in legitimate voter 
 unknowingly be remove and find themselves unable to vote come 
 november 
   in the face of all these threat what can be do to preserve voting 
 right 
   crucial step be the passage of the john r. lewis voting rights 
 advancement act 
   this landmark legislation would restore and modernize the protection 
 of the voting rights act of 
   in do so it would protect the right to vote and safeguard our 
 democracy by prevent restrictive discriminatory voting law from 
 take effect 
   it do so by establish a new modern day framework to determine 
 which state and locality have a recent history of discrimination and 
 require such jurisdiction to preclear new election change prevent 
 restrictive and discriminatory voting law from take effect 
   in other word it revive and refresh the preclearance formula for 
 the modern era enable section of the voting rights act to once 
 again preemptively prevent threat to voting right 
   it also restore section of the voting rights act by eliminate 
 the heighten standard require to challenge discriminatory voting 
 law create by the supreme court in brnovich v. dnc 
   vote right should not be a partisan issue 
   it be the duty and responsibility of congress to safeguard voting 
 right across our nation 
   our freedom to vote be our most sacred and fundamental right 
   it be the right upon which all our other right rest and allow we 
 to determine the future of our community and family and ensure 
 opportunity for all 
   since enactment the voting rights act of have be reauthorize 
 time with large bipartisan majority 
   the vra&#x27;s most recent authorization occur in when it pass 
 unanimously in the u.s. senate and be sign by republican 
 president george w. bush 
   there be no reason that the effort to restore the vra to its full 
 strength should be any different 
   while republicans veer away from this bipartisan tradition last 
 congress oppose the bill in the house and block debate in the 
 senate this congress provide a new opportunity to side with the 
 american people and the fundamental principle that everyone have an 
 equal opportunity to have their voice hear and vote count 
   we must reject the cynicism that republicans at the high level 
 have espouse when talk about make vote more accessible for all 
   allow every eligible vote to be cast and count be not a ` ` power 
 grab.&#x27;&#x27 
   for democracy to work for all of we it must include we all no 
 matter our background 
   the john r. lewis voting rights advancement act would restore and 
 modernize the essential portion of the voting rights act that block 
 discriminatory voting policy before they go into effect create a 
 transparent process for protect everyone&#x27;s freedom to vote 
   i have also repeatedly introduce legislation that further enshrine 
 our voting right 
   h.r. -the coretta scott king mid decade redistricting prohibition 
 act prohibit a state where the congressional district have be 
 redistricte after a decennial census from carry out another 
 redistricting until after the next apportionment of representatives 
 follow a decennial census unless a court require the state to 
 conduct a subsequent redistricting to comply with the constitution or 
 enforce the voting rights act of 
   this legislation be also a response to the shelby county decision 
 as after the census many state legislature redrew aggressive new 
 measure now that they be no long subject to preclearance 
   for example republicans in north carolina convert a congressional 
 map that elect republicans and democrats into that could 
 elect republicans and just democrats 
   the north carolina map be skew in a way that target black 
 political power mean that a state that be percent black could 
 have only a single black member of congress represent they 
   congressional map in texas ohio and georgia be also all 
 consider severe partisan gerrymander 
   this redistricting cycle also see unprecedented effort to undermine 
 the political power of black hispanic asian and native community 
 especially in southern state 
   while redistricting after a new census be almost always a partisan 
 process this bill protect the redistricting process from be 
 employ too often to skew the map even far 
   under h.r. once the redistricting be complete after the new 
 census the state&#x27;s map can not be redrawn again until the next census 
 unless a court mandate otherwise 
   like the john lewis voting rights advancement act this be another 
 vital piece of legislation that should receive broad support from my 
 colleague as it enshrine voting right nationwide and preserve the 
 legacy of the voting rights act 
   mr. speaker for million of americans the right to vote protect 
 by the voting rights act of be a sacred treasure earn by the 
 sweat and toil and tear and blood of ordinary americans who show the 
 world it be possible to accomplish extraordinary thing 
   let we honor their commitment and sacrifice by enshrine the 
 legislative protection they fight for
