                     in the house of representative 

                        wednesday april 

   mr. wilson of south carolina mr. speaker last week vice president 
 j.d. vance with his indian american wife usha achieve a global 
 recalibration for energy independence meeting with america&#x27;s 
 appreciated ally prime minister narendra modi 
   it be an extraordinary recognition of the positive impact of indian- 
 americans that the lady of america be an indian american 
 herself 
   american partnership have never be more important with the world&#x27;s 
 old democracy ally with the world&#x27;s large democracy 
   an excellent analysis of this energy achievement be provide in the 
 daily threat status newsletter from the washington times on april 
 by vijay jayaraj of the co2 coalition in fairfax virginia 


                                 opinion 

        in a landmark move that may well redefine the future of 
      u.s.-india trade relation and global energy geopolitic 
      vice president j.d. vance announce a new trade deal with 
      india the day after he meet with indian prime minister 
      narendra modi on april mr. vance say the country 
      have ` ` officially finalize the term of reference for the 
      trade negotiation.&#x27;&#x27 
        the deal initiate against the backdrop of president 
      trump&#x27;s tariff threat could be a masterstroke of economic 
      diplomacy mr. trump&#x27;s announcement of a day pause on 
      reciprocal tariff which could have raise duty on indian 
      export give india a window to negotiate 
        the energy economic of this deal and its potential to 
      reshape the global market for fossil fuel be fascinating 
      in his announcement mr. vance declare ` ` we want to sell 
      more energy to india and also help it explore its resource 
      include offshore natural gas reserve and critical mineral 
      supplies.&#x27;&#x27 
        the arrangement could propel india toward its long stand 
      goal of energy surplus this feat appear daunt perhaps 
      impossible against the nation&#x27;s projection for a massive 
      increase in demand the fast grow among major economy 
      for the next decade 
        let&#x27;s get it straight india have a long way to go before it 
      even contemplate reduce its consumption of hydrocarbon 
      even a middle class indian like i reside in a major city 
      experience power blackout regularly which be precisely why 
      the nation have postpone net ambition to a distant 
      even the document for the country&#x27;s participation in 
      the nutty united nations paris agreement prioritize domestic 
      energy security over international climate diplomacy 
        india&#x27;s reliance on import energy which include more 
      than of its crude oil and roughly of its natural gas 
      pose a strategic vulnerability the government aim to more 
      than double natural gas&#x27 share of the energy mix to by 
      u.s. liquefy natural gas supplier have surpass the 
      united arab emirates to become india&#x27;s large lng 
      supplier trail only qatar 
        a key player in this unfold saga be gail ltd. india&#x27;s 
      state own natural gas company on april gail issue a 
      tender to procure metric ton per annum of lng from 
      an exist or new u.s. lng liquefaction project with 
      operation commence by the agreement potentially 
      extendable by to year signal india&#x27;s commitment to 
      u.s. supply 
        gail have to stall a similar process in to buy a stake 
      in a u.s. lng plant after president biden ban export 
      permit for lng project the ban be lift only after the 
      trump administration return to the white house 
        the timing of the upcoming deal be notable strengthen 
      india&#x27;s position as a counterweight to china the quad 
      alliance comprise the u.s. india japan and australia-- 
      gain heft as india bolster its energy security and economic 
      clout 
        as mr. vance emphasize the u.s. willingness to share 
      technology and expertise could enhance indian autonomy 
      reduce reliance on adversarial supplier this alignment be 
      particularly crucial as china intensify its trade outreach 
      in southeast asia and seek to blunt the effect of u.s. 
      tariff 
        the western medium will decry the expansion of fossil fuel 
      trading as a climate catastrophe as though that would 
      resonate with a serious person the u.s.-india deal wisely 
      eschew climate moralizing and embrace a symbiotic truth 
      america&#x27;s shale boom and india&#x27;s hunger for energy perfectly 
      match 
        this deal reaffirm energy sovereignty perhaps it mark 
      the beginning of a global recalibration in which nation 
      rediscover the courage to assert their right to energy 
      abundance and economic self determination without apologize 
      to the corrupt and decrepit climate cartel of brussels davos 
      and u.n. corridor 
        may the new world order feature develop nation stand 
      for their future and reject the false campaign of 
      planetary salvation
