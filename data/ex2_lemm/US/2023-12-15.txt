   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in opposition to h. res 
 republicans&#x27 baseless attempt to distract from the ongoing criminal 
 proceeding against former president donald trump 
   after a year of frivolous investigation produce no evidence of 
 wrongdoing by president biden republicans bring to the floor a 
 resolution direct committee to pursue a sham impeachment inquiry 
 this resolution be clearly an attempt to minimize and distract from 
 former president trump&#x27;s high crime and misdemeanor during the same 
 week that his criminal trial proceeding reach the u.s. supreme court 
   while house republicans have spend the year waste time and taxpayer 
 dollar democrats have deliver the vote to prevent a government 
 shutdown not once but twice this body have a duty to keep the 
 government function and open for the american people yet 
 republicans time and time again have show no interest in meet that 
 obligation 
   as we approach the halfway point of the congress it be clear 
 the majority would rather spend their time distract the american 
 people with their extreme maga message instead of do the serious 
 work of legislate it be past time for house republicans to start 
 address the serious and urgent need of all our constituent
