   mr. scott of virginia mr. speaker i rise today in support of the 
 brave and selfless member of our nation&#x27;s coast guard i also rise to 
 urge my colleague to join i in work to develop america&#x27;s maritime 
 and shipbuilde workforce to meet the grow demand of the offshore 
 wind industry 
   i be concerned that the coast guard reauthorization act which be a 
 critical piece of legislation include language that would be 
 detrimental to the bud domestic offshore wind industry if enact 
 without change this bill would significantly slow our transition to 
 clean renewable and domestic energy we have see this worrisome 
 provision before numerous stakeholder then and now have express 
 concern that crew requirement on globally rare vessel that be 
 already in high demand would make it all but impossible for offshore 
 wind project to move forward in the near term 
   while i certainly share the goal of expand opportunity for 
 american mariner in offshore wind farm construction this jeopardize 
 job in offshore wind manufacturing as well as job that will last 
 decade in offshore wind turbine operation and maintenance while i 
 plan to vote for this legislation due to the important work of our 
 nation&#x27;s coast guard i urge my colleague to work together and remove 
 this shortsighted provision 
   last spring in the interest of find a path to empower american 
 worker without threaten progress in the near term i introduce the 
 offshore wind american manufacturing act this act require the u.s. 
 government accountability office gao to conduct a study to inform 
 public and private investment in shipbuilding and workforce training to 
 support the biden administration&#x27;s goal of deploy gigawatt of 
 offshore wind energy by the study would also identify way that 
 current policy could be strengthen to support 

 page e542 

 american worker include new opportunity for american mariner 
 interested in instal offshore wind on the outer continental shelf 
   this study be a pragmatic approach that balance our responsibility 
 to reduce emission and support american worker and mariner thank 
 to momentum generate by the passage of the inflation reduction act 
 offshore wind have the potential to catalyze major investment in 
 american manufacturing and shipbuilding by study opportunity to 
 maximize the role of american mariner and shipbuilder in meet

                          tuesday may 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 public defender service technical correction act which would fix a 
 drafting error in the further consolidated appropriations act 
 unless fix this error will force the d.c. public defender service 
 pds to close day per week begin in mid june through the rest 
 of the current fiscal year i very much appreciate that senator chris 
 van hollen will be introduce the bill in the senate i also 
 appreciate that he file an amendment on the senate floor to the faa 
 reauthorization act of to fix this error but be disappointed that 
 the senate do not take it up 
   pds be independent of the d.c. government be exclusively fund by 
 the federal government and its employee be deem federal employee 
 for purpose of federal benefit the further consolidated 
 appropriations act provide pds $ in fiscal year 
 the same funding level pds receive in fiscal year however the 
 further consolidated appropriations act require pds to spend $ 
 of its appropriation on office relocation expense even though 
 pds have already relocate office before the bill be enact pds 
 need the authority to spend that $ on salary or it will be 
 force to close day per week my bill would give pds the authority 
 to spend that $ on salary 
   the drafting error will not only harm pds employee who will not be 
 pay when pds be closed it will also harm the local criminal justice 
 system in d.c. on the day that pds be closed pds attorney will not 
 appear in any matter before the d.c. superior court the d.c. court of 
 appeals the u.s. parole commission or other administrative or 
 adjudicative body the local d.c. court system be already face a 
 backlog of case because of a shortage of judge who be appoint by 
 the president subject to senate confirmation the pds furlough will 
 only exacerbate this problem this be simply an unacceptable result 
 especially when it will have be cause by what everyone acknowledge 
 be a drafting error and not a deliberate cut to pds&#x27;s funding 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill

   in congress pass the law enforcement officer safety act 
 leosa permit qualified active and retired law enforcement 
 officer to carry conceal firearm and ammunition in certain place 
   every state allow the conceal carry of firearm subject to certain 
 condition but the original leosa overrode whatever permit training 
 or other requirement might be in place with important commonsense 
 exception for national parks playground government building 
 private property and other sensitive area 
   i should note that i be a member of the house judiciary committee 
 when it pass the original leosa in 
   at that time the committee be under republican control but it 
 still follow regular order 
   we hold a hearing on the bill in which we hear from several law 
 enforcement organization 
   some express support for the bill as a way for officer to protect 
 themselves and be able to respond to a dangerous situation whether they 
 be in their home jurisdiction or not on duty or off duty active or 
 retire 
   other law enforcement organization oppose the legislation 
 express concern about create confusion in the field that might 
 even endanger law enforcement 
   while some of my colleague on both side of the aisle express 
 concern about the original leosa i be satisfied that it strike an 
 appropriate balance 
   i support the original leosa because it include limit for special 
 place 
   it have exception so that state would still have some control over 
 whether retired and off duty law enforcement officer would be allow 
 to carry conceal weapon in place like park playground gun free 
 school zone and state and local government building 
   state should be allow to regulate these place consistent with the 
 need of the state 
   allow they to do so protect local law enforcement by make sure 
 they know what to expect when respond to a scene 
   the original leosa also respect the right of private property 
 owner to prohibit conceal weapon on their property if they choose to 
 do so 
   and with respect to retire officer it ensure that they would 
 continue to receive annual firearm training so that they would know 
 how to safely use the conceal firearm that they be carry 
   the legislation before we today however upset the balance strike 
 by the original leosa and it be be advance without a hearing that 
 would help we fully evaluate its strength and weakness 
   while i support the original leosa i oppose the legislation before 
 we today because it would allow more conceal weapon in park 
 playground gun free school zone local government building and on 
 private property even when it be contrary to the judgment of state 
 leader and private property owner 
   today&#x27;s bill also weaken the training standard for retire officer 
 as set forth in the original leosa which be especially concern 
   marksmanship be a perishable skill that must be renew through 
 practice and training 
   by relax the training standard today&#x27;s bill would allow retired 
 officer to carry conceal firearm despite it be as many as 
 year since they last receive training and it could be that they 
 retire from law enforcement more year before that 
   i respect the right of lawful and responsible gun owner include 
 the right of retired and off duty law enforcement 
   we should allow these individual to carry conceal weapon into 
 many place provide they meet certain qualification include 
 regular training 
   but this bill would allow conceal weapon to be carry by those 
 who have not receive recent training 
   and it would allow conceal firearm in space where a state may 
 have a valid public safety interest in prohibit they 
   for these reason i must oppose this legislation and i urge my 
 colleague to vote no on this bill

                           friday may 

   ms. jackson lee mr. speaker i rise to speak in opposition to h. 
 res ` ` a resolution regard violence against law enforcement 
 officers&#x27;&#x27 
   sadly h. res be another hypocritical partisan attack cloak 
 behind a message honor local law enforcement during national police 
 week 

 page e541 

   the resolution be full of misinformation baseless and dangerous 
 claim and political rhetoric that overwhelm its intend purpose and 
 have no place in what should be an opportunity to bring congress 
 together in solemn reflection 
   my republican colleague have consistently try to blame the rise in 
 violent crime on democrats and locally elect district attorneys and 
 with this resolution have attempt once again to label democrats as 
 the party of ` ` defund the police.&#x27;&#x27 
   the resolution assert without evidence that call to defund the 
 police be tie to an increase in violence against law enforcement 
 officer and far imply that locally adopt progressive criminal 
 justice reform policy have contribute to the ` ` negative 
 environment&#x27;&#x27 in which law enforcement officer work 
   the resolution fail to acknowledge that the number of officer 
 kill in the line of duty decrease substantially each year from 
 in to in 
   the resolution advance baseless political attack against policy 
 aim at address decade of mass incarceration and 
 overcriminalization attempt to link policy such as decrease 
 criminal penalty and no cash bail system with an increase in 
 aggression and violence toward law enforcement 
   the resolution claim that house member be responsible for 
 exemplify a respect for the rule of law and for law enforcement but 
 overlook hypocritical anti police republican action 
   the failure of republicans to unanimously vote to award the 
 congressional gold medal to all police officer who respond to the 
 violent january attack on the capitol and effort like h. con res 
 to marginalize federal law enforcement officer 
   republican effort to defund law enforcement whether by oppose 
 grant funding that support state and local agency or by call to 
 abolish federal agency such as the federal bureau of investigations 
 fbi the department of homeland security dhs and the bureau of 
 alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf 
    for these reason i must oppose this fatally flawed resolution and 
 yet another miss opportunity to support and honor law enforcement 
 personnel across the country and those who lose their life in the line 
 of duty without engage in partisanship on this solemn occasion
