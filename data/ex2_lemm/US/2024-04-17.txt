   mr. castro of texas mr. speaker i rise concern my vote on h.r. 
 and h.r. on april 
   with regard to h.r. i fully support the use of the foreign 
 direct product rule to restrict iran&#x27;s ability to develop weapon 
 technology especially technology use by iran for its april 
 attack on israel however h.r. would represent a 
 counterproductive restriction of the flexibility that have enable the 
 commerce department to effectively restrict iran&#x27;s access to material 
 and technology that can be use to produce drone and missile while i 
 have no concern about expand the application of the foreign direct 
 product rule to include the additional category enumerate within the 
 bill i believe this expansion must be do in coordination with u.s. 
 partner to avoid create an outcome that hurt our ally without 
 address iranian proliferation this bill would threaten 
 relationship with key partner include the united kingdom 
 australia canada and other that have allow the united states to 
 effectively counter malign action by the iranian government and i 
 vote no as a result 
   with regard to h.r. i vote no out of concern that section of 
 the bill could result in reciprocal action from iran to restrict the 
 travel of iranians to the united states prevent asylum seeker and 
 other from escape iran&#x27;s authoritarian government the bill would 
 additionally prevent thousand of iranian americans from be able to 
 visit family in iran and similarly restrict visa by journalist 
 educator and other visitor who contribute to positive connection 
 between the people of iran and the outside world i also oppose 
 provision in section of h.r. that would break with decade of 
 diplomatic precedent and undermine u.s. capacity to negotiate with iran 
 by restrict how iranian government official can travel to the 
 united states to attend meeting at the united nations headquarters in 
 new york city
