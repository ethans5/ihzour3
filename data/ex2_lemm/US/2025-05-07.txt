      smuggler set out to cross the border from nazi occupy 
      northern france into french control southern france so- 
      call vichy france but still equally dangerous for jews 
      instead of help she cross the border the smuggler 
      betray she and she be arrest she be then send to 
      drancy an infamous rail juncture and hold town just north 
      of paris from there its prisoner be transport to 
      concentration or death camp 
        grandmother and i stay hide in my mother&#x27;s apartment 
      for a year never leave for fear of be arrest or 
      bad i go out alone to get food every day i stand in 
      line unable to conceal my star of david and because of it 
      i be curse as a ` ` dirty jew.&#x27;&#x27 from our window we see 
      other family be pull from their apartment and haul 
      away in truck 
        in august grandmother decide we have to flee paris 
      we obtain false identity paper with new name and equally 
      false personal information we depart from paris on an 
      overnight train that would pass through border control 
      checkpoint the under german control the under 
      french i decide to take charge for we since grandmother 
      speak with a thick polish accent a giveaway i tell she to 
      pretend she be asleep when the german soldier come to 
      check our paper i ask they not to wake she they 
      comply at the checkpoint control by the french 
      i make the same request miraculously it work we get 
      through in all those year of live in near unbearable 
      fear none have be more terrifying than those border 
      passing i couldn&#x27;t stop shake for hour after 
        i be year old 
        we find our way to the small and remote mountain town of 
      voiron in east central france my aunt and young cousin have 
      successfully make the same journey to a nearby town 
      grandmother and i find a place to stay in what i recall as a 
      warehouse we have no furniture but a kind neighbor give we a 
      mattress a small cook stove which help keep we warm 
      and other utensil 
        i find a job run a small grocery i be pay meager 
      wage grandmother mend clothing and barter her wine 
      ration for food we scour the nearby forest for chestnut 
      and firewood my only warm dress make from a blanket be 
      destroy beyond use by mouse 
        deliverance finally come with the liberation of voiron in 
      august by american soldier the ` ` great 
      generation,&#x27;&#x27 the generation of many of your grandparent 
      they give we cracker chocolate and of all thing chew 
      gum something i&#x27;d never know but above all they give we 
      freedom still i have no knowledge of my mother&#x27;s fate i 
      keep hop she would come back she never do later i 
      learn what happen at drancy she have volunteer to 
      accompany a trainload of child to auschwitz mile 
      east a horrific journey of several day and night they 
      be pack into freight car like animal no water no 
      food no sanitation no window no place to sit let alone 
      room to lie down all this be in the heat of august upon 
      arrival all who survive the journey be murder in gas 
      chamber such be my mother&#x27;s fate 
        she be year old 
        it be always difficult for i to tell my story but i be 
      compel to tell it because of the global surge in 
      antisemitism include here in the united states while it 
      be reassure that our government in your hand be 
      address it at the high level it be troubling that it 
      have to be address at all it doesn&#x27;t take much history to 
      teach we that what start with hatred of the jewish people 
      do not end there 
        what be the condition that nurture antisemitism 
      ignorance intolerance indifference injustice that be why 
      holocaust education be so vital that be why this country 
      must again lead this fight as it have do for just cause so 
      often and so nobly in the past
