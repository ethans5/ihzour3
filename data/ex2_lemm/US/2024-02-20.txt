                        tuesday february 

   mr. mcgovern mr. speaker today i would like to include in the 
 record an important article from consumer advocate lawyer and author 
 ralph nader that celebrate the determination and courage of citizen 
 activist like nadia milleron nadia&#x27;s daughter samya rose stumo 
 tragically die in a plane crash when the defective boeing max she 
 be in crash in ethiopia on march kill all people 
 on board nadia be determined to fight for justice and successfully 
 push for action to ensure that the family of victim of such 
 tragedy could collect punitive damage her story be an inspiration 
 that should be read by all as a reminder that in our democracy 
 person truly can make a difference 

               that lady from new england who sham we all 

                              ralph nader 

        the mass media be reluctant to recognize civic hero 
      unless they display physical bravely such as rush into a 
      burning building to save a child the medium also lavish 
      vast coverage on sport hero and entertainer 

 page e164 

        unnoticed by the mass media be how it come about that the 
      illinois legislature overcome by corporate lobbyist pass 
      legislation allow punitive damage for wrongful death 
      disaster and send the bill to illinois governor j.b. 
      pritzker who sign it last friday 
        in the word of state lawmaker this effort start 
      with ` ` that lady from new england who drive down here to 
      springfield illinois and sham we all.&#x27;&#x27 that lady be my 
      niece nadia milleron who lose her daughter samya rose 
      stumo an emerge leader in global health to the defective 
      boeing max that crash in ethiopia on march 
      kill all people on board early on october 
      a similar also new boeing max crash off 
      indonesia&#x27;s coast kill all passenger and crew 
        nadia be determined that family in the future who lose 
      their love one to reckless corporate action and crime 
      would not be tell by illinois court that be people 
      render disabled they could collect punitive damage but 
      not if their life be take the cruel absurdity of this 
      perverse rule that let company escape punitive damage 
      under the law of tort wrongful injury if their 
      recklessness or greed kill their victim but not if they 
      injure they be too much for nadia to tolerate 
        drive by her love of samya and her determination to end 
      this gross injustice she spend month away from her 
      massachusetts home in get appointment with every 
      illinois assembly person--177 of they to plead her case in 
      person none of the naysayer she encounter in the lobbying 
      circle around the legislature deter she not even some 
      plaintiff trial lawyer 
        by the sheer force of her legal and factual argument her 
      moral authority and a few senior political advisor in 
      chicago she lay the groundwork for action early last 
      year the illinois wrongful death act be champion by a 
      young african american state lawmaker rep. la shawn k. ford 
      once it start move through the assembly with little 
      medium attention it gain momentum among the new assembly 
      leadership that carry through to the new leadership of the 
      state senate both legislative houses be control by 
      democrats 
        nadia come to this challenge in illinois where the stumo 
      family civil tort litigation against boeing be pende with 
      experience in battle the giant boeing corporation&#x27;s power 
      to get its way in washington dc for month after boeing&#x27;s 
      homicide in ethiopia see september news release 
      from the house committee on transportation nadia and her 
      husband mike both non practicing lawyer with the help of 
      their articulate son and other relentless bereaved 
      family work the corridor and office of congress 
      press for public hearing and legislation their effort 
      punctuate by public demonstration culminate in the 
      passage of federal legislation to start the process of 
      strengthen air safety regulation 
        the stumos and their family network also focus on the 
      derelict faa which over the year have transform itself 
      from a suppose aviation safety regulator to a weak 
      consultant&#x27;s role the agency literally delegate regulatory 
      decision and inspection to deputize boeing employee on 
      the factory floor and in the design office boeing and other 
      aircraft manufacturer make sure that congress do not object 
      and indeed have congress facilitate this delegation include 
      by keep the faa&#x27;s regulatory budget and skilled staff too 
      small to regulate directly and forcefully 
        nonetheless with astute and newsworthy press conference 
      and accurate responsiveness to medium inquiry the family 
      push the faa to be a little more hand on and probe than 
      it be up to 
        when the punitive damage bill pass the illinois 
      legislature governor pritzker have day to either sign it 
      or let it become law he choose to sign it on august 
      without any ceremony without have nadia the young 
      assemblyman ford and other senior state lawmaker by his 
      side have he make it an event he would have memorably 
      convey the key motivating belief in a democracy that 
      person can make a difference 
        citizen nadia blaze the way sham the foot drag 
      illinois trial lawyers association itla into jump on the 
      bandwagon in springfield once the bill&#x27;s momentum grow 
        on february i write a letter to the president of 
      the illinois trial lawyers association patrick a. salvi ii 
      wonder why the itla hadn&#x27;t push this initiative over 
      many past year and urge they to ` ` make the maximum effort 
      to secure passage.&#x27;&#x27 trial lawyer associations do not usually 
      answer letter but this get through with copy to 
      other interested party see the letter here 
        our country over time have be help immeasurably by 
      outraged mother and father turn their unabating 
      mourning over the loss of their child into laser beam 
      intensity behind health and safety law to save other parent 
      and child from similar tragedy note e.g. mother 
      against drunk driving 
        these civic hero defy all odd to challenge and prevail 
      the odd don&#x27;t faze they they have a high calling to 
      achieve 
        unfortunately neither governor pritzker nor the mass medium 
      seize this dramatic moment for exemplary recognition the 
      law however now be on the book to further more humane and 
      deterrent purpose thank ` ` to that lady from new england 
      who sham we all.&#x27;&#x27
