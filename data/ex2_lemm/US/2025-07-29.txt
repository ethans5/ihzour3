                          tuesday july 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 national guard commanding general residency act which would require 
 the commanding general of the district of columbia national guard to 
 reside in d.c. congresses ago the house committee on oversight and 
 reform pass this bill 
   the president control the d.c. national guard in contrast 
 governor of the state and the territory that have national 
 guards each control their national guards 
   the commanding general of the d.c. national guard be the top official 
 in the d.c. national guard be appoint by the president and be a 
 federal employee there be residency requirement for government 
 official in federal law d.c. law and the law of jurisdiction 
 throughout the country in fact several state have law that require 
 the top official in their national guard to reside in the state and it 
 be highly likely that every state and territory only appoint resident 
 as the top official in their national guard the primary reason 
 residency requirement exist be so that government official have a 
 connection to the resident they serve and knowledge of the unique 
 issue and challenge face by resident 
   congress have justifiably require certain federal official to reside 
 in the jurisdiction to which they be appoint include u.s. 
 district court judge u.s. marshals and u.s. attorneys similarly 
 congress which control the local d.c. court system have justifiably 
 require local d.c. judge and member of the d.c. judicial nomination 
 commission and the d.c. commission on judicial disabilities and tenure 
 to reside in d.c. 
   there be no reason that the commanding general of the d.c. national 
 guard a federal entity that serve d.c. resident and that have both a 
 military and law enforcement role should not be require to reside in 
 d.c. a d.c. residency requirement for the commanding general of the 
 d.c. national guard will lead to a well relationship between the d.c. 
 national guard and d.c. resident and be a matter of fairness for d.c. 
 resident 
   the d.c. mayor should control the d.c. national guard until then i 
 urge my colleague to support this bill
