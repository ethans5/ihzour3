     applicability of the airline deregulation act to state workers&#x27

                            hon lance gooden 

                                 of texas 

                     in the house of representative 

                          friday august 

   mr. gooden of texas mr. speaker i rise today to discuss an 
 important issue to both our nation&#x27;s employer and their employee and 
 that be regard the applicability of the airline deregulation act 
 ada to state workers&#x27 compensation program when congress enact 
 the ada in of the main goal be to place maximum reliance on 
 competitive market force to help low price and improve efficiency 
 innovation variety and competition in the delivery of air 
 transportation service 
   but the ada be never intend to prohibit state from regulate 
 workers&#x27 compensation system 
   in my home state of texas there have be litigation on this issue 
 for over a decade and there be no end in sight that be why congress 
 need to step in and why i file amendment to h.r. the 
 securing growth and robust leadership in american aviation act 
   my amendment which unfortunately be not able to be make in order as 
 part of the house&#x27;s consideration of h.r. would have amend the 
 airline deregulation act to clarify that the original intent of the ada 
 be not to preempt state workers&#x27 compensation law with respect to 
 billing and payment for air ambulance service 
   the foundation of the state workers&#x27 compensation system be 
 individual state regulation of reimbursement amount under their 
 workers&#x27 compensation medical fee schedule thereby create cost 
 transparency in most state this be accomplish by set workers&#x27 
 compensation medical fee service at a percentage above what provider 
 receive under medicare 
   as a result workers&#x27 compensation coverage be widely available to 
 employer of every size across all industry and ensure employee 
 be protect from the economic impact of workplace injury 
   unfortunately the protection and certainty this system afford both 
 employer and worker alike start to be undermine in when 
 numerous air ambulance service provider begin assert the ada 
 preempt state workers&#x27 compensation medical fee schedule create a 
 pathway for air ambulance fee to unreasonably skyrocket 
   the preemption of state workers&#x27 compensation law within the ada be 
 a pure accident when congress pass the ada in to deregulate the 
 airline industry it certainly do not intend to deregulate workers&#x27 
 compensation insurance payment to air ambulance company 
   as part of the faa reauthorization act congress establish the 
 air ambulance and patient billing advisory committee at the department 
 of transportation to address several issue involve air ambulance 
 company include medical fee consumer choice and protect 
 consumer from balance billing in march the advisory committee 
 submit its report to congress which include a recommendation to 
 amend the ada to clarify that it do not preempt state law relate 
 to state regulation of workers&#x27 compensation insurance program 
   my propose amendment to h.r. embody the advisory committee&#x27;s 
 recommendation and will address the accidental preemption of state 
 workers&#x27 compensation law and the inadvertent federalization of a part 
 of state workers&#x27 compensation system this simple clarification that 
 the ada preemption provision do not apply to state workers&#x27 
 compensation payment for air ambulance service will return the issue 
 to the state where it belong and air ambulance company will have 
 every opportunity to make their argument on the appropriate payment 
 amount for their service within each state&#x27;s workers&#x27 compensation 
 system 
   unfortunately my amendment be not include in the bill that be 
 consider by the house but i will continue to work with other member 
 on legislation to address this important issue

                     in the house of representative 

                          friday august 

   ms. jackson lee mr. speaker as a senior member of the congressional 
 black caucus i must shed light on the grow public safety concern 
 regard gun violence 
   in firearm injury be the lead cause of death in the 
 united states of america 
   every day americans be kill with gun 
   and each year hundred of law enforcement officer lose their life 
 to gun violence have be shoot to death while protect their 
 community 
   our government&#x27;s continue lack of proactivity towards prevent gun 
 violence have lead to countless unnecessary death 
   countless life have be cut far too short and countless family 
 have have to experience the excruciating pain of know their love 
 will never make it back home 
   and although gun violence affect we all i would like to highlight 
 the disproportionate effect of gun violence on black community 
   black americans be time more likely than white americans to die 
 by gun homicide 
   black americans be time more likely than white americans to 
 be fatally shoot by police 
   and while black americans make up percent of the united states 
 population in they be the victim in percent of all gun 
 homicide 
   accord to the american progress ` ` this be due to a combination of 
 weak gun law systemic racial inequity include unequal access to 
 safe housing and adequate educational and employment opportunity and 
 a history of disinvestment in public infrastructure and service in the 
 community of color most affect by gun violence.&#x27;&#x27 
   discriminatory and unjust policy and practice such as slavery and 
 jim crow be the reason that black community be still struggle to 
 overcome the inequity in our society today 
   time and time again our country have force black americans to pay the 
 price for its sin cause countless life to be lose in the process 
   instead of acknowledge this public safety concern our government 
 continue to choose to remain ignorant craft a narrative of a war 
 on the amendment 
   so allow i to be clear i support the amendment 
   but i will not sit idly by and hear the abuse of the far right&#x27;s 
 interpretation of the amendment 
   in june the supreme court take a radical step when it rule in 
 new york state rifle amp pistol association inc. v. bruen that the right 
 to carry a weapon or self defense extend to outside the home 
   in this case plaintiff challenge the year old new york state 
 handgun licensing law require individual to show proper cause before 
 they can be license to carry a conceal weapon in public 
   the court ultimately rule new york&#x27;s conceal carry law 
 unconstitutional extend the right to own a gun for self defense in 
 the home to exist outside the home as well 
   this decision alter the well establish test for evaluate gun 
 safety law and threaten the life of million around the country 
   the court&#x27;s decision shed light to a grow misinterpretation of 
 the amendment 
   as both a legislature and a legal scholar i must point out that the 
 amendment be not absolute 
   no where in the amendment do it prohibit regulate gun 
   how dare we sit by when life be be lose and act as though there 
 be nothing we can do 
   be there no sense of responsibility to provide restriction to save 
 life 
   our role in congress be to ensure that we utilize every tool 
 available to we to keep our city safe 
   we need to reimagine public safety by hold law enforcement 
 officer who violate the public trust accountable use public health 
 resource to address mental health crisis and ensure all community 
 be not overpolice well resource with access to job opportunity 
 affordable childcare and capable social service to improve the 
 quality of life 
   we need to increase the use of civilian responder deploy to 
 incident involve mental health concern and disturbance or 
 dispute 
   we need to strengthen governmental agency dedicate to violence 
 intervention and neighborhood safety 
   we need to pass legislation such as h.r. the kimberly vaughn 
 firearm safe storage act a bill i introduce which establish good 
 practice for safe firearm storage to protect americans especially 
 child from improperly store or misuse firearm 
   we need to pass legislation such as h.r. the gun violence 
 reduction resources act of which will work to hire additional 
 bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosive agent and 
 investigator to enforce gun law 
   we need to focus on mental health and pass legislation such as h.r. 
 the mental health access and gun violence prevention act which will 
 authorize funding to increase 

 page e757 

 access to mental health care treatment to reduce gun violence 
   these bill be particularly important as it pertain to mental 
 health give the following fact 
   suicide be the lead cause of gun relate death in america 
   more than percent of death by gun in the country be the result 
 of individual use these weapon as a means to commit suicide 
   approximately in american adult have a mental illness and nearly 
 half of all adult in america will develop at least mental illness 
 during their lifetime 
   less than half of child and adult with diagnosable mental health 
 problem receive the treatment they need 
   gun violence be a nonpartisan issue with bipartisan solution 
   we act as though our hand be tie behind our back despite the 
 countless option at our disposal 
   i join my cbc colleague in advance common sense bill that work to 
 prevent gun violence 
   protect our community and protect our family need to be 
 priority
