  oppose critical mineral consistency act h.r. and harnessing

                     in the house of representative 

                        monday november 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker the critical mineral consistency act h.r. 
 and the harnessing energy at thermal sources heats act h.r. 
 would both limit the ability of the american public to have a say 
 in protect our public land and determine how our natural 
 resource be use 
   h.r. give cover for the copper industry to gain access to tax 
 credit and expedite permit process only critical mineral on 
 the u.s. geological service usgs list can access these federal 
 support and we should not be play politic with that process 
   foreign own mining conglomerate stand to benefit the most from 
 this legislation as they seek to fasttrack copper mine like those 
 that threaten the watershed of the boundary waters wilderness in 
 minnesota or the sacred site of oak flats in arizona these company 
 will have no obligation to contribute to our domestic supply with the 
 mineral they pull out of our public land but our surround 
 community will bear the cost of pollution that all copper mine 
 create the least we can do be ensure the public and our federal 
 government have the full opportunity to review these mine 
   the american public should also not be subsidize new copper mine 
 when we have secure supply chain that meet our need as determine by 
 the usgs the usgs list of critical mineral intentionally differ in 
 important way from the department of energy&#x27;s list of critical 
 material mineral only make it on to the usgs list if their supply 
 chain be at risk of disruption the tax credit that congress pass to 
 encourage the development of at risk critical mineral should not go to 
 support the copper industry when the u.s. be already a global top 
 producer and a top exporter of copper 
   the other bill under consideration today the heats act would 
 completely exempt certain geothermal project that impact subsurface 
 federal resource from the environmental review process if less than 
 half of a geothermal project be non federal that mean that if a 
 project start on private land but drill underground into publicly 
 own area it would not have to abide by the federal regulation 
   i want to be clear that geothermal be an important renewable energy 
 source and that advance geothermal energy be a worthy goal that be 
 why the house have already pass bipartisan legislation and the biden 
 administration have streamline the process for certain category of 
 geothermal project i secure community project funding for a 
 geothermal heat pump to replace the inefficient natural gas base 
 system at st. paul&#x27;s como park zoo and conservatory however we must 
 ensure that when geothermal project impact our federal resource they 
 go through our federal review process the bureau of land management 
 who overseas our federal subsurface area be concerned that this bill 
 would undermine their ability to ensure public safety to uphold 
 environmental law to consult with tribal nation and to fulfill 
 their core mission of manage our natural resource for multiple use 
   i urge my colleague to join i in oppose both these misguided 
 bill and protect public review of project that impact our public 
 resource
