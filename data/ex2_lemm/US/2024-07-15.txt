                     in the house of representative 

                          monday july 

   mr. edwards mr. speaker i include in the record the follow 
 newsletter to give an update to my constituent on issue surround 
 our nato partner and election integrity 

        dear friend as a member of the house appropriations state 
      foreign operations and related programs subcommittee i 
      recently travel with a small delegation to the baltic 
      states of estonia latvia lithuania then poland there we 
      meet with those nations&#x27 top military and political leader 
      and diplomat throughout this trip i be constantly remind 
      of the evil that have reign our earth for century 
        in the u.s. we be somewhat isolated geographically in 
      this volatile region they live under the constant reminder of 
      their struggle for freedom and despicable act of century 
      of occupation depopulation repopulation and genocide 
      daily these critical nato ally be expose to putin&#x27;s 
      verbal threat as well as live in the fear of regular cyber 
      and terrorist attack 
        more importantly those in the baltics be watch the 
      reality of russian aggression cruelty and massacre play 
      out in their own backyard today they see the barbaric act of 
      putin bomb a children&#x27;s hospital they see that over 
      ukrainian child have be kidnap and move to 
      russia as part of their history&#x27;s reputation for depopulate 
      those they dominate 
        the leader in this region talk with i because of their 
      close proximity to russia and belarus about their constant 
      fear that they could be annihilate within second and might 
      never see it come they know that putin be ruthless enough 
      and have the thirst for power and land to do it 
        we don&#x27;t see these pressure from our secure vantage point 
      in the u.s. outside of our new threat create by joe 
      biden&#x27;s lackadaisical policy over our own border however 
      these european partner feel a daily struggle to cling to 
      their democracy and freedom 
        each of these vulnerable country be do their part 
      each of they contribute well over percent of their gdp 
      toward their own defense know they&#x27;ll likely have to face 
      another russian invasion of their homeland some day 
      additionally they be contribute to the military and 
      humanitarian need in ukraine 
        but thing become very clear to i on this trip none of 
      they have the size the economy nor the military capability 
      to preserve freedom and democracy on their own their 
      existence be dependent on all of our nato partner 


       only u.s. citizen should have influence on u.s. election 

        the safeguard american voter eligibility save act that i 
      co sponsored and help the house pass protect and preserve 
      the right of american citizen to vote this legislation 
      would require state to obtain proof of citizenship in person 
      when register an individual to vote in federal election 
      and require state to remove non citizen from exist 
      voter roll 
        foreign election interference be make possible because of 
      our lax voter registration law that allow noncitizen to 
      register and vote in federal election with the ongoing 
      crisis at our southern border this piece of legislation be 
      essential to safeguard the integrity of american election 
        the save act will close the loophole that allow noncitizen 
      registration and thereby vote to improve election 
      security minimize the risk of foreign interference and 
      restore americans&#x27 confidence in u.s. election
