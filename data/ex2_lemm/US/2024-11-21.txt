                            of north carolina 

                     in the house of representative 

                       thursday november 

   ms. adams mr. speaker the u.s. census seek to count every 
 american every year they do this so that every american may be 
 equally represent and hear in this chamber by of we friend 
 colleague democrats and republicans i submit this statement 
 tonight because nearly year after our founding the people of 
 north carolina be still not be fairly hear on this floor 
   before the us census count be conduct in north 
 carolina lawmaker who look nothing like i to say the least join 
 with other representative from southern state in advocate that 
 african american slave be count as ` ` fifths&#x27;&#x27 of a resident 
 more resident mean more congressional power so they want our 
 ancestor to count but they deny they the vote they want our 
 body but not our voice 
   the echo of that anti democratic sentiment live today through 
 gerrymandering the effect of it be feel by all north carolina voter 
 and indeed most voter around the country the people of alabama 
 florida illinois maryland ohio texas and florida be not be 
 fairly hear on this floor 
   to this day the practice of gerrymandering drag the foot of our 
 democracy back to the early day of our nation when most of our 
 citizen do not have a voice the new majority be build on it but 
 both party be complicit in it i be stand on this tonight 
 because i won&#x27;t stand for it anymore 
   gerrymandering do more than sand the gear of our democracy it 
 harm our ability to govern we can count people a lot fast than we 
 could in but there&#x27;s a reason the census be only do every 
 year the long stability period give we time to get to know our 
 constituent their need and the need of the land business and 
 organization therein it&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important that these district 
 represent cohesive community but that stability in governance have 
 not be the case for my constituent or for most in north carolina 
   the republican majority in the north carolina general assembly 
 engage in political pornography to stack congressional district in 
 their favor lock of our congressional district into 
 republican control in a state that vote for the us house 
   over the past year of my service this district have undergo 
 change in and now here in my district 
 look something like a potted plant grow along i-85 from charlotte 
 to greensboro if i know then my district would evolve more time 
 i might have trade my house for an rv start in january i&#x27;ll have 
 serve the configuration of my district in year most of you 
 in this chamber who&#x27;ve serve as long as i have have serve just 
 in that same time period 
   think about what serve different district do to our effort 
 at governance every year i give a state of the district speech and 
 i&#x27;m either say goodbye or introduce myself to half my 
 constituent many be surprised to hear from i 
   frequently redrawn district mean weakened and less effective 
 governance constituent need a representative in congress often for 
 basic help with federal service like their social security check 
 unemployment insurance veterans benefit passport service etc 
 constantly scramble relationship between office and constituent 
 hurt this process and hurt our constituent bad it undermine 
 the basic faith americans have in democracy 
   the problem be especially bad in charlotte of the nation&#x27;s 
 fast grow city where many inhabitant relocate from elsewhere 
 and feel especially disengage with local politic as hospitable 
 southerner our state leader should take responsibility for change 
 this unfortunately perpetuate it be more in line with our history 
   state level lawmaker be egg on by their counterpart and former 
 colleague here in washington they think they be here to deliver for 
 a party agenda but let i tell you we be not here to govern for 
 ourselves or for a party we&#x27;re here to govern for the people america 
 have never be about those in power but about the work to make a more 
 perfect union 
   and there be answer 
   while it take nearly year the son and daughter of former 
 slave do eventually realize their right to help choose the 
 representative who walk these hall tonight as the reverend dr. 
 martin luther king jr. once say ` ` the moral arc of the universe be 
 long but it bend toward justice.&#x27;&#x27 
   legal standard for fairly draw district be not rocket science 
 the process work in michigan in pennsylvania and even for a brief 
 time in north carolina national standard would be imperfect but far 
 great than the status quo they would ensure that the 
 americans we count in be divide into equally number 
 fairly and transparently draw more competitive district that be 
 representative of real community they would give we as 
 representative time to get to know our constituent and maybe even 
 solve a few more of their problem too 
   while north carolina republicans have choose party power over the 
 cultivation of democracy cynicism over faith in the people and their 
 newfound fear over whatever once inspire they to public service the 
 people will win in the end 
   democracy will always have the last word
