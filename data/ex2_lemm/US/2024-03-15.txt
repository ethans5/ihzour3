                        wednesday march 

   ms. bonamici mr. speaker i rise today in opposition to h.r. 
 the protecting americans from foreign adversary controlled applications 
 act 
   i agree with my colleague that we must do more to protect personal 
 information online safeguard national security from foreign 
 adversary and protect our electoral system from foreign 
 interference but this bill be far from the comprehensive approach our 
 increasingly connected world need i also have serious concern with 
 the scope of the legislation and open constitutional question about 
 the path forward for its implementation 
   target only foreign adversary control application will not 
 fully protect consumers&#x27 datum in our nation energy amp commerce 
 committee chairwoman mcmorris rodgers and ranking member pallone have 
 already advance bipartisan comprehensive datum privacy legislation 
 and the biden administration have issue an executive order to protect 
 americans&#x27 sensitive personal data instead of address company 
 as the bill we be consider today do we could instead consider 
 that bill or a related proposal that would improve how americans access 
 and control their datum across all app the limited data safeguard in 
 the protecting americans from foreign adversary controlled applications 
 act be not sufficient to justify what could amount to a ban on tiktok 
 in our country 
   civil liberty and legal expert have also raise concern about 
 potential constitutional question regard this bill during his term 
 former president donald trump issue several executive orders that 
 would have have many of the same effect of this bill but court strike 
 down those order additionally the state of montana&#x27;s legislation to 
 ban tiktok and similarly prevent it from access application store 
 be recently put on hold for exceed the authority of the state and 
 potentially violate the amendment i be also concerned that 
 this bill limit legal challenge to just the day after the 
 legislation be enact and restrict challenge to action take under 
 its authority to within day of their implementation these 
 restriction and ongoing constitutional question about limit 
 consumer choice and speech could create significant uncertainty as the 
 bill be implement we should not limit opportunity for americans to 
 protect their right through our legal system 
   the amendment of the u.s. constitution enshrine the protection 
 of free speech and a press free from fear of retribution from the 
 government protect this right be a cornerstone of our democracy 
 and that i be committed to uphold i encourage my colleague to 
 vote against this bill so we can return to the table and negotiate a 
 more comprehensive and effective approach to datum privacy 
   once again i urge my colleague to vote no

                          friday march 

   mr. hunt mr. speaker i rise today to inquire about a possible and 
 deliberate violation of u.s. impose sanction due to russian 
 aggression 
   as the war in ukraine carry on and as russian sanction be 
 impose i worry that our focus on russian asset and agent in europe 
 have overlook asset and agent in former soviet republic such as 
 uzbekistan kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan 
   i would like to draw specific attention to various company 
 register in cyprus which operate in these former soviet republic 
 such example be a cyprus register company which operate in 
 uzbekistan and russia call united cement group ucg 
   ucg acquire the uzbekistan government&#x27;s stake in of the 
 country&#x27;s large cement factory in early in what have be 
 describe as an ` ` opaque&#x27;&#x27 transaction with no formal tender and a 
 significant discount on the sale price this acquisition by ucg have 
 position the company to now control about percent of uzbekistan&#x27;s 
 cement capacity 
   we be see monopolization under the guise of privatization to the 
 benefit of russia 
   this be just example of a bad actor in these relatively 
 overlook country that be take advantage of the international 
 focus on ukraine i will be send a letter to treasury secretary 
 yellen implore she to far investigate these apparently corrupt 
 impropriety and potential sanction violation that continue to 
 transpire in this region of the world
