                                 of texas 

                     in the house of representative 

                      wednesday september 

   ms. jackson lee mr. chair i rise in support of the jackson lee 
 amendment no to h.r. -the department of defense appropriations 
 act 
   i want to thank my colleague on the rules committee for make this 
 amendment in order 
   the jackson lee amendment no be an important and potentially 
 life save amendment in an unfortunate and distract appropriation 
 bill 
   namely the jackson lee amendment no seek to allocate $ 
 to fund triple negative breast cancer research ` ` tnbc&#x27;&#x27 
   i must offer my appreciation to both the military and the biden 
 administration for make research into breast cancer a priority but 
 there be still work to be do 
   breast cancer account for percent of all new annual cancer 
 case worldwide make it the most common cancer in the world 
   this issue be extremely important especially for the brave man and 
 woman in the military who be up to percent more likely to 
 develop breast cancer 
   there be few people in this country whose life have not be 
 touch by breast cancer 
   yet there be persistent disparity in breast cancer incidence and 
 death rate 
   breast cancer be the lead cause of cancer relate death in the 
 united states for black and hispanic woman 
   black woman be more likely to die from breast cancer than woman of 
 any other racial or ethnic group 
   expert believe that it&#x27;s partially because about in black woman 
 be diagnose with triple negative breast cancer more than any other 
 racial or ethnic group 
   compare with non hispanic white woman black woman be less likely 
 to receive guideline adherent care and have an approximate fold 
 high mortality incidence result in a disproportionately high 
 risk of death from triple negative breast cancer 
   triple negative breast cancer ` ` tnbc&#x27;&#x27 be of many form of 
 breast cancer and account for about percent of all diagnose 
 invasive breast cancer case in the united states 
   due to its aggressive behavior tnbc grow quickly and be more likely 
 to have spread at the time it be find and be more likely to come back 
 after treatment than other type of breast cancer 
   tnbc cell do not contain be ` ` negative for&#x27;&#x27 key receptor 
 that medicine typically target in other type of breast cancer 
 therefore there be limited treatment option that can be use to 
 treat the cancer 
   patient with an early diagnosis can often be treat with 
 chemotherapy radiation and surgery however the limited therapy 
 available specifically address the management of tnbc have make 
 treat this disease a challenge for clinician 
   recent innovation in target therapy have fuel advance in the 
 fight against tnbc 
   advance in breast cancer screening and treatment over the last few 
 decade have reduce the overall breast cancer mortality rate yet the 
 disproportionate impact of tnbc on racial and ethnic minority 
 community raise consideration about the underlie determinant 
 drive the disparity 
   it be necessary to promote tnbc education raise awareness about the 
 disease relate disparity and tackle inequity within the health 
 care delivery such as inadequate access to screening diagnostic 
 testing and care to improve early detection and survival 
   the jackson lee amendment no would allow for more research so we 
 can day hopefully learn a way to reduce the number of military 
 personnel affect by breast cancer 
   we all know by the way that breast cancer can affect both man and 
 woman 
   the bad news be breast cancer have be just about as brutal on woman 
 in the military as combat 
   let i say that sentence again breast cancer have be just about as 
 brutal on woman in the military as combat 
   more than woman have be wound in iraq and afghanistan 
 accord to the army times military woman be diagnose with 
 breast cancer just between and and accord to that same 
 study more be suspect it grow 
   the good news be that we have be work on it and i want to add 
 my appreciation to the military this amendment however will allow 
 for the additional research need 
   as new young woman come into the united states military as woman 
 stay long in the united states military as woman get old in the 
 united states military as woman ascend to leadership role in the 
 united states military these dollar provide research 
   not only be breast cancer strike relatively young military woman at 
 an alarming rate but male service member veteran and their 
 dependent be at risk as well 
   with a young and generally healthy population those in the 
 military tend to have a low risk for most cancer than civilians-- 
 include significantly low colorectal lung and cervical but breast 
 cancer be a different story 
   military people in general and in some case very specifically be 
 at a significantly great risk for contract breast cancer say dr. 
 richard clapp a top cancer expert at boston university who work at 
 the centers for disease control and prevention on military breast 
 cancer issue he say life in the military can mean exposure to a 
 witch&#x27;s brew of risk factor directly link to great chance of 
 get breast cancer 
   so my friend i be ask that we do the right thing 
   we be on the right track we be on the right rail we be on the 
 right road 
    but with the expansion of woman in the military i can assure you 
 for long life a vital service that these man and woman give it be 
 extremely important to move forward with this amendment 
   researcher have point to a high use of oral contraception in the 
 military than in the general population and oral contraception have 
 long be link to breast cancer among woman an alarming factor that 
 would ensure that this particular amendment would be a positive step 
 forward 
   despite significant advancement in prevention diagnosis and 
 treatment more progress can and must be make not only to reduce the 
 fatality rate of breast cancer but also to research method of 
 prevention and way to drastically reduce risk factor 
   to this end i have over the year be successful in win passage 
 of several jackson lee amendments to the national defense 
 appropriations act in prior year to improve breast cancer research 
 across the united states 
   i be here today seek support for the same amendment to provide 
 increase funding for the defense health program&#x27;s research and 
 development by $ these fund would specifically address the 
 issue of breast cancer in the united states military 
   several initiative i have design in the past have aid active- 
 duty servicemen and woman along with veteran such as enforce 
 accurate reporting of maternity mortality rate among the armed forces 
 address physical and mental health concern and secure 
 authorization for post traumatic stress disorder as well as triple 
 negative breast cancer research funding 
   additionally i have introduce h.r. bo the triple negative breast 
 cancer research and education act of which focus on expand 
 intensifying and coordinate program for the conduct and support of 
 research on triplenegative breast cancer a type of breast cancer that 
 be difficult to detect but disproportionately impact african american 
 and hispanic woman 
   i be very proud of the work that i and congress have do to address 
 the health concern of active duty and veteran servicemen and woman 
 but there be still improvement to be make 
   as a breast cancer survivor myself i understand the toll which this 
 destructive disease take on patient and their family member 
   support and encouragement be invaluable resource to those battle 

 page e908 

 cancer and spread awareness of of the most pressing health 
 concern can help minimize the burden on those currently fight 
   the man and woman who be on the front line or have already 
 complete their valiant service to this country have many press 
 issue and challenge they already must face breast cancer should not 
 be of they 
   our service member fight and sacrifice for our freedom 
   now as lawmaker we should be work to ensure to protect their 
 life and freedom not try to take their right away 
   while the negative of this defense appropriation bill 
 disappointedly outweigh my positive amendment i urge my colleague to 
 vote in favor of the jackson lee amendment no -notwithstanding my 
 strong opposition and encouragement to vote down the underlie bill

                       thursday september 

   mr. beyer mr. speaker i rise today to recognize suicide prevention 
 month we know our country be in the midst of a severe mental health 
 crisis and people be struggle after decline in the suicide rate 
 from to the rate increase almost percent in 
 provisional datum from the cdc show that the rate be continue to 
 rise up percent from to accord to this datum which 
 be not yet final we lose about people to suicide in 
   this be a dire situation but we have tool to help save life and 
 the opportunity to transform how we as a nation respond to suicide 
 mental health and substance use crisis i be grateful to my colleague 
 for support the suicide amp crisis lifeline formerly the national 
 suicide prevention lifeline the lifeline have help connect 
 million of individual across the country with support and resource 
 in their darkest hour since its transition to the dialing code 
 from the long digit hotline in july of the lifeline have 
 receive almost contact through call chat and text 
 vibrant emotional health the administrator of the lifeline estimate 
 that this number could reach in the next fiscal year fy24 
   we must ensure that anyone in crisis regardless of the time of day 
 or where they be have someone to talk to someone to respond and a 
 safe place to go continued federal investment be critical for the 
 lifeline to sustain the crisis care continuum and build out the call 
 center as well as mobile crisis response team and crisis 
 stabilization facility 
   suicide do not discriminate and impact all community with some 
 population be at increase risk for example between and 
 increase in age adjust suicide rate be high amongst 
 native americans percent with blacks percent and hispanics 
 percent also experience significant increase other 
 disproportionately impact population include veterans people live 
 in rural area lgbtq people middle aged and old adult tribal 
 population and youth 
   vibrant estimate that about percent of chat and text contact be 
 initiate by youth and young adult we must meet child and 
 adolescent where they be and ensure that chat and text capacity be 
 strong enough to meet this great demand to address mental health 
 challenge among our youth i will be reintroduce the peer to peer 
 suicide prevention act which would help young people support their 
 mental health byestablishe a competitive grant program for middle and 
 high school to facilitate student lead suicide prevention program 
   a study from pew charitable trusts early this year reveal that 
 only about percent of adult in the us be aware of the suicide 
 amp crisis lifeline the lifeline represent a chance to change how 
 our country support those in crisis it can not reach its potential if 
 most people be unaware of its existence and of its numerous resource 
 and support it can offer they when they need they most a coordinated 
 national suicide prevention public awareness campaign be necessary to 
 educate people across the country of what have to offer that&#x27;s why
