                     in the house of representative 

                         tuesday april 

   ms. hoyle of oregon mr. speaker i will vote in support of h. res 
 a non binding resolution that condemn the use of a slogan that 
 have be use by some individual and group for antisemitic purpose 
 include as a rallying cry to deny the right to self determination of 
 the jewish people or even to eliminate the state of israel from the 
 jordan river to the mediterranean sea 
   i believe the antisemitic use of this slogan should rightfully be 
 condemn for example this slogan have be widely use by terrorist 
 entity include hamas the palestinian islamic jihad and 
 hezbollah to encourage future attack on israel the jewish community 
 and jewish institution with antisemitism and antisemitic attack on 
 the rise in the u.s. and around the world we must swiftly condemn 
 antisemitism in all its form 
   however this resolution should have be write well for 
 example h. res fail to acknowledge that some who use the phrase 
 do so to advocate for palestinian liberation and equality and others-- 
 include some member of the jewish community use the phrase to 
 advocate for an end to the israeli control and annexation of the west 
 bank and gaza the resolution should have note that this slogan be not 
 always intend to be use as antisemitic and not all who use the 
 phrase be antisemitic 
   as with other resolution this congress h. res also fail to 
 condemn antisemitic act from those on the far right include white 
 nationalist who have increasingly promote antisemitic conspiracy 
 theory and have threaten the life and livelihood of jewish 
 americans 
   h. res also treat the slogan ` ` from the river to the sea&#x27;&#x27 as 
 sided however this phrase have also be use by right wing 
 israelis include by prime minister netanyahu himself in january to 
 deny the right to self determination of the palestinian people 
   let i be clear i believe that both israelis and palestinians have a 
 right to their own state that&#x27;s why i strongly support a state 
 solution where israelis and palestinians recognize each other&#x27;s right 
 to live in peace and have prosperity 
   i also unequivocally condemn all form of antisemitism and i be 
 appal by the significant rise in antisemitism we&#x27;ve see in recent 
 year and especially after hamas&#x27;s october terrorist attack on 
 israel if the house republican majority be serious about tackle 
 antisemitism they would support president biden&#x27;s national strategy to 
 counter antisemitism would quit try to defund the office of civil 
 rights for title vi enforcement which protect jewish student and 
 would increase funding for the high risk nonprofit grant program to 
 secure jewish institution as a start i urge house republicans to 
 prioritize real action to combat hate rather than continue to waste 
 time and resource on non binding resolution 
   that&#x27;s why i&#x27;ve cosponsor legislation that thoughtfully and 
 powerfully condemn the rise of antisemitism in the united states and 
 call on congress to support the above substantive action to tackle 
 antisemitism which congressional republicans have so far refuse to 
 do
