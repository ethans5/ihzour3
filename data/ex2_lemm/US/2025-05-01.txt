                          thursday may 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker house republicans just waste another week 
 in washington with no legislation to show for it that would address our 
 shrink economy or rise cost of living 
   instead they launch a series of attack on a national park an 
 endanger specie and the ability of state to set strong standard 
 to protect the air that we breathe 
   h.j. res would prevent the national park service from regulate 
 motor vehicle use in the glen canyon national recreation area where 
 just percent of the road have safeguard put in place to restrict the 
 damage that off road vehicle have cause this be a narrowly focused 
 rule to target protection in sensitive area for the cultural site 
 native wildlife and other natural resource that the park contain 
   h.j. res h.j. res and h.j. res all attempt to misuse the 
 congressional review act cra process to overturn decision at the 
 environmental protection agency epa to reduce air pollution under 
 the clean air act caa california can apply for waiver to set its 
 own vehicle emission standard and other state can adopt 
 california&#x27;s exact regulation under certain circumstance the law 
 explicitly grant these state the ability to protect their citizen 
 from air pollution and address climate change with strong standard 
 and in do so they be save americans $ in fuel cost 
 through 
   these republican resolution would make the air dirty raise cost 
 for driver and also violate the law the government accountability 
 office gao and the senate parliamentarian have already make it clear 
 that caa waiver do not qualify as a target for a cra these decision 
 be not rule subject to review but house republicans be ignore the 
 law to try to set a precedent for drastically expand what other 
 protection for the american people they can undermine with a cra 
   as if all this wasn&#x27;t enough republicans wrap up the week with an 
 attack on an endangered specie of smelt in the san francisco bay- 
 delta delist a fish won&#x27;t solve the water shortage problem of the 
 west it be a distraction from the real issue of climate change 
 outdated infrastructure and compete water allocation furthermore 
 this smelt be a critical part of the foodweb in an ecosystem on the 
 verge of collapse h.j. res would not only overturn the current 
 listing of the longfin smell but prevent it from ever be list in 
 the future no matter how much the threat to this specie and its 
 estuary increase 
   i vote against all of the congressional review act resolution 
 that be bring to the floor this week and i urge the republican 
 house majority to stop bring these harmful and nonsensical attack 
 on our public health and the environment to the house floor strip 
 away protection for our wildlife for our national park and for the 
 very air in our lung doesn&#x27;t improve americans life
