 forest service&#x27;s forest legacy program current law require that only 
 the federal or state government can hold conservation easement 
 purchase under the forest legacy program 
   allow state participate in the federal forest legacy program 
 the flexibility to partner with accredit nonprofit land trust will 
 help permanently conserve more land by work with private landowner

 hold all accredit nonprofit land trust participate in the 
 program to the high possible standard in addition it implement 
 safeguard to prevent misuse of the program and allow the u.s. forest

 conveniently release he month after ballot have be cast dr. 
 chowdhury be not alone in his politically motivated imprisonment his 
 be of nearly arrest of bnp leader and political 
 dissident but despite the government&#x27;s sinister ploy to subvert the 
 electoral process dr. chowdhury and the other jail bangladeshi 
 dissident be vindicate and their cause ultimately prevail after 
 a historic youth lead movement to end prime minister hasina&#x27;s despotic 
 reign the bangladeshi people have earn the right to redirect their 
 future it&#x27;s now time for the international community to support the 
 fundamental principle of democratic governance in bangladesh 
   meantime in hong kong the chinese communist party ccp continue to 
 erode the city&#x27;s political independence in july a hong kong court 
 take over by the ccp deny a request to resume the trial of pro- 
 democracy activist jimmy lai the case prosecute mr. lai for what be 
 essentially a ` ` thought crime&#x27;&#x27 lay bare the ccp&#x27;s authoritarian 
 takeover of the once free hong kong i be proud to adopt jimmy lai as 
 a prisoner of conscience through the tom lantos human rights 
 commission&#x27;s defend freedoms project and will continue to 
 passionately advocate for his release 
   jimmy lai be not the only prisoner of conscience detain by an 
 autocratic regime in july i write a letter to president biden and 
 secretary blinken urge the administration to demand the release of 
 those wrongfully imprison in saudi arabia for exercise their basic 
 human right thousand of courageous activist journalist religious 
 cleric and human right defender have be silence for simply 
 speak out about their dream for democracy such as their desire to 
 move freely speak openly and wear whatever they choose in response to 
 their impassioned advocacy the repressive saudi arabian regime have 
 unjustly imprison critical voice issue violent threat and 
 impose severe travel ban this draconian reign of terror must end 
 immediately 
   the government of bahrain turkey belarus and numerous other 
 nation be also hold prisoner of conscience hostage to suppress 
 the voice of their fellow citizen our foreign policy must not 
 overlook these human right violation be it governments&#x27 subversion 
 of electoral process obstruction of justice or the crushing of 
 dissent i invite my colleague to use their various platform to 
 support prisoner of conscience everywhere to tell their story in the 
 pursuit of justice join the defending freedoms project be 
 excellent avenue to do so 
   in alexis de tocqueville write that democracy and voting right 
 could shrink and shrivel away or grow and expand today our world be 
 embroil in a period of democratic backsliding in reverence to the 
 international day of democracy i&#x27;m ask each of my colleague to 
 join i in boldly advocate for democracy and freedom across the 
 world
