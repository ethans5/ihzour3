                               of minnesota 

                     in the house of representative 

                       wednesday november 

   ms. omar mr. speaker i rise today to address the increase threat 
 of nuclear weapon last year the united states spend $ on 
 nuclear weapon imagine if we use even a fraction of that to tackle 
 homelessness fund healthcare or address the climate crisis instead 
 we&#x27;re pour billion into weapon that could wipe out entire city 
 in second 
   the simple truth be as long as nuclear weapon exist humanity be at 
 risk miscalculation malfunction act of aggression and 
 we&#x27;re look at a disaster that could end civilization as we know it 
 keep these weapon isn&#x27;t about strength or security it&#x27;s about 
 hold on to outdated cold war fear 
   the only sane position be the complete abolition of these weapon of 
 mass destruction from the face of the planet but this will only happen 
 with bold leadership from the united states 
   as tension rise with adversary like russia and china and concern 
 grow about nuclear proliferation in volatile region like the middle 
 east the threat of nuclear war be more urgent than it have be since 
 the cuban missile crisis 
   that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m grateful to my colleague congressman jim mcgovern 
 for his tireless work in draw attention to this critical issue he 
 understand that we have a moral imperative to act 
   it&#x27;s time for the united states to join the treaty on the prohibition 
 of nuclear weapons and take a real stand for disarmament maintain 
 an arsenal of world end weapon be not a sign of strength it be a 
 terrifying vulnerability 
   the american people deserve leader who will prioritize human life 
 over outdated cold war posturing we have the chance to make the world 
 a safe place redirect resource to press domestic need and 
 fulfill our obligation to future generation 
   the time for action have never be more pressing
