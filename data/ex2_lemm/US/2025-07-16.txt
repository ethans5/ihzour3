                          monday july 

   ms. lofgren mr. speaker i rise today in opposition to h.r. 
 the ntia policy and cybersecurity coordination act 
   the national telecommunications and information administration or 
 ntia be a critical agency within the department of commerce that work 
 across the federal government to develop telecommunication and 
 information policy congress should support this agency and give it the 
 resource and authority it need to fulfill its current mission 
 however this bill would waste taxpayer dollar by unnecessarily 
 duplicate activity already authorize by congress 
   the ntia be originally part of its sister agency the national 
 institute of standards and technology since congress establish ntia 
 as its own agency in the agency have carry out 
 complementary but distinct area of work nist serve as an 
 independent unbiased arbiter of trusted measurement and standard 
 while ntia have its regulatory responsibility 
   these agency often work together unfortunately this bill would 
 swell ntia&#x27;s mission into a cybersecurity role to which it do not 
 possess the appropriate experience or expertise and blur the line 
 between the agency especially on issue relate to cybersecurity 
 for example congress authorize nist in collaboration with cisa to 
 conduct a cybersecurity activity relate to the internet and 
 communication network in the cybersecurity enhancements act of 
 the chips and science act of the hacked act of and more 
 h.r. would directly duplicate at ntia those ongoing effort 
 underway at nist there be also a provision in the bill that implicate 
 agency outside of the department of commerce by duplicate the 
 department of homeland security&#x27;s information technology supply chain 
 security program 
   this act be include as part of a broad ntia reauthorization that 
 be consider in 

 page e681 

 the congress at the time the department of commerce weigh in 
 request significant change to the provision that be unfortunately 
 not include in the act we will consider today as such this bill 
 merit far vetting and input from the department of commerce 
   this bill need to be change to address these concern until that 
 happen i must regretfully oppose this legislation in its current form
