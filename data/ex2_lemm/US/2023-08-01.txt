                         tuesday august 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the national capital 
 planning commission district of columbia home rule act this bill would 
 remove the authority of the national capital planning commission 
 ncpc a federal agency to review or approve the development of 
 district of columbia own real property this bill would also remove 
 the requirement that the d.c. mayor get ncpc&#x27;s approval before sell 
 d.c.-owne real property and allow d.c. agency to transfer 
 jurisdiction over d.c.-owned real property among themselves without 
 ncpc&#x27;s approval 
   under federal law ncpc have approval authority for the development of 
 d.c.-owne building locate in the ` ` central area,&#x27;&#x27 include the 
 location height bulk number of story and size of such building 
 d.c. be require to consult with ncpc on d.c.-owned building outside 
 the central area but ncpc have only advisory authority in those area 
 the central area be define by the concurrent action of ncpc and the 
 d.c. council and currently consist of the downtown and shaw urban 
 renewal area 
   ncpc&#x27;s authority over d.c.-owne real property be unnecessary as 
 demonstrate by the virtual absence of its use to disapprove sale or 
 development and violate d.c. home rule the federal government should 
 not be able to slow or block the development of d.c.-owned real 
 property or add to the cost of development 
   this bill be an important step to increase home rule for d.c. i urge 
 my colleague to support this bill
