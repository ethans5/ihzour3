                        tuesday december 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 special elections home rule act this bill would give the district of 
 columbia complete authority to set the date of special election for 
 local office like other jurisdiction this bill would remove a 
 limitation in the d.c. home rule act that be not only inconsistent with 
 the self government grant by the home rule act but be also harmful 
   in i get legislation enact that give the d.c. board of 
 elections board more flexibility to set the date of special election 
 for local office although i seek complete authority for d.c. to set 
 the date of special election the law do not include this home- 
 rule principle 
   the home rule act originally require the board to hold special 
 election on the tuesday occur more than day after a 
 vacancy and allow the board to schedule special election on the same 
 day as the next general election if that election occur within 
 day from when a special election would otherwise have be hold this 
 inflexibility lead to special election be hold on religious holiday 
 and force d.c. to hold a special election separate from an upcoming 
 general election cost d.c. hundred of thousand of dollar the 
 law require the board to hold a special election on a tuesday 
 occur between and day after a vacancy 
   this bill be an important step to perfect home rule for d.c. i urge 
 my colleague to support this bill
