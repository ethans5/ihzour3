 of boston journalism and of the most trust name in the business 
 he get his start at whdh before move to fox -eventually landing at 
 wcvb in but the value he&#x27;s carry from newsroom to newsroom 
 haven&#x27;t change fairness transparency accountability and truth 
   for the past year mike have be a force of nature at wcvb 
 produce newscenter and the sunday morning political program on the 
 record it&#x27;s the most watch political talk show in new england and 
 for good reason it&#x27;s thoughtful fair and tough and mike be of 
 the main reason why chase down story book guest double-

 more than just the ability of a journalist to write or say whatever 
 they want it&#x27;s about our ability as a society to make decision 
 base on the fact put in context and deliver fairly and

   mr. davis of illinois mr. speaker as a policymaker and citizen i 
 unconditionally and absolutely reject president trump&#x27;s and elon musk&#x27;s 
 work to steal american&#x27;s social security benefit a scheme that hurt 
 middle class and working class family and senior to pay for tax 
 handout to billionaire when americans already face increase price 
 and economic hardship from the president&#x27;s chaotic policy mr. trump 
 threaten social security the lead assistance program that 
 americans depend on for monthly assistance this group include 
 the more than senior age or old for whom percent of 
 their income be their earn social security benefit without social 
 security percent of old woman would live in poverty about 
 percent of black senior percent of latino senior and percent 
 of asian american senior rely mostly or only on social security for 
 income this effort to gut social security be an appalling illustration 
 of the high level of greed where billionaire rob from hard work 
 americans to augment their wealth 
   by slash staff close out of regional office cut 
 customer service operation restrict phone service assistance and 
 spread falsehood about the social security administration ssa 
 trump and musk jeopardize americans&#x27 earn benefit and security let 
 i be clear cut to the social security administration that prevent 
 beneficiary from access their benefit be absolutely 
 unequivocally backdoor benefit cut senior and people with 
 disability can not get help by phone due to reduce phone service 
 they can&#x27;t get help by the website that frequently crash and present 
 access barrier to the elderly nor can they get help in person give 
 the increase distance to office and long wait time due to dramatic 
 staff cut and office closure 
   at the time when the great number of baby boomer be retire and 
 need the most help and when ssa already be at its low staffing level 
 in decade it be unconscionable that the republicans seek to gut 
 social security and throw senior orphan and those with disability 
 into poverty all baby boomer will be by so we be in the 
 peak period of retirement i introduce the keep our field offices 
 open act as an essential step to protect social security benefit 
 for the in americans who need these community office field

 give the in person assistance to ensure they receive their correct 
 benefit in my congressional district alone retired worker 
 disabled worker and widower or parent receive critical 
 social security benefit an additional receive supplemental 
 security income to pay their bill and survive these constituent rely 
 on field office when they need help field office be not extra or 
 fluff they be crucial 
   i also must refuse the default republican social security ` ` reform&#x27;&#x27 
 of raise the retirement age to give that it would 
 disproportionately harm black man and community of color who have 
 low life expectance systematic inequality in socioeconomic 
 status education food security and access to healthcare play an 
 intricate role in life expectancy the life expectancy for black man be 
 age in contrast to for white man all americans should 
 equitably reap the earn benefit of their tireless labor 
   with few than day in office president trump have already 
 cause tremendous harm to social security jeopardize the well being 
 of ten of million of senior veteran and people with disability 
 this assault on social security be an assault on our nation&#x27;s most 
 vulnerable and least secure across the nation this damage be in 
 addition to his erratic 

 page e332 

 and senseless tariff and the dramatic reduction or elimination of 
 essential support for housing healthcare food and education and so 
 much more these policy threaten the livelihood of individual and 
 our nation&#x27;s economy all so the obscenely wealthy grow more secure 
 while condemn the majority to a precarious existence defenseless 
 against life&#x27;s unpredictability and wholly susceptible to exploitation 
 and despair i will fight with every ounce of my be to oppose 
 president trump&#x27;s and elon musk&#x27;s theft of social security and the 
 republican effort to cripple americans for their greed
