 its timely execution condition on the usmma&#x27;s kings point new york

 need to fulfill their mission it be now time to make the institution 
 worthy of their commitment to serve our nation 

                 maritime security infrastructure council 

            u.s. merchant marine academy full speed ahead plan 


  full speed ahead a plan to address critical infrastructure need at 
                     the u.s. merchant marine academy 

        background in january the maritime security 
      infrastructure council msic a group with expertise in 
      major construction project management and concerned about the 
      deterioration of the u.s. merchant marine academy usmma 
      infrastructure develop a comprehensive plan to bring the 
      campus up to the standard necessary to prepare usmma 
      midshipmen to lead our nation&#x27;s maritime mission in the 
      century 
        the full speed ahead plan be an intensive year program to 
      execute a decade overdue comprehensive modernization new 
      academic building physical readiness training facility 
      midshipman morale and welfare space parking structure 
      faculty and senior staff housing utility it and campus 
      security upgrade and renovation of many exist 
      building this plan be adaptable e.g. it can be adjust 
      for long construction timeline and funding schedule 
      and importantly it be intend to be execute while keep 
      usmma fully operational throughout construction 
        previous cost estimate be $ m in january and 
      $ m in march the estimate cost when adjust for 
      inflation have now rise to $ 1.02b additional delay will only 
      far increase the cost of this urgently need 
      modernization 
        the need with over year in service to our nation a 
      comprehensive modernization be long overdue if usmma be to 
      continue produce world class service commit merchant 
      marine officer who be the backbone of the u.s. navy&#x27;s 
      strategic sealift officer force and a crucial element of 
      defense readiness 
        congress have rightly recognize the necessity of and 
      support funding modernization project at the other federal 
      service academy especially west point and annapolis long- 
      term low funding level have leave the campus under resource 
      and the result be a deteriorate campus that make 
      attract a diverse applicant pool and provide state of- 
      the art mission critical training even more difficult many 
      of the facility date back to the academy&#x27;s found in the 
      1940 and be simply not conducive to the immersive training 
      and demand coursework expect from our nation&#x27;s 
      service academy 
        modern it be nearly nonexistent in several building what 
      be available can not accommodate even the most basic digital 
      need of midshipmen let alone support the increasingly high- 
      tech vessel system that they must master 
        aside from minor midshipmen barracks repair in the 2000 
      there have be no renovation or upgrade since nearly 
      every building on campus have exceed its life expectancy and 
      now require replacement or major renovation 
        this be particularly true of the academy&#x27;s physical 
      training leadership readiness and athletic facility 
      although usmma be the federal service academy to admit 
      woman in no additional athletic or training space have 
      be provide for female team in the ensue year 
      clearly contrary to the requirement of title ix overall 
      these limited and outdated facility be inadequate for 
      midshipmen to maintain physical readiness standard of the 
      u.s. navy and other service and adversely impact the 
      recruitment of future midshipmen midshipmen need a purpose- 
      build pool feature a separate wave pool with high dive/ 
      jump capability in order to accommodate their specific 
      mandatory training need for rescue and survival at sea 
        the fix our working group of maritime executive 
      engineer architect and construction industry 
      professional some usmma graduate propose the 
      authorization and funding of a multi year program of 
      infrastructure replacement and improvement project 
        the budget and timeline snapshot we suggest direct 
      funding for foundational design work that will serve as the 
      blueprint for an aggressive year construction and 
      project management program however the plan can be readily 
      adapt to meet long construction timeline and funding 
      schedule along with any potential project modification as 
      of january the current cost of the plan be $ 1.02b over 
      year 
        the plan for decade concerned stakeholder have 
      unsuccessfully seek to upgrade usmma&#x27;s physical plant this 
      plan reflect much of the quality thinking and hard work that 
      go into early plan which regrettably never come to 
      fruition this document specifically build on the input of 
      those early planning initiative 
        this plan detail the facility necessary for the usmma to 
      preserve its position as the preeminent leader in maritime 
      education in the nation today and into the future it 
      reflect a long overdue acknowledgment that the campus have
