   ms. norton mr. speaker i rise to introduce a bill that would expand 
 the mission of the national park service nps to include active use of 
 national park system unit locate in urban area the idea for this 
 bill come from a new report author by george washington university&#x27;s 
 sumner m. redstone global center for prevention and wellness that 
 examine strategy to create a more equitable and activate park 
 system in the district of columbia 
   as the report note nps park in d.c. be ` ` inconsistently manage 
 and inequitably maintained&#x27;&#x27 and ` ` do not meet the need of people who 
 both live near and experience the park system as a part of their daily 
 lives.&#x27;&#x27 effort to activate and improve local park have be hinder 
 by limitation on nps&#x27;s statutory authority nps&#x27;s primary mission be 
 to preserve space for the enjoyment of future generation this noble 
 mission be craft for the purpose of wilderness preservation 
 allow nature to remain untouched by time however in addition to 
 grand national park nps also own neighborhood park in urban area 
 for example more than percent of d.c. land consist of parkland 
 and nps own nearly percent of it over third of which be 
 local neighborhood park small than acre these park could 
 benefit from improvement that prioritize community engagement 
 include trail playground and bench however nps&#x27;s mission be 
 limit to preserve land as it currently exist this mission be ill- 
 suit to address the unique and immediate need of urban neighborhood 
 park 
   this bill would expand the mission of nps to include the promotion of 
 active use of its park locate in urban area active use prioritize 
 current enjoyment by people and improve quality of life include 
 playground pedestrian- and bicycle friendly infrastructure sport 
 and recreation facility community event programming and 
 concession this expand mission would only apply to park locate in 
 area that have be define and designate as ` ` urban&#x27;&#x27 in the most 
 recent decennial census by the secretary of commerce and would not 
 impact wilderness area 
   i strongly urge my colleague to support this bill

 close a loophole and ensure that defense contractor provide the 
 federal government cost or price information in all case where there 
 isn&#x27;t adequate price competition that result in at least competitive 
 bid the bill would restore market dynamic and ensure that

 for progress payment which will help to tie payment to performance 
 by provide contractor the opportunity to receive advance payment 
 only when they meet certain condition such as provide timely 
 response disclose important datum and meet small business

   ms. stevens mr. speaker i want to take this opportunity to look 
 back on gun violence prevention month during this time of mourning and 
 remembrance i have have near constant nightmarish image in mind 
 image of human carnage in the aftermath of shooting involve 
 military style assault weapon like the one we now witness on a 
 regular predictable basis 
   family be unable to simply run errand on the weekend or interact 
 with their neighbor without fear of lose their life 
   and yet most of my colleague on the other side of the aisle 
 tolerate this uniquely american carnage without hesitation 
   we know that the assault weapons ban be effective at reduce 
 crime and get these military style weapon off our street 
   and we know that after the ban be drop between and 
 mass shooting where an assault weapon be use account for a 
 of all mass shoot death and more than percent of all injury 
   ar-15s and other assault weapon be the tool of choice by gunman in 
 nearly all of the deadly mass shooting since include the 
 gunman in uvalde texas who shoot and kill child and teacher 
 in their elementary school 
   this be a crisis of law and order we must return safety to our 
 street 
   gun violence leave a mark on each individual and community it 
 impact and it spar none of our constituent it also spar none of 
 our mind these day as we await news of the next atrocity 
   may we find the political courage to do well for you for our brave 
 responder and law enforcement officer for our kid for our 
 devastate community across this nation 
   by use our power as legislator we can create a safe society 
 where individual can exercise their right responsibly while also 
 curb the senseless loss of innocent life it&#x27;s time to prioritize 
 human life over political division and enact the change that our 
 community so desperately need

                          thursday july 

   mr. stevens mr. speaker last month i join my equality caucus 
 colleague in recognize pride month an opportunity to honor the 
 lgbtq+ community celebrate the development we have make and 
 acknowledge the work that have yet to be do 
   we have make remarkable progress towards full equality since lgbtq+ 
 patron fight back against discrimination and police harassment at the 
 stonewall inn in june of 
   acceptance of this community have reach important height marriage 
 equality be the law of the land and the supreme court have make clear 
 that worker can not be fire because of their sexual orientation or 
 gender identity 
   since enter congress i have have the distinct privilege of voting 
 to pass the equality act to prohibit discrimination the no hate act to 
 respond to hate crime the global respect act to deny visa to those 
 who commit human right abuse against lgbtq+ folk and much more 
   as a lifelong friend of the lgbtq+ community and a member of congress 
 commit to the pursuit of global tolerance i know we still have so 
 much work to do 
   hundred of anti lgbtq+ bill have be introduce in the state in 
 recent legislative session and many have be sign into law many 
 of these law target young people and especially trans and nonbinary 
 youth 
   furthermore i have be disgust and infuriate by comment that i 
 have hear from some of my colleague across the aisle on the house 
 education and workforce committee during recent activity those who 
 wish to delegitimize the gender identity of our youth and strip 
 lgbtq+ student of their right resource and humanity 
   our kid be suffer and i will not stand for it 
   to everyone in this beautiful community know that i see you i love 
 you and we have a big circle over here on capitol hill that will never 
 let intolerance even and especially in the high level of 
 government go unchallenged 
   too many of our lgbtq+ family friend coworker and love one 
 face discrimination every day all across the nation continue to 
 pass pro equality legislation send a powerful message to member of 
 the lgbtq+ community that they be not class citizen 
   every human deserve to live as their most authentic self and every 
 american require equal treatment under the law 
   you deserve to feel safe when on public transportation in the 
 workplace in the doctor&#x27;s office and in the classroom no exception 
   go forward from this year&#x27;s pride month i will continue the fight 
 to ensure that lgbtq+ americans be safe secure and free from 
 discrimination
