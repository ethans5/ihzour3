      investment in community with additional hardship such as 
      brownfield and superfund site 
        to address this overlook issue i introduce the 
      bipartisan economic opportunity for distressed communities 
      act to designate all superfund and brownfield area as 
      opportunity zones and to encourage the clean up 
      redevelopment and revitalization of these contaminate 
      site 
        if clean brownfield and superfund site can be 
      redevelop into new housing or business space and promote 
      cleanup and development of these site will create job 
      business opportunity and increase property value in 
      western north carolina and nationwide 
        support small business in the aftermath of disaster 
        the destruction leave by hurricane helene have force many 
      western north carolinians to depend on federal resource to 
      rebuild their home and business 
        obstacle that stand in the way of recovery be a 
      current law that restrict hurricane survivor from double- 
      dipping in the disaster aid system by prohibit folk from 
      receive a ` ` duplication of benefits.&#x27;&#x27 
        unfortunately wrap up in this law be limitation from 
      access federal loan and federal grant for the same 
      disaster that mean if a business owner receive a federal 
      disaster recovery loan from the small business 
      administration they be ineligible to receive a federal 
      recovery grant from the $ community development 
      block grant disaster recovery funding that i author and 
      secure in the american relief act 
        even though sba loan be require to be repay and cdbg dr 
      grant be time payment to victim that do not require 
      repayment the federal government view the as a 
      ` ` duplication of benefits.&#x27;&#x27 
        that&#x27;s why i introduce the helene small business recovery 
      act which would temporarily waive loan from be 
      consider as a duplication of benefit for disaster 
      occur in calendar year or this clarification 
      would provide an exemption to the duplication of benefit 
      issue for all wnc business that receive an sba loan from 
      hurricane helene 
        hurricane helene cause nearly $ in damage in 
      wnc&#x27;s mountain and the state of north carolina estimate at 
      least $ of the damage be to the economy and 
      housing with damage far exceed currently available 
      resource our community must be able to access every 
      possible dollar appropriate for helene recovery 
        congress must pass this bill so that disaster survivor be 
      not restrict from access critical federal aid need to 
      sustain our region&#x27;s business and keep our family in our 
      mountain
