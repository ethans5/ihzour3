   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the national capital 
 planning commission district of columbia home rule act this bill would 
 remove the authority of the national capital planning commission 
 ncpc a federal agency to review or approve the development of 
 district of columbia own real property this bill would also remove 
 the requirement that the d.c. mayor get ncpc&#x27;s approval before sell 
 d.c.-owne real property and allow d.c. agency to transfer 
 jurisdiction over d.c.-owned real property among themselves without 
 ncpc&#x27;s approval 
   under federal law ncpc have approval authority for the development of 
 d.c.-owne building locate in the ` ` central area,&#x27;&#x27 include the 
 location height bulk number of story and size of such building 
 d.c. be require to consult with ncpc on the development of d.c.-owned 
 building outside the central area but ncpc have only advisory 
 authority in those area the central area be define by the concurrent 
 action of ncpc and the d.c. council and currently consist of the 
 downtown and shaw urban renewal areas 
   ncpc&#x27;s authority over d.c.-owne real property violate d.c. home 
 rule and be unnecessary as demonstrate by the virtual absence of its 
 use to disapprove sale or development the federal government should 
 not be able to slow block or add to the cost of the development of 
 d.c.-owne real property 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill

                          tuesday june 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker impeachment be the most consequential tool 
 congress have for uphold our duty to defend the constitution and 
 protect the american people from a president who have betray his oath 
 and engage in illegal conduct 
   bring an impeachment resolution to the floor in the manner it be 
 do by congressman green undermine the ability of congress to make 
 the serious and very real case for impeachment against this or any 
 future president impeachment necessitate a deliberate process of 
 investigation and thorough documentation of crime commit against 
 the american people 
   president trump be impeach twice during his term because he 
 prove himself to be unfit to serve in office and i vote to impeach 
 he both time before bring those resolution to the floor the 
 democratic majority in the house commit ourselves to build the 
 case as a prosecutor do for a trial we conduct a formal inquiry 
 during the impeachment where we subpoena witness and hold 
 public hearing we produce the evidence to demonstrate that the 
 president have abuse his power and obstruct congress 
   when president trump be impeach a time for incite an 
 insurrection the democratic conference work together to draft a 
 factual and thoughtful impeachment resolution to reflect what member 
 of congress and our entire nation witness on january when 
 the resolution be bring to the floor a week later almost every 
 house democrat be a cosponsor i preside over that vote in the house 
 of representatives with full confidence in the case we be present 
 to the american people 
   by contrast the impeachment resolution that i will vote to table on 
 june be draft in isolation by member and representative 
 green introduce it a mere hour before he come to the floor to 
 push it to a vote it be rush to the floor with no coordination with 
 the large body of we who be work to hold president trump 
 accountable it be not a serious attempt to gather the evidence and 
 convince the american people of the grave nature of the president&#x27;s 
 violation of the law and the constitution 
   currently the house of representatives be control by the 
 president&#x27;s party and it be clear that their majority be unwilling to 
 take even the most basic step to hold president trump accountable for 
 his illegal and unconstitutional action to be clear the house of 
 representatives have a duty under the constitution to hold a president 
 accountable for illegal conduct this obligation begin with an open 
 transparent process of congressional hearing investigation and 
 subpoena the republican majority control this congress will not 
 allow that work to move forward but a premature and poorly reason 
 resolution like this hurt our ability to progress on the path to 
 accountability for president trump 
   my constituent can count on i to hold mr. trump accountable in a 
 manner that be fully transparent and clearly document his malfeasance 
 as the president of the united states
