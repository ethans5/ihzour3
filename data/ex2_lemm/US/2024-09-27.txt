      through these home be now firmly in mythological 
      territory as be mr. coburn i become aware of mr. 
      coburn and his world in july of when the care home i be 
      live in be put into receivership by the superior court due 
      to various problem i be live in the care home because 
      after i be declare disabled in i could not find 
      housing assistance in mansfield 
        on the evening of july after mr. coburn have just 
      be appoint receiver of the home in which i live a quick 
      but violent thunderstorm knock out the power and the 
      generator fail i call and report the situation to 
      barbara cass of the department of public health and within 
      an hour a truck arrive haul a new generator which be 
      hook up to restore power mr. coburn have rent the 
      generator this be only example of mr. coburn&#x27;s constant 
      generosity if a home that he be in charge of need 
      something he would go out right away and buy it with his own 
      money then later get reimburse by the court if anyone 
      live in of his home have exceptional need or 
      circumstance he accommodate they he be always available 
      to lend a help hand a listen ear or a ride to 
      dialysis 
        skille nursing facility have be his specialty a 
      nursing home receivership usually last about year but 
      mr. coburn&#x27;s last run through the pandemic and be 
      approach under another receiver miraculously he 
      remain healthy through most of the pandemic few of we can 
      imagine what he and all those responsible for run the 
      home go through during the pandemic but if you visit the 
      home now and even more so if you live in the home you can 
      see and feel the pandemic&#x27;s mark almost as if you be 
      visit a country where a terrible war be fight the 
      bodies&#x27;of the casualty be go but you can feel their 
      presence everywhere it be quiet and peaceful yet with 
      echo of an unspeakable past and the word ` ` god willing&#x27;&#x27 
      be append to every plan 
        this be the world that mr. coburn leave have serve the 
      frailest citizen of our state during both peace and 
      metaphoric wartime it be in these home that the most 
      helpless of the pandemic&#x27;s victim die and that many of the 
      most courageous of the healthcare worker fight to save as 
      many as they could and to save themselves many people shun 
      the world of these home even if they have family member 
      live in they this be a tragedy in many way because there 
      be lesson to be learn in the home that can not be learn 
      from book lesson for the heart as well as the mind 
      lesson in compassion and even key to the mystery of war 
      and peace eventually most of we will occupy a bed in of 
      these home why wait until then to visit 
        if more people embrace the home with the love compassion 
      and enthusiasm of mr. coburn it would be a well world for 
      all of we both inside and outside the home if there be 
      sure lesson that can be learn from the pandemic and the 
      home this be it
