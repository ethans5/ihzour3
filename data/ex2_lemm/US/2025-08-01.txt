        introduction of the merchant marine allies partnership act

                                of hawaii 

                     in the house of representative 

                          friday august 

   mr. case mr. speaker i rise today to join my colleague congressman 
 jim moylan of guam in highlight the urgent need to modernize u.s. 
 maritime policy through our merchant marine allies partnership act 
 which we have introduce to realign federal incentive in our domestic 
 shipping industry away from adversary such as the people&#x27;s republic 
 of china prc and toward our trust ally with prove mainline 
 capacity such as japan and south korea 
   our measure directly respond to the real world consequence of 
 gap loophole in the merchant marine act of well know as 
 the jones act which restrict domestic shipping include route 
 between the u.s. west coast and hawaii to vessel that be u.s.-built 
 u.s.-flagged u.s.-owned and u.s.-crewed the rationale for this 
 ancient and outdated restriction have always be argue as national 
 security to maintain a strong u.s. shipbuilding industry and merchant 
 fleet capable of support the military in time of conflict 
   but today that argument if it have any merit at all be be 
 dangerously undermine and not by our adversary but by the very 
 company benefit from the monopolistic protection of the jones 
 act 
   specifically jones act loophole allow for supposedly minor part 
 fabrication and supposedly minor repair to be conduct in foreign 
 shipyard use foreign worker with no condition or restriction as to 
 country but these be not minor part but whole section and not 
 minor repair but full retrofit and the preferred source of this 
 fabrication and these repair in the people&#x27;s republic of china prc 
   jones act vessel such as the daniel k. inouye kaimana hila and 
 manukai have undergo major structural conversion include 
 liquefy natural gas lng engine retrofit at prc base shipyard 
 like cosco&#x27;s nantong facility which have know tie to the chinese 
 government and military industrial complex these modification be 
 frequently reclassify as mere ` ` major modifications&#x27;&#x27 to avoid 
 trigger the percent u.s. import duty intend to disincentivize 
 foreign work but ais datum company filing u.s. coast guard 
 correspondence and even photograph confirm that these be anything but 
 routine 
   this pose a significant and immediate national security concern 
 by enable vessel critical to u.s. domestic supply chain to 
 undergo major upgrade in foreign control shipyard of adversary 
 we introduce unnecessary strategic risk these ship support domestic 
 commerce but they also arguably constitute the backbone of sealift 
 capacity that would be require during any military mobilization 
 the continue outsourcing of vessel modification and 
 construction undermine the u.s. shipbuilding and repair base leave 
 we with few than jones act compliant vessel in active service 
 nationwide many of which be age or specialize and it send 
 u.s. dollar job and technological investment directly into the 
 hand of a strategic competitor identify by out national defense 
 strategy as the most significant long term challenge to u.s. interest 
   nowhere be the consequence of this policy failure more acute or 
 more strategically dangerous than in my home state of hawaii locate 
 in the middle of the indo pacific hawaii be not just a remote island 
 economy dependent on maritime commerce it be the linchpin of u.s. 
 power projection and force posture across the indo pacific any 
 disruption to hawaii&#x27;s shipping system be not only an economic risk to 
 our resident but a direct vulnerability in america&#x27;s strategic 
 readiness 
   moreover while jones act supporter continue to claim the law 
 protect u.s. job the evidence say otherwise accord to the 
 grassroot institute of hawaii maritime employment in the u.s. 
 shipbuilding and repair sector have decline by percent over the past 
 year this steady erosion be not due to foreign competition alone 
 but to deliberate business decision by jones act carrier who choose 
 to take advantage of legal loophole that let they outsource high value 
 work overseas while still reap the benefit of domestic 
 protectionism 
   despite these clear defect in the law hawaii and other island and 
 noncontiguous part of our country remain a fully captive market with 
 no viable alternative to a jones act duopoly that prioritize profit 
 over preparedness we see no meaningful return on this federal maritime 
 policy the economic burden of this break system include inflate 
 shipping cost drive by duopoly protection and foreign outsourcing 
 be bear daily by hawaii&#x27;s family and business we have previously 
 introduce separate measure to address these specific 
 consequence 
   the overall answer for our country to this national security risk be 
 not to force any and all fabrication repair and operation exclusively 
 into our country since that just compound a problem we can&#x27;t 
 effectively fix it be instead to cease reward our adversary and 
 start incentivize our international friend and ally to assist we 
 with our domestic merchant marine and related defense sealift need 
   our merchant marine allies partnership act address these problem 
 through a targeted security conscious realignment of incentive 
 specifically the bill exempt the current percent import duty on 
 major vessel modification only if the work be perform in shipyard 
 locate in allied or partner country such as japan and south korea-- 
 nation with world class maritime industry and deep national security 
 alignment with the united states it allow ship construct in those 
 ally country to qualify for the u.s. domestic coastwise trade 
 under a limited jones act exemption thereby expand access to 
 modern secure and cost effective vessel without subsidize 
 adversarial economy finally the legislation establish a regulated 
 pathway for foreign build foreign crew vessel operate by company 
 from allied nation to participate in the u.s. coastwise trade under 
 clearly define national security safeguard 
   this legislation do not repeal or abandon the jones act it 
 restore the law to its intended purpose to serve as a foundation for 
 national resilience industrial strength and strategic security rather 
 than be hijack by the hypocritical umbrella of national defense at 
 the expense of increase cost of consumer good across the country it 
 recognize that modern maritime commerce be global but that global 
 alignment must be root in trust share value and common defense by 
 partnering with our ally and closing loophole that empower our 
 adversary this bill protect the u.s. supply chain reduce security 
 vulnerability and ensure that the jones act serve our people our 
 economy and our military not just corporate bottom line 
   mr. speaker we can not afford to continue defend a system that 
 fail to defend we the merchant marine allies partnership act be a 
 bipartisan commonsense step toward maritime policy that reflect 21st- 
 century challenge and opportunity i urge my colleague to support 
 this legislation and update our maritime policy to modern world 
 reality
