                               of illinois 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday july 

   mr. davis of illinois mr. speaker as we end the session of the 
 supreme court and prepare for student to return to school i wish to 
 reaffirm the need for race conscious decision in high education to 
 ensure that student of color receive fair consideration in admission 
   affirmative action be an important equity tool to counteract the 
 effect of discrimination and structural barrier to education face 
 student of color a tool that emerge from the civil rights movement 
 in the 1960 president john f. kennedy establish affirmative 
 action to promote racial equality and prevent unfair labor practice 
 through an executive order in that create the president&#x27;s 
 committee on equal employment opportunity the landmark civil rights 
 act of go far to prohibit discrimination and promote equal 
 opportunity base on race color religion sex and national origin 
 subsequent executive order law and holding by the supreme court 
 support race- and gender conscious action to address discrimination 
 and enforce the civil rights act of 
   the consideration of race in college admission promote equal 
 treatment without regard to race color religion or national origin 
 the result campus diversity be a crucial element of quality high 
 education diversity curate high learning opportunity and foster 
 a sense of belong for traditionally marginalize community 
 research show that a strong sense of belong have many positive 
 outcome for student include improved persistence retention 
 grade and health diversity in high education expand perspective 
 promote innovation and prepare student to interact with our diverse 
 citizenry 
   year ago the supreme court gutte year of race conscious 
 admission in high education with its decision in student for fair 
 admissions inc. v. president and the fellow of harvard in a 
 decision the extremist dominate court rule that affirmative action 
 violate equal protection under the amendment the amendment 
 manifest new freedom and right at the federal level by establish 
 ` ` equal protection under the laws&#x27;&#x27 for all american citizen 
 regardless of race shockingly and offensively the conservative- 
 dominate court manipulate an amendment intend to cultivate racial 
 equality to stifle program that correct systemic racial 
 discrimination i firmly agree with justices jackson and sotomayor who 
 oppose the ruling justice sotomayor warn that ` ` racial 
 inequality will persist in educational institution so long as it be 
 ignored.&#x27;&#x27 justice jackson note the contradictory nature of the 
 absence of race in admission decision but not in military academy 
 prioritize racial inclusion for military benefit rather than 
 educational enrichment 
   the district of illinois chicago and illinois be home to 
 million of family whose child deserve the same access to high 
 education opportunity that privileged individual enjoy extremists&#x27 
 attack on race conscious admission jeopardize the future educational 
 opportunity of black and brown child a colorblind approach to the 
 college admission process do not acknowledge the entrenched racial 
 struggle that minority face in america when institution fail to 
 acknowledge race they fail to recognize the barrier to education 
 associate with race that can perpetuate racial inequality in high 
 education the supreme court&#x27;s promotion of a colorblind society serve 
 to protect the wealthy and well connect 
   i vow to fight for equal opportunity and justice we must protect the 
 tool that be key to secure our civil right like race conscious 
 admission free and fair election and voter protection to ensure 
 that our nation&#x27;s progress in civil right do not reverse 
 advancement toward racial equality can not be make without consideration 
 of race
