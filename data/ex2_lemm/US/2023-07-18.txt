                                 of texas 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday july 

        the house in committee of the whole house on the state of 
      the union have under consideration the bill h.r. to 
      authorize appropriation for fiscal year for military 
      activity of the department of defense and for military 
      construction and for defense activity of the department of 
      energy to prescribe military personnel strength for such 
      fiscal year and for other purpose 

   ms. jackson lee mr. chair i rise today to speak on the rule for 
 h.r. the national defense authorization act ndaa for fiscal 
 year 
   this be an important measure that for over year republicans and 
 democrats have come together to support investment authorize in the 
 ndaa that will help address the change global landscape and prepare 
 the country for future challenge and threat 
   i along with my colleague have offer a number of robust and 
 thoughtful amendment in furtherance of a process that have generally 
 be bipartisan work on behalf of america&#x27;s national defense 
   however i be dismayed that this year my republican colleague in 
 the majority have refuse meaningful consideration of the majority of 
 amendment offer by my democratic colleague 
   while i be grateful that of my amendment be make in order the 
 jackson lee amendment no no as report in the rule and 
 include in the en bloc package no it be beyond disappointing and 
 disgraceful that my additional amendment be not make in order-- 
 and particularly one i have offer for many year and have be make 
 in order 
   with respect to my amendment that be make in order i ask for a 
 favorable vote on the en bloc package no in support of the jackson 
 lee amendment no 
   the jackson lee amendment no would require that a report be 
 submit within day of the ndaa&#x27;s passage detail our national 
 capacity to provide disaster survivor with short term housing 
   in the aftermath of emergency and national disaster victim have 
 much on their mind 
   home property business and livelihood may have be damage 
 in the disaster and family friend and community member may be 
 mentally and physically affect by the disaster not to mention 
 additional challenge as they seek to return to work and school 
   as these community begin to face the long process of recovery and 
 rebuilding short term housing be of the thing disaster 
 survivor need to get back on their foot 
   unfortunately my constituent and i be no strange to these kind 
 of disaster 
   in hurricane harvey devastate the houston area affect over 
 home across the city in the aftermath of the storm find 
 temporary housing be of the big challenge to recovery for 
 many survivor 
   short term housing be difficult to coordinate due to the sheer 
 number of houstonians affect 
   as such it be crucial that congress have a strong understanding of 
 our current capability and specifically our ability to provide 
 these survivor with short term housing before disaster strike 
   if vote on favorably this report will not only inform we of our 
 current capacity to provide housing but will also well equip congress 
 to respond to disaster and support survivor in the future 
   in addition to this amendment i offer the below list amendment 
   jackson lee amendment no condemn the action of boko haram and 
 direct the secretary of defense to submit a report on effort to 
 combat boko haram 
   since boko haram have subject woman and girl to unbearable 
 and severe form of abuse include sexual slavery sexual violence 
 force marriage forced pregnancy and force conversion 
   the united nation&#x27;s human rights council report on violation and 
 abuse commit by this despicable organization reveal the negative 
 impact of such violent act on the affected community and 
 individual 
   and this year in march of boko haram displace at least 
 people in fight along nigerian border town and village 
   in april of this year boko haram militant also destroy hundred 
 of home in cameroon 
   despite regional coordination effort by the african union in 
 create multinational joint task force to fight boko haram this 
 violent organization continue to commit gross human right abuse and 
 serious violation of international humanitarian law result in 
 ongoing casualty and further destruction of property 
   the jackson lee amendment no would have support effort by 
 the african 

 page e691 

 union and other international entity to effectively counter the 
 atrocity of this organization 
   the jackson lee amendment no direct the secretary of defense 
 to submit to congress a report on the action take to protect member 
 of the armed forces of the united states from armed attack conduct 
 by militant and terrorist in pursuit of bounty and inducement by 
 the agency organization or entity align with the russian 
 federation 
   in there be report that russia be place bounty on 
 american soldier 
   although these report have not be confirm we must be prepare 
 to contend with such threat 
   the life of our armed forces should be value and protect from our 
 nation&#x27;s adversary 
   it be important that we use our resource to ensure the safety and 
 well being of america&#x27;s service member as their bravery and valor be 
 vital for america&#x27;s success it be our duty to ensure that our troop 
 can return to their family 
   that be why i introduce an amendment to ensure that a report be make 
 detail the action take to protect armed forces member from armed 
 attack jackson lee amendment no would have ensure that we take 
 a stand against attack on our military and continue to protect man and 
 woman serve this country 
   the jackson lee amendment no require the secretary of defense 
 to report to congress on the program and procedure employ to ensure 
 student study abroad through department of defense national 
 security education programs be train to recognize resist and 
 report against recruitment effort by agent of foreign government 
   ten of thousand of american student study abroad each year with 
 hundred of they go through the department of defense&#x27;s national 
 security education programs 
   this past year the national security education program enrol 
 boren fellow and boren scholar in addition to those enrol in 
 the organization&#x27;s other study abroad program protect these 
 student in their time abroad be a priority hence the need for the 
 secretary of defense to ensure student know how to detect foreign 
 intelligence and recruitment effort 
   generate awareness about risk that study abroad student could 
 face overseas will safeguard america from be target by foreign 
 government security measure offer by my amendment jackson lee 
 amendment no would have continue to protect america&#x27;s future by 
 prevent foreign intelligence service from acquire tool to 
 inflict harm on america 
   the jackson lee amendment no require the secretary of defense 
 to evaluate the threat to national security pose by domestic terrorist 
 group and organization motivate by a belief system of white 
 supremacy 
   since white supremacist have carry out at least lethal 
 attack result in no few than death white supremacist 
 attack account for more than half of all fatality from domestic 
 terrorism per the fbi 
   as such the fbi have deem that white supremacist ` ` pose the 
 primary threat&#x27;&#x27 in domestic terrorism fbi report have identify 
 these racially motivate extremist as part of a transnational movement 
 facilitate by online network 
   due to the fbi&#x27;s assessment of a rise threat of domestic violence 
 root in white supremacy it be essential that congress be thoroughly 
 inform on this matter 
   this amendment and the report it commission will provide valuable 
 information and an up to date detailed evaluation of the potential 
 domestic violence threat these group pose move forward 
   in this way congress can well create meaningful policy solution 
 that enshrine national security and safety for all the jackson lee 
 amendment no offer an important proactive approach to 
 combat domestic terrorism

   however i be dismayed that this year my republican colleague in 
 the majority have refuse meaningful consideration of the majority of 
 amendment offer by my democratic colleague 
   while i be grateful that of my amendment be make in order the 
 jackson lee amendment no no as report in the rule and 
 include in the en bloc package no it be beyond disappointing and 
 disgraceful that my additional amendment be not make in order-- 
 and particularly one i have offer for many year and have be make 
 in order 
   with respect to my amendment that be make in order i ask for a 
 favorable vote on the en bloc package no in support of the jackson 
 lee amendment no 
   the jackson lee amendment no would require that a report be 
 submit within day of the ndaa&#x27;s passage detail our national 
 capacity to provide disaster survivor with short term housing 
   in the aftermath of emergency and national disaster victim have 
 much on their mind 
   home property business and livelihood may have be damage 
 in the disaster and family friend and community member may be 
 mentally and physically affect by the disaster not to mention 
 additional challenge as they seek to return to work and school 
   as these community begin to face the long process of recovery and 
 rebuilding short term housing be of the thing disaster 
 survivor need to get back on their foot 
   unfortunately my constituent and i be no strange to these kind 
 of disaster 
   in hurricane harvey devastate the houston area affect over 
 home across the city in the aftermath of the storm find 
 temporary housing be of the big challenge to recovery for 
 many suivivor 
   short term housing be difficult to coordinate due to the sheer 
 number of houstonians affect as such it be crucial that congress 
 have a strong understanding of our current capability and 
 specifically our ability to provide these survivor with short term 
 housing before disaster strike 
   if vote on favorably this report will not only inform we of our 
 current capacity to provide housing but will also well equip congress 
 to respond to disaster and support survivor in the future 
   in addition to this amendment i offer the below list amendment 
   the jackson lee amendment no direct the secretary of defense 
 to submit a report on the naming practice recognize african american 
 service member in the department of defense 
   throughout the history of our nation from the battle of lexington 
 through the battle of fallujah to afghanistan and iraq black soldier 
 have serve honorably and answer the call to duty during our nation&#x27;s 
 time of maximum danger 
   for over year african americans have participate in every 
 conflict that confront this nation 
   besides fight the common enemy of this country with unmatched 
 bravery and valor black soldier also have to confront individual and 
 institutional racism of their countryman 
   african american servicemember have serve with great valor and 
 distinction in all branch of our nation&#x27;s armed force 
   since the revolutionary war black americans have faithfully defend 
 this nation and build a legacy of courage commitment and 
 professionalism 
   like any other group of americans black soldier have serve the 
 armed force with great honor distinction and generational 
 inspiration 
   the jackson lee amendment no would have ensure that the 
 legacy of black american servicemember be duly recognize and 
 honor 
   the jackson lee amendment no require a report to be submit 
 to congress within day of ndaa enactment on the risk pose by 
 debris in low earth orbit and to make recommendation on remediation of 
 risk and outline plan to reduce the incident of space debris 
   space debris encompass both natural and artificial particle and 
 this amendment would address the risk of man make space debris man- 
 make object in earth&#x27;s orbit that may no long serve a useful 
 function can include nonfunctional spacecraft abandon launch vehicle 
 stage mission relate debris and fragmentation debris 
   space debris travel at speed up to mile per hour fast 
 enough for a small piece of man make debris to damage a satellite or a 
 spacecraft 
   there be more than piece of debris large than a softball 
 orbit the earth there be piece of debris the size of a 
 marble or large track by nasa and there be many million of piece 
 of debris that be so small they can&#x27;t be track 
   this amendment seek a report on risk pose by man make space 
 debris solution for reduce risk and strategy for reduce the 
 incidence of more man make space debris be introduce into space 
   jackson lee amendment no would have address these challenge 
   jackson lee amendment no require the secretary of defense to 
 ensure that military academy graduate undergo screening for speech 
 disorder and be provide with their result 
   many officer position and occupation specialist require successful 
 performance on the speech test so it be essential that military 
 academy student be aware of their status as they shape their career 
 path 
   under this amendment military academy student would have the option 
 of undergo speech therapy to reduce speech disorder or impediment 
   thus military academy student who do not perform successfully on 
 the speech test have the opportunity to improve their performance and 
 potentially go on to pursue the officer and specialist position they 
 seek 
   approximately percent of all child stutter as they develop 
 language skill boy be to time more likely to stutter than 
 girl and approximately percent of child recover from 
 stuttering but the remain percent will experience life long 
 effect of stuttering 
   i offer this amendment to help entrant into military academy 
 find the right career fit for their military service after graduation 
   i learn about the issue of stuttering and its implication for a 
 successful military career through the experience of a legislative 
 fellow who once serve in my d.c. office 
   he be a graduate from the united states naval academy with a 
 degree in operations research and a veteran naval officer who be 
 separate from the navy in april because his speech fluency 
 testing result do not meet the naval aviation community standard 
 and so he be disqualify from serve as an aviator 
   at that critical juncture he be not inform about what career he 
 could qualify to fill that would not be impact by the determination 
 regard his speech 
   this jackson lee amendment no would have represent an 
 important investment in military academy student improve 
 transparency and provide avenue for personal improvement ensure 
 quality candidate for vital military leadership position 
   jackson lee amendment no remove bill language about critical 
 race theory thereby reject any effort to inject politic into the 
 armed service 
   in this way my amendment affirm the importance of july 
 the date that president harry truman sign executive order 
 create the president&#x27;s committee on equality of treatment and 
 opportunity in the armed services 
   this executive order desegregate the military and declare that 
 there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all in the 
 armed service without regard to race color religion or national 
 origin 
   this be a major step forward and be the result of dedicated 
 advocacy effort from the naacp and aclu as well as president truman&#x27;s 
 own commitment to the issue 
   the importance of this executive order and the change it bring 
 about can not be overstate the diversity of the military and the 
 equality of opportunity find there be of the major strength of 
 the armed service 
   it be crucial that the armed service continue their commitment to 
 live out the promise of equality and opportunity enshrine in 
 executive order 
   the current provision of the ndaa which prohibit the use of federal 
 fund for critical race theory be largely political in nature and 
 represent a step away from the promise president truman make of 
 equality and opportunity in the military the jackson lee amendment no 
 would have ensure that these 

 page e694 

 political provision be strike thereby affirm the value of 
 diversity and equality of opportunity throughout our military 
   jackson lee amendment no require a report be provide to the 
 house and senate armed services committee on the extent that readiness 
 rely on electricity availability to basis installation and duty 
 station 
   the report would provide an assessment on the military&#x27;s reliance 
 upon electricity service provide by transformer that manage power 
 transmission from high power line to end point the assessment would 
 evaluate supply chain issue impact the availability of transformer 
 and surplus transformer hold in reserve by the military the report 
 would also assess the overall market supply and demand for 
 transformer and any risk that market availability issue of 
 transformer pose to military readiness to ensure recommendation on 
 resolve any risk to readiness pose by supply chain issue with 
 transformer the report would also evaluate the extent if any that 
 extreme weather play on transformer supply as such congress can be 
 well inform on military readiness if supply chain issue with 
 transformer persist and congress can ensure that the basis 
 installation and duty station of the armed service maintain the 
 electricity they need to remain reliable and fulfill their function 
 even in time of crisis induce by natural disaster or supply chain 
 issue this jackson lee amendment no offer a proactive 
 approach to military electricity supply and would have ensure informed 
 response when issue arise 
   jackson lee amendment no help to address military recruitment 
 and retention need by provide the follow modification to the j-1 
 visa process 
   j-1 visa holder who have be legally admit into the united 
 states and have successfully complete month out of a month visa 
 duration or month out of an month visa duration may pursue 
 opportunity to join the military if induct into the armed 
 service they would qualify for permanent residency provide they meet 
 other enlistment requirement military fitness standard have no 
 criminal background and be of good conduct during their period of 
 enlistment and during which time they may pursue citizenship 
   during the year of the war in afghanistan and iraq many 
 military expert express concern that the constant deployment could 
 negatively impact the force with the expectation that few young 
 americans would volunteer to serve in a wartime military the 
 expectation of these expert seem tenable give the current 
 recruitment crisis follow our full withdrawal from afghanistan the 
 summer of 
   with the current trend this recruitment crisis show no sign of 
 abate anytime soon as a result we see shrink number in all 
 branch of our force to put this in perspective the last fiscal 
 year the army miss its recruitment goal by about active duty 
 soldier roughly percent of its target consequently the army be 
 force to cut its project active duty end strength from about 
 down to around shrink number be not cause by strategic 
 choice but largely due to the lack of qualified volunteer the 
 jackson lee amendment no would have address this recruitment 
 crisis with serious implication for our strategic position in this 
 increasingly uncertain and dangerous world 
   the jackson lee amendment no l510 direct the secretary of defense 
 to establish a task force day after enactment that will report to 
 the house and senate armed services committees and make publicly 
 available an annual report that explain the progress make over the 
 history of the department of defense and its predecessor department 
 department of war and experience in integrate african americans 
 into the branch of the armed service and the civilian staffing of 
 pentagon office and agency 
   the report shall provide information on the lesson learn about the 
 social cultural legal and logistical challenge face obstacle 
 incur advance make and the impact of integration on the 
 warfighting capacity of the nation 
   in this way the lesson of military integration can be draw upon by 
 policy maker charge with the important and necessary work of bind 
 up the nation&#x27;s wound inflict with the governmental 
 legalization and tolerance of slavery in the united states the jackson 
 lee amendment no would have make this possible 
   jackson lee amendment no require the chief of the national 
 guard bureau in coordination with the secretary of defense to submit 
 a report identify the personnel training and equipment require by 
 the non federalized national guard to prevent mitigate respond to 
 and recover from natural and manmade disaster 
   it be always hard to ever fully be prepare for what be to come 
 whenever any form of disaster strike it therefore help to know that 
 the survival specialist of the air national guard be always equip 
 ready and quick to respond and assist the affected community 
 whenever a state of emergency be declare it be because the 
 authority believe that the disaster that have occur or be imminent 
 be severe enough to require state or federal aid to increase local 
 resource to prevent and alleviate damage suffering and hardship to 
 the affected community 
   the air national guard have an exceptionally unique role in aid the 
 prevention and recovery of these form of disaster disaster jackson

 of desalination system on navy ship include reverse osmosis and 
 distillation produce up to gallon of fresh drinkable water a 
 day 
   the u.s. navy have a unique opportunity to share resource and 
 technology that lower the cost of clean water production and use low- 
 carbon energy source now as climate change become an increase 
 national security concern desalinization technology could have 
 ripple benefit for drought concern here in the u.s. and around the 
 world 
   in of the most unstable and geopolitical region of the world 
 the middle east and north africa water scarcity be a severe problem 
 with over percent of the population have little or no access to 
 drinking water currently the region be heavily dependent on their 
 current system of desalination which be expensive and energy 
 intensive as many as out of arab country fall into the 
 category of severe water scarcity and navy desalination technology 
 could make significant improvement in their process address both 
 climate change and security concern
