                     in the house of representative 

                        tuesday november 

   mrs. rodgers of washington mr. speaker i rise today to recognize 
 the lower snake river dam and the value they provide to eastern 
 washington 
   the columbia river system be the beat heart of the pacific 
 northwest this critical infrastructure help transform our region 
 from a dry barren sage brush into of the most productive 
 agricultural region in the world 
   it serve as a super marine highway for farmer to ship their 
 product all across america while keep thousand of truck off the 
 road every year the dam along the lower snake river have strengthen 
 our energy grid lower energy cost and make we a leader in reduce 
 carbon emission 
   they help prevent life threaten blackout during extreme weather 
 not just in washington state but in california idaho oregon 
 montana and wyoming they also support a thriving tourism economy of 
 small business and protect part of our region from devastating 
 flood 
   to put it simply the columbia river system be critical to our entire 
 way of life 
   thank to historic investment by congress through the year the 
 lower snake river dam be nearly transparent to salmon with some 
 of the most effective fish passage system in the nation these dam 
 have achieve an average survival rate for ocean bind juvenile salmon 
 of between and percent for adult that average be more than 
 percent 
   the scientific evidence support the reality that dam and salmon 
 can and do co exist accord to a evaluation conduct by the 
 u.s. army corps of engineers percent of juvenile and 
 percent of all yearling chinook salmon safely bypass the low 
 granite darn a survival rate that exceed the noaa biological 
 performance standard of percent 
   the same study find that steelhead salmon enjoy a percent 
 juvenile survival rate and an overall dam passage rate of percent 
 on top of that available datum suggest that be the high count 
 for adult sockeye salmon on record at lower granite dam with 
 adult return 
   despite the rhetoric surround the lower snake river dam and 
 salmon we continue to see improvement in the return with 
 currently on track to be the straight year of exceed the 10- 
 year average sockeye return 
   this be not a coincidence the lower snake river dam utilize some of 
 the most informative technology we have to help fish migrate the river 
 include fish slide and fish ladder to help salmon get over the dam 
 safely fish friendly turbine spillway and bypass facility 

 page e1132 

   as a result a recent study conduct by noaa fisheries conclude 
 that survival rate along the snake river system be approach level 
 see on river without dam in fact this study find that wild 
 juvenile steelhead transport through the dam by barge return as an 
 adult at an percent high rate than in river migrating fish 
   in before the dam be build it be estimate that 
 salmon and steelhead return to the mouth of the columbia 
 river in that estimate grow to we do not have to 
 choose between save our dam and preserve our salmon population 
 we can continue to protect endangered salmon without sacrifice our 
 way of life 
   the lower snake river dam be critical for strengthen our energy 
 grid and provide our region with some of the low energy cost in 
 the nation they help give we our competitive edge in the pacific 
 northwest roughly percent of the power consume come from 
 hydroelectricity in washington state alone that figure be close to 
 percent 
   low granite dam alone have hydroelectric generator that 
 generate up to megawatt mw of energy each together they have 
 the capacity to generate megawatt which be enough electricity to 
 power a city the size of portland oregon 
   ice harbor dam another part of the colulnbia snake river system can 
 generate enough electricity to power all of the home in spokane 
 spokane valley and wenatchee perhaps of the most underappreciated 
 aspect of the hydropower produce by these dam be that it can be 
 dispatch at a moment&#x27;s notice help family and business keep 
 their light on year round 
   the columbia snake river system also serve as a super marine highway 
 for farmer to ship their product all across america and around the 
 world all while reduce carbon emission and lower shipping cost 
   each year nearly percent of all u.s. wheat export be barge on 
 the snake river additionally roughly ton of wood chip be 
 barge between location on the lower columbia river and lewiston 
 idaho where they be turn into pulp for paper production at mill 
 across our region 
   in approximately ton of cargo be transport 
 through the snake river dam it would have take more than rail 
 car or semi truck to transport that amount of cargo on land 
 if these dam be breach it would lead to an increase in diesel 
 fuel consumption by nearly gallon per year it would also 
 result in an increase in co2 and other harmful emission by more than 
 ton per year 
   the increase trucking activity would- also increase the cost of 
 fuel highway and terminal facility maintenance driver time and 
 vehicle maintenance by more than $ per year all of which 
 would be pass on to consumer 
   the bottom line be that tear out the lower snake river dam would 
 not only diminish grid reliability and make it hard for local farmer 
 to feed the world it would be counterproductive to achieve our 
 carbon reduction goal 
   mr. speaker i ask my colleague to join i in recognize the 
 enormous benefit the lower snake river dams provide for the 
 people of eastern washington and for the entire pacific northwest
