 prevent gun from fall into the hand of those who intend to cause 
 harm 
   since its enactment the brady bill have block almost 
 prohibit gun transaction 
   year later the brady bill continue to save countless life 
 each day because background check work 
   as we celebrate endure milestone that have transform our 
 country i can not help but remember the life that have be selfishly

   so in addition to celebrate the success of the brady bill i would 
 like to take a moment to urge the passage of an additional necessary 
 piece of gun violence prevention legislation h.r. the kimberly 
 vaughan firearm safe storage act 
   this bill be name after kimberly vaughan a year old girl who 
 be among the life we lose during the devastating santa fe high 
 school shooting on may 
   h.r. will establish good practice for firearm storage to protect 
 child from improperly store or misuse firearm and establish a 
 grant program for local government and nonprofit to distribute safe 
 storage device 
   in particular the attorney general be direct to establish 
 voluntary good practice relate to safe firearm storage and publish 
 they on a website and in print 
   secondly it will require most weapon to have a clear write notice 
 on the packaging that say ` ` safe storage save lives&#x27 and how to 
 obtain the good practice establish by the attorney general 
   additionally the bill will provide grant to state and local 
 government with a year $ grant program to distribute 
 safe storage device 
   as ranking member of the subcommittee on crime and federal government 
 surveillance member of the gun violence prevention task force and co- 
 found member of the children&#x27;s caucus gun violence prevention and 
 the protecting of child be deeply important to i 
   and so in highlight the importance of pass bill such as h.r. 
 we must also reflect and remember the life of those lose to 
 senseless gun violence 
   kimberly vaughan love cat harry potter and regularly take trip 
 to the library 
   she be draw geometric shape in her period art class when 
 she be tragically kill by a year old student who be on a 
 shooting rampage 
   that student ultimately massacre student teacher and wound 
 other at santa fe high school in texas 
   it be the bad school shooting since people be kill at 
 marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland florida just 
 month prior 
   the shotgun and the caliber pistol the shooter take to school 
 belong to his father and be available to he at his home 
   firearm injury be the lead cause of death for child and young 
 adult in the united states 
   although american child be ` ` twice as likely to be shoot and 
 kill as they be to die drowning,&#x27;&#x27 there be more safety regulation 
 for pool than gun storage accord to a report by everytown for gun 
 safety 
   every year almost child be shoot and kill or wound by 
 a firearm and be expose to gun violence 
   in u.s. household with child have firearm and firearm 
 account for nearly percent of childhood death in a 
 percent increase since 
   on average minor be kill by improperly store or misuse gun 
 every day 
   in my home state of texas more than texans be shoot and kill 
 each year 
   safe storage practice be critically important to keep firearm away 
 from dangerous individual and to keep child and family safe from 
 senseless gun violence 
   in the last decade nearly firearm have be report 
 steal 
   between and police recover more than steal 
 firearm that be use to commit kidnapping armed robbery sexual 
 assault murder and other violent crime 
   an estimate minor live in home with at least 
 unlocked loaded firearm on average child be kill by 
 improperly store or misuse gun every day 
   the passage of the brady bill remind we that bold action to prevent 
 gun violence be possible 
   americans should be safe from gun violence in their home and 
 neighborhood 
   americans should not be shoot at super bowl parade 
   americans should not be shoot in their school 
   americans should not be shoot at their place of worship 

 page e199 

   it be simply unconscionable that gun be now the lead cause of 
 death of child and teen in america 
   just year ago i join congress in pass the bipartisan safer 
 communities act the major gun violence prevention law since the 
 brady bill 
   already this legislation be save life but we need bold action 
 it be long past the time to do something about the epidemic of gun 
 violence in our nation the nation that pride itself on protect our 
 child and the future generation if we want to protect americans 
 we must start by learn how to effectively store gun in the home 
 that choose to have they 
   american want more than thought and prayer

 solution

        in the late nineties pearson who not only study his 
      bible but also study its root foundation and original 
      language of hebrew come to a realization that would shake 
      the foundation of his faith and his social standing within 
      the church 
        ` ` when my little girl be an infant i be watch the 
      evening news and the hutus and the tutsis be return to

      television and the plate of food he be in the middle of 
      eating know the culture of the people on the screen and 
      assume they be not all christian he say ` ` god i don&#x27;t 
      know how you can call yourself a love sovereign god and 
      allow these people to suffer this way and just suck they 
      right into hell.&#x27;&#x27 pearson hear a voice say ` ` can&#x27;t you 
      see they&#x27;re already there that&#x27;s hell you keep create 
      that for yourself i&#x27;m take they into my presence.&#x27;&#x27 
      pearson have a realization ` ` we do that to ourselves and to 
      each other,&#x27;&#x27 he recall in the podcast episode

      congregation urge they to stop

      want they to send a message that they be ` ` safe with 
      god.&#x27;&#x27 
        but this new theology of inclusion and universalism mark 
      his downfall within the evangelical mainstream congregant 
      leave the church preacher like t.d. jakes speak out against 
      he jakes tell charisma magazine a popular christian 
      publication that pearson be wrong and have incorrectly 
      interpret the bible many church and leader turn their 
      back on he he lose his church both its member and the 
      building he be ban from host the azusa conference at

      the mayor of tulsa the city with the bad race riot in 
      know as the black wall street massacre he lose 
        ` ` i tell carlton that if he tell they he believe there be 
      no such thing as hell and damnation he will reduce this 
      weapon of fear base religion which be the foundation of 
      religious institution money,&#x27;&#x27 say bishop yvette flunder a 
      friend of pearson and a same gender love preacher and 
      singer who sing with the hawkins family ` ` his colleague and 
      the college of bishops that he be a part of put he on blast 
      and say he be a heretic and excommunicate him.&#x27;&#x27 
        charisma magazine didn&#x27;t let the issue rest accord to 
      reid they write about pearson for year demonize his 
      theology and teaching

      lot of it result in he become physically sick around 
      that time he have his bout with cancer we be 
      and when we know it be our last service.&#x27;&#x27 
        while no long popular in the mainstream church pearson&#x27;s 
      ministry continue through his church new dimensions where 
      he preach against homophobia and embrace the lgbtq
