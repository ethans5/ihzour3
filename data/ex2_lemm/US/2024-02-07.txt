                        tuesday february 

   ms. lee of california madam speaker i rise to address the ongoing 
 challenge that too many family in america face cop with poverty 
 and income inequality i thank my dear friend congressman desaulnier 
 for hose this special order hour and for his tireless work on these 
 issue 
   in the rich country in the world poverty be a policy choice in 
 early the poverty rate in california rise to percent and 
 the child poverty rate to percent 
   you can not disentangle poverty and inequality from systemic racism 
 latinos remain disproportionately poor latinos comprise about half 
 of poor californians but only around percent of all californians 
 additionally about percent of african americans and percent 
 of asian americans pacific islanders live in poverty in california at 
 the beginning of compare to percent of white resident that 
 be why i reintroduce legislation call for the establishment of the 
 u.s. commission on truth racial healing and transformation 
 this commission will examine the effect of slavery institutional 
 racism and discrimination against people of color and how our history 
 impact law and policy today 
   but while poverty have a disproportionate impact on people of color 
 poverty afflict million of people in america of all racial and ethnic 
 background that be why i have work with the poor people&#x27;s campaign 
 to introduce a resolution call for a reconstruction to fully 
 address poverty from the bottom up a reconstruction would 
 prioritize the need and demand of the people in america 
 who be poor or emergency away from economic desperation with 
 policy focus on healthcare welfare water public education and 
 housing 
   across the country rent and home price continue to rise much 
 fast than income exacerbate housing instability during an 
 affordable housing supply crisis a staggering percent of extremely 
 low income renter in california be severely cost burden mean 
 they spend more than half of their income on housing and utility 
 this be unacceptable when we have the power and tool to eliminate 
 poverty entirely 
   access to safe and affordable housing regardless of income be a 
 human right i be proud to sponsor the deposit act which would provide 
 security deposit assistance to low income renter 
   as chair of the house democratic caucus poverty task force i won&#x27;t 
 stop fight until we pass comprehensive legislation to eradicate 
 poverty economic inequality and racial injustice there be a strong 
 correlation between u.s. poverty reduction initiative and decline 
 poverty rate we must work to ensure that the child tax credit be 
 restore to american rescue plan level which cut child poverty in 
 half 
   we must ensure the house remain focused on combat poverty in all 
 form and create economic opportunity for all americans together we 
 can work to reduce disparity and secure justice for those struggle 
 to put food on the table
