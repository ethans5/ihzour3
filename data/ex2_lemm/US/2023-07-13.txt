 support as the original cosponsor and u.s. senators mike braun r in 
 and sherrod brown d oh for sponsor the companion 
   this bipartisan bicameral legislation would strengthen enforcement 
 of the exist ` ` buy american&#x27;&#x27 requirement under the u.s. department 
 of agriculture&#x27;s usda in school meal program current law require 
 school district to purchase domestically source food product for all 
 federally fund in school meal and afterschool snack under the 
 national school lunch program however even in agricultural 
 community like california&#x27;s central valley school district continue 
 to misuse taxpayer dollar to buy import food unnecessarily 
 without inform parent in numerous case these same import food 
 have be recall due to safety concern and outbreak of foodborne 
 disease this be especially troubling as those same food could have 
 be source locally in the place as require by federal law 
   that be why our bipartisan bill would increase public transparency by 
 allow parent to know from where the food serve to their child 
 in school come school district would be require to obtain a waiver 
 from usda to use federal taxpayer dollar to purchase foreign source 
 food product when unavailable domestically by require usda to post 
 on line all waiver grant for purchase of foreign source food 
 serve to student our bill would provide american farmer the 
 opportunity to seek out school district in need of affordable 
 domestically grow food 
   in the congress we include a ` ` buy american&#x27;&#x27 enforcement 
 provision for the richard b. russell national school lunch program in 
 the agriculture improvement act of pub l. commonly 
 know as the farm bill we also clarify the seafood catch by 
 untied states flag vessel or within our exclusive economic zone at sea 
 be domestically source food for the usda in school meal program 
 this be a step in address this critical issue for american 
 farmer and parent with school age child now congress need to 
 finish the job by pass our ` ` american food for american schools 
 act&#x27;&#x27 into law 
   mr. speaker i hope all members will join we in cosponsor the 
 ` ` american food for american schools act.&#x27;&#x27 our nation&#x27;s schoolchildren 
 should be serve nutritious american grow food produce under the 
 strict food safety standard in the world as require by federal 
 law that be exactly what our bill would accomplish i look forward to 
 work with the committee on education and labor to ensure that our 
 bipartisan bill be include in any future child nutrition 
 reauthorization or the upcoming farm bill
