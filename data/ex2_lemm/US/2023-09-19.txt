                               of virginia 

                     in the house of representative 

                       tuesday september 

   mr. scott of virginia mr. speaker i rise today to acknowledge that 
 year ago on september president george w. bush sign the 
 prison rape elimination act or prea into law this law recognize the 
 difficult truth of rampant and completely unacceptable sexual abuse of 
 people in our jail prison and juvenile detention facility and 
 endeavor to address it prea seek to end these abuse by create 
 research mandate promulgate national standard and provide grant 
 funding to meet those standard 
   end prisoner rape remain of the increasingly rare topic on 
 which people on both side of the aisle can continue to agree i join 
 force with my virginia colleague congressman frank wolf to sponsor 
 the bill in this chamber and senators ted kennedy and jeff sessions 
 sponsor prea in the senate prea pass with unanimous support in 
 both the house and senate fight against institutional abuse and 
 protect those who can not advocate for themselves should never be a 
 partisan issue and i have be gratify by the coalition of support 
 prea have inspire over the year 
   since prea&#x27;s passage we&#x27;ve see dramatic improvement in how adult 
 and child in detention be treat thousand of correction 
 professional have be hire and train to ensure the safety of 
 people in their custody through the implementation of prea&#x27;s national 
 standard the u.s. department of justice be now require to gather 
 datum on sexual abuse in custody that provide correction facility 
 advocate and policymaker with invaluable information on the dynamic 
 of sexual abuse in detention and how it can be stop 
   hundred of thousand of incarcerated people be educate every year 
 about their right 

 page e863 

 to be safe and respected and how to speak out if they be not 
 incarcerated people their family and advocate now have more 
 effective method of report sexual abuse as evidence by the 
 dramatic increase in the number of report we have see since prea&#x27;s 
 enactment this be a clear sign that incarcerated survivor understand 
 that people care about their experience that they have mechanism to 
 advocate for themselves and that their voice should no long go 
 unheard through these effort and sustain support for survivor the 
 stigma of reporting abuse have be steadily erode since prea&#x27;s 
 passage 
   i also want to acknowledge the broad base coalition of advocate and 
 civil right group that fight to pass prea encourage correction 
 facility to implement prea&#x27;s national standard and continue to 
 ensure that the law live up to its intended purpose and promise 
 specifically people who have endure this abuse have be on the front 
 line of the effort to make our prison and jail place where people 
 be free of sexual abuse just detention international&#x27;s survivor 
 council deserve special mention these courageous survivor have 
 fight tirelessly to ensure that no ever have to face abuse and to 
 instill in all of we the principle that no matter what crime a person 
 have commit rape be not part of the penalty 
   the work we set out to do with prea be by no mean over rape in 
 prison be still far too common and young people lgbtq+ individual 
 immigrant and people who come from community of color be more 
 affect by this crisis than other the recent case of staff sexual 
 abuse in california at the federal correctional institution dublin 
 fci dublin at the high level expose and illustrate the impunity 
 with which many staff perpetrator still operate make thing bad 
 the dozen of woman at fci dublin who be abuse could not initially 
 get support service this highlight a large problem of a lack of 
 resource for community service provider 
   prison jail and youth detention facility nationwide must commit 
 to implement the national prison rape elimination act standard 
 this doesn&#x27;t mean merely change policy as they&#x27;re write on paper 
 it mean meaningfully adopt those policy and shift the culture 
 on the ground in detention facility this encompass everything from 
 safe reporting procedure for survivor to strong investigation 
 after an assault occur we must empower staff to identify sign that 
 incarcerated people be be abuse and to identify red flag in 
 staff behavior that could result in abuse we must also have more 
 confidential emotional support service in prison especially from 
 community provider so that survivor can get the help they deserve 
 and finally we must end the culture of impunity and the code of 
 silence among staff which allow abuse to flourish as i have before i 
 call on the department of justice to work vigorously to ensure that 
 every state implement prea to protect all inmate from sexual 
 violence 
   mr. speaker on the anniversary of its enactment let we take 
 this moment to recognize the way that prea mark an important shift 
 in how we as a country deal with this violence sexual abuse in 
 detention may not be a secret epidemic anymore but it be incumbent 
 upon we to actualize the goal set out in this historic law and end this 
 crisis once and for all let i say again rape be not part of the 
 penalty
