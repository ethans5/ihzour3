 political subdivision of a state such as a city or county for the 
 purpose of eligibility for federal funding unless otherwise provide 
 in a statute d.c. operate as the functional equivalent of a state 
 city and county and d.c. resident pay all federal taxis therefore 
 d.c. deserve to be eligible for federal funding available for each 
 level of government 
   while federal statute generally expressly treat d.c. as a state for 
 federal funding and 

 page e144 

 most federal grant go to state federal statute that provide federal 
 funding directly to political subdivision be often silent on whether 
 d.c. be to be treat as a political subdivision in the absence of 
 clear language in a statute federal agency be inconsistent in their 
 treatment of d.c.&#x27;s eligibility for federal funding 
   by amend title of the u.s. code to deem d.c. as both a state and 
 political subdivision for federal funding this bill would 
 automatically correct imprecise treatment of d.c.&#x27;s eligibility for 
 federal funding in exist and future statute and remove discretion 
 from federal agency in their treatment of d.c.&#x27;s eligibility for 
 federal funding 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill

 page e142 

 against the armenian resident of sumgait azerbaijan from february 
 to azerbaijani mob assault and kill armenians leave 
 dozen of armenian civilian dead and hundred injure woman and girl 
 be rap and some victim be burn alive after be torture and 
 beat those who survive the carnage flee their home and business 
 leave behind all but the clothe on their back 
   in a pattern all too familiar to the armenian people the azerbaijani 
 authority make little effort to punish those responsible instead 
 attempt to cover up the atrocity in sumgait to this day as well 
 as deny the role of senior government official in instigate the 
 violence 
   in the year that follow this unspeakable massacre armenians 
 live in kirovabad baku and maragha suffer a similar fate these 
 pogrom be part of a pattern of hateful racist anti armenian 
 propaganda and activity occur throughout azerbaijan dehumanize 
 its armenian resident and lay the groundwork for decade of 
 aggression and mass violence this brutality culminate when the 
 azerbaijani government initiate war against the people of nagorno- 
 karabakh also know as artsakh 
   begin on september and over day azerbaijani force 
 invade and murder innocent armenians in artsakh and displace ten 
 of thousand more they continue to terrorize the people of artsakh in 
 subsequent military attack and by block the lachin corridor which 
 leave people without access to food water medical supply and 
 service gas and electricity for over month on september 
 the aliyev regime take full advantage of a people they have 
 systematically starve and launch a large scale attack far 
 escalate their ethnic cleansing and genocidal campaign against the 
 indigenous armenian people of artsakh at least people be kill 
 wound over ethnic armenians be forcibly displace and 
 azerbaijan now hold artsakh&#x27;s political and military leadership 
 civilian and prisoner of war hostage with no help from the 
 international community to confront azerbaijan&#x27;s military aggression 
 artsakh be force to negotiate under duress and consequently agree to 
 dissolve their democratically elect government 
   there be also real and grow concern that aliyev have his eye set 
 on land beyond artsakh and will continue to seek further territory and 
 concession from armenia by force to this day azerbaijani force 
 remain present on sovereign armenian land in violation of armenia&#x27;s 
 sovereignty and territorial integrity and last month president aliyev 
 make alarming remark include his refusal to remove troop from 
 armenian territory these be the horrific consequence when aggression 
 and hatred grow unchecked and when aliyev&#x27;s hostility be meet with 
 deafen silence embolden he to continue and expand his 
 unprovoked attack on the armenian people know there will be no 
 repercussion 
   azerbaijan&#x27;s campaign of death and destruction against armenians have 
 be nothing short of deplorable include the destruction of 
 religious and cultural site in artsakh to erase or falsify history 
 and the torture mutilation and killing of armenian civilian 
 prisoner of war and soldier this february also mark year of a 
 horrific crime when ramil safarov an azerbaijani army captain savagely 
 murder an armenian army lieutenant gurgen margaryan with an axe 
 while he sleep the be participate in a nato partnership for 
 peace exercise at the time in hungary in safarov be send home 
 to azerbaijan purportedly to serve out the remainder of his sentence 
 instead he be pardon promote and parade through the street of 
 baku as a return hero there be no more dramatic illustration of 
 azerbaijan&#x27;s continued posture of hatred towards their armenian 
 neighbor than their celebration of a cold blooded murderer 
   though the united states and international partner have condemn 
 azerbaijan&#x27;s aggression and military assault against armenians the 
 time for strong statement alone have clearly long pass condemnation 
 must be follow by real consequence the united states must hold 
 azerbaijan and its leadership accountable and take concrete action and 
 press azerbaijan to return to compliance with international law and 
 order crime against humanity can not be ignore and can not go 
 unanswered 
   the united states must use its immense bully pulpit to apply direct 
 pressure to the aliyev regime in azerbaijan by enforce restriction 
 on additional military assistance to baku pursuant to section and 
 call on azerbaijan to immediately return all armenian pows 
 hostage and other detainee and provide information on the status of 
 those still be detain or miss additionally the biden 
 administration should immediately implement sanction under the 
 magnitsky act against azeri official responsible for human right 
 abuse 
   the united states must also demand an immediate withdrawal of azeri 
 force from the sovereign territory of the republic of armenia provide 
 security assistance to armenia include expand humanitarian aid to 
 assist artsakh refugee and help ensure the safety and security of 
 armenians who seek to return to their home in artsakh finally the 
 u.s. department of state must continue to call attention to the 
 destruction and desecration of armenian religious and cultural site by 
 azerbaijan and urge their safeguarding and preservation only by use 
 every diplomatic tool at their disposal include sanction against 
 azerbaijan can we help guarantee the safety security and continued 
 territorial integrity of armenia 
   as we pause to remember the innocent victim of the pogrom we be 
 also remind that despite the trial the armenian people have face 
 it have not break their faith determination and their will to survive 
 in the face of constant threat from azerbaijan today let we recommit 
 ourselves to do everything we can to bring peace and justice to our 
 armenian brother and sister abroad once and for all
