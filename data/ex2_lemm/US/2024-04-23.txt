                           hon adam b. schiff 

                              of california 

                     in the house of representative 

                         tuesday april 

   mr. schiff mr. speaker year ago the ottoman empire begin a 
 concerted and systemic effort to destroy the armenian people armenians 
 from all walk of life include writer doctor and teacher be 
 round up and brutally murder clergy be torture and burn alive 
 in church woman and girl be brutalize rap and kill son 
 and daughter witness their father be murder and child and 
 the elderly die of exhaustion and starvation on a force march to deir 
 ez zor armenian man woman and child entire family 
 be wipe out in an act of mass premeditate murder 
   the fact of the genocide be horrific and undisputed by historian 
 they be record by american diplomat serve in the ottoman empire 
 at the time who bear witness in official cable to the annihilation of 
 the armenian population the u.s. ambassador to the ottoman empire at 
 the time henry morgenthau describe it as a ` ` campaign of race 
 extermination.&#x27;&#x27 it be the genocide of the century a term 
 coin by raphael lempkin partly in response to this barbarity 
   despite overwhelming and ever increase evidence of this methodical 
 mass killing turkey have long engage in a dangerous campaign to deny 
 the genocide and to silence anyone who seek to speak the truth 
   i have sit down with survivor i have be welcome into their 
 home i have listen to their story of how their parent aunt and 
 uncle be murder how their property and the life that their 
 family build be destroy i have watch they relive the pain over 
 and over reopen the wound to keep the history of their family 
 alive 
   the united states will no long stand in dishonorable silence in 
 the u.s. house pass my resolution officially recognize the 
 armenian genocide by a near unanimous and bipartisan margin that same 
 year the u.s. senate also pass a resolution affirm the fact of 
 the armenian genocide and in president biden finally cast aside 
 decade of shameful silence by our nation to become the sit 
 u.s. president to officially recognize the armenian genocide 
   these historic achievement happen because of a resilient and 
 endure armenian community and diaspora and decade of work it&#x27;s a 
 testament to the effort of thousand of activist organization 
 community and faith leader it&#x27;s a victory for human right and for 
 truth itself and it&#x27;s something that we achieve work together 
   but we know there remain so much important work to do these wound 
 be still open they have not fully heal and in tragic way some 
 grow even large 
   to this day president aliyev of azerbaijan echo the genocidal 
 language and action of more than a century ago with the support of 
 turkey begin on september and over day azerbaijani 
 force invade and murder innocent armenians in artsakh and displace 
 ten of thousand more they continue to terrorize the people of 
 artsakh in subsequent military attack and by block the lachin 
 corridor leave ethnic armenian people without access to 
 food water medical supply and service gas and electricity for 
 over month and then in the aliyev regime take full advantage 
 of a people they have systematically starve to ethnically cleanse 
 artsakh&#x27;s indigenous armenian population from their land 
   as we mark the anniversary of the armenian genocide with 
 pledge of ` x27;never again.&#x27;&#x27 the democratic and peaceful armenian people 
 face threat like never before there be real and grow concern that 
 aliyev have his eye set on land beyond artsakh to this day 
 azerbaijani force remain present on sovereign armenian land in 
 violation of armenia&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity 
   though the united states and international partner have condemn 
 azerbaijan&#x27;s aggression and military assault against armenians the 
 time for strong statement alone have clearly long pass condemnation 
 must be follow by real meaningful consequence the united states 
 must hold azerbaijan and its leadership accountable crime against 
 humanity can not be ignore and can not go unanswered 
   the united states must suspend military assistance to azerbaijan 
 impose global magnitsky act sanction on azerbaijani official 
 complicit in war crime and other gross human right violation call 
 for azerbaijan&#x27;s release of armenian prisoner of war hostage 
 leader of artsakh and other illegally detain person and urge the 
 immediate withdrawal of azerbaijani force from the sovereign territory 
 of the republic of armenia far we must provide robust 
 humanitarian assistance to armenia and the armenian people advocate 
 for the right of displace person and refugee to return to their 
 home in artsakh with a commitment to safeguard their individual 
 and collective property right finally we must also call attention to 
 the destruction and desecration of armenian religious and cultural 
 site by azerbaijan and urge their safeguarding and preservation 
   on this solemn anniversary as we pause to remember the innocent 
 victim of the armenian genocide we also reflect on the resilience of 
 those who survive and the perseverance of their child and 
 grandchild who build new life in the united states and around the 
 world speak the beautiful armenian language and enrich our nation 
 with the armenian culture and heritage armenians refuse to let the 
 genocide define their life or to limit their future potential 
 instead they show the world that armenians could face the future 
 with courage know that they have already overcome the bad 
 atrocity of the past 
   despite the struggle the armenian people have face and continue to 
 face it have not break their faith determination or their will to 
 press on they have overcome the harsh of trial and yet they 
 remain strong and unbowe in los angeles in yerevan and around the 
 world i will always stand with the armenian community
