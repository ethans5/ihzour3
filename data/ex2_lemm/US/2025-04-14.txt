   ms. mccollum mr. speaker the republican&#x27;s reckless budget scheme be 
 back on the house floor today propose the same devastating cut to 
 our family and community in exchange for massive tax break for 
 elon musk president trump and their billionaire buddy 
   i be join every democrat in the house and senate in oppose this 
 resolution 
   apparently republicans weren&#x27;t pay attention when americans 
 across the country take to the street last weekend to tell they to 
 keep their hand off our healthcare our education and food assistance 
 for our child our elder and our neighbor in need i be there 
 speak to my constituent and i hear they loud and clear 
   this be not the direction the american people want our country to go 
   but despite that house republicans be use their majority to 
 advance an agenda that serve the wealthy americans at the expense 
 of our nation&#x27;s work family the republican budget be a framework 
 that instruct the energy and commerce committee to cut $ 
 that level of cut be impossible without decimate medicaid the 
 agriculture committee will have to find at least $ in cut 
 which threaten food assistance like snap even as food price be 
 rise 
   let&#x27;s be clear republicans be use these cut to our neighbor to 
 offset their tax break for giant corporation and billionaire like 
 elon musk and even after all these cruel cut their budget will still 
 burden americans with trillion of dollar in new debt 
   president trump&#x27;s ` big beautiful bill&#x27 doesn&#x27;t do anything to address 
 the high cost of live or fix the economic mess create by the 
 president&#x27;s trade war in fact it add more burden for minnesota 
 family who be look for help with the rise cost of living 
   nearly minnesotans about quarter of our state be 
 cover by medicaid a cut of this magnitude would have severe 
 consequence for health care access for the family senior people 
 with disability and especially child who rely on this coverage 
 that include of my constituent here in the district 
 of whom be child on chip in our district 
 minnesotans rely on snap to put food on the table snap assistance be 
 particularly important to child as well as many senior on a fix 
 income the health and well being of our community be under attack 
 by this republican majority 
   mr. speaker i be vote no on this betrayal of our value and our 
 constituent and i will continue to oppose all republican effort to 
 take away food healthcare and basic government service that 
 minnesotans rely on

                          monday april 

   ms. mccollum ms. speaker i vote in opposition to h.r. 
 because if enact as write it would place burdensome duplicative 
 and potentially harmful requirement upon our nation&#x27;s institution of 
 high education without significantly improve our national 
 security 
   my colleague congresswoman tlaib offer amendment to this 
 legislation that raise her concern with how we identify country and 
 investment of concern we discuss these valid and serious issue 
 but i could not support the amendment as write because fail to 
 protect due process and the other omit definition 
   i vote against amendment number from rep. tlaib of michigan 
 because the identification of foreign country of concern should not 
 be base solely on allege violation or warrant due process be 
 important and the way this amendment be draft would impose 
 restriction on a nation base upon allegation not conviction 
   i vote present for amendment number from rep. tlaib of michigan 
 because i share my colleague&#x27;s serious concern about entity who 
 facilitate state violence and violation of international law and human 
 right however this amendment would authorize the secretary of state 
 to make those determination without the definition necessary to make 
 congressional intent clear i worry that absent those definition 
 this authority could be use in a politically punitive manner by the 
 administration but i hope in the future we can revisit this effort to 
 address the serious issue of international human right violation 
   my district have many institution of high education and it be 
 important to my constituent that i take seriously the impact of 
 legislation on college and university student in my district and the 
 institution serve they the deterrent act do contain some 
 proposal that have my support and the support of our high education 
 community like make reporting requirement annual and well 
 align definition like ` ` country of concern&#x27;&#x27 across federal 
 agency 
   however in the name of increase oversight of foreign influence 
 this bill would actually make oversight less effective and create 
 confusion and security vulnerability it would require the department 
 of education to vet contract between institution and foreign entity 
 for security risk with the trump administration attempt to 
 eliminate the department of education it be unclear how the department 
 would take on these extra responsibility 
   i vote against this legislation because it create more problem 
 than solution
