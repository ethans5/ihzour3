                       thursday september 

   ms. pelosi mr. speaker the horrific murder of charlie kirk be 
 reprehensible member of congress pray for charlie&#x27;s wife erika 
 their young child and all who love he during their time of 
 mourning and grief we also extend our prayer to all who be present 
 on the utah valley university campus at the time of this tragedy who 
 will carry the trauma of that day with they forever 
   in recent year a disturbing and unacceptable pattern have emerge 
 individual be target for their role in public life or for their 
 association with political discourse violence of this nature be not an 
 attack on person alone it be an assault on democracy itself mean 
 to silence debate sow fear and tear at the fabric of our civil 
 society 
   we remember the assassination attempt on congresswoman gabby 
 giffords which leave she critically injure and innocent life 
 lose we remember the shooting at a congressional baseball game 
 practice which seriously wound congressman steve scalise and injure 
 other we recall the chilling plot to kidnap michigan governor 
 gretchen whitmer we will not forget the storming of the united states 
 capitol on january which result in the death of law 
 enforcement officer and shake the very foundation of our democracy 
   my own family still live with the trauma of a near deadly attack on 
 my husband paul in our home by an individual seek to kidnap i an 
 act of violence that underscore in the most personal way the 
 escalating threat that public official and their love one endure 
   we have also see assassination attempt on the life of president 
 donald trump the arson target pennsylvania governor josh shapiro&#x27;s 
 residence and family the heartbreaking assassination of minnesota 
 house speaker emerita melissa hortman and her husband and the 
 attempt assassination of state senator john hoffman and his wife and 
 now we be horrify by the murder of charlie kirk target while 
 exercise his right to speak freely on a college campus 
   all of these incident must be denounce unequivocally and without 
 qualification violence have no place in our political process in our 
 community or in our country at the same time we have a solemn 
 responsibility to act congress must work with state and local leader 
 law enforcement and community to ensure the security of members 
 staff and constituent alike so that all americans may fully 
 participate in civic life without fear that also mean we must address 
 the epidemic of gun violence in our country to keep our child and 
 their family safe 
   let we be clear political difference must be resolve at the ballot 
 box and through dialogue never through the barrel of a gun or the 
 threat of violence the strength of our democracy lie not in 
 unanimity but in the peaceful contest of idea together we must 
 recommit to protect that principle and the american
