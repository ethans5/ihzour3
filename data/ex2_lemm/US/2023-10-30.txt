                               of michigan 

                     in the house of representative 

                         monday october 

   mr. walberg mr. speaker i rise today to discuss a critical issue 
 impact million of americans who work hard every day so that when 
 the time come they can enjoy their golden year in retirement 
 october be national retirement security month so it be a good time to 
 both reflect on the retirement reform we have recently enact and 
 look ahead to the remain work to be do 
   america&#x27;s retirement saving system and the retirement outlook for 
 million have dramatically improve because of congress&#x27;s bipartisan 
 work over the last few year our private sector retirement saving 
 system work well for many employee and employer but additional 
 improvement could help more americans achieve a successful retirement 
 for all 
   as a senior member of the house education and the workforce 
 committee i be proud to play an active role in help draft and 
 advance the secure act of into law 

 page e1029 

 last year build on the great work congress achieve with the secure 
 act of secure include almost provision that will help 
 employer offer plan and assist employee in both begin to save 
 and save more for retirement i be especially pleased that my 
 provision to reduce administrative cost for employer by increase 
 the cash out limit for the time in over decade be include 
 in the final law 
   significant issue we still need to make more progress on be 
 provide great access to saving and income option that will help 
 make sure retiree do not outlive their retirement saving americans 
 collectively face a substantial retirement income gap this mean that 
 the amount of money retiree have save compare to what they need be 
 $ short with percent of family likely to outlive their 
 retirement saving accord to the employee benefit research 
 institute 
   this gap be concern and why guarantee or lifetime income have 
 long be a critical issue for i a few year ago as the chairman of 
 the house committee on education and the workforce&#x27;s health 
 employment labor and pensions help subcommittee i be proud to 
 chair a hearing on a range of bipartisan retirement bill of the 
 bill we discuss that day be the increase access to a secure 
 retirement act which i introduce with representative lisa blunt 
 rochester to remove a regulatory barrier for employer look to offer 
 lifetime income solution to their employee that important provision 
 become law in the secure act but our effort to ensure everyone have 
 access to the good lifetime income option remain ongoing 
   early this year i along with representative donald norcross 
 reintroduce the bipartisan lifetime income for employees act this 
 legislation would improve plan sponsors&#x27 and investors&#x27 default 
 lifetime income option and take a crucial step to help american 
 retiree have adequate income in retirement increase the range of 
 saving and income option will help provide worker with the 
 possibility to achieve high return on their retirement investment 
 and great peace of mind that their income will last throughout 
 retirement 
   our bill and other sensible step to improve worker access to 
 guarantee lifetime income must be a part of future bipartisan 
 retirement saving package i be hopeful my colleague will cosponsor 
 the lifetime income for employees act and help we to enact it into law 
   in addition to expand access to lifetime income congress must do 
 more to help all americans achieve a financially secure retirement 
 more than americans do not have access to an employer 
 sponsor retirement plan include percent of worker at arm with 
 few than employee congress should continue to work to help they 
 get access to saving plan as this be the step to help they 
 achieve financial security in retirement
