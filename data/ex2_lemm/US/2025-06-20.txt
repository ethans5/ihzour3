   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 local juror non discrimination act of this bill would clarify 
 that d.c. resident may not be exclude or disqualify from jury 
 service in the local d.c. trial court the d.c. superior court base 
 on sexual orientation or gender identity specifically this bill would 
 clarify that the term ` ` sex,&#x27;&#x27 which be a protect class under the 
 non discrimination law that apply to juror in the d.c. superior 
 court include sexual orientation and gender identity the term 
 ` ` sex&#x27;&#x27 would also include a sex stereotype pregnancy childbirth or 
 relate medical condition and sex characteristic include intersex 
 trait in the congress the house committee on oversight and 
 reform pass a version of this bill 
   d.c. have of the strong non discrimination law in the country 
 include protect individual base on sexual orientation and gender 
 identity however under the d.c. home rule act the d.c. council do 
 not have the authority to amend title of the d.c. code which 
 contain the non discrimination provision that apply to juror in the 
 d.c. superior court therefore until d.c. be give authority to amend 
 title of the d.c. code which of my bill would do an act of 
 congress be require to clarify that lgbtq+ juror in the d.c. superior 
 court be protect from discrimination 
   as the supreme court say in edmonson v. leesville concrete company 
 ` ` discrimination within the courtroom raise serious question as to 
 the fairness of the proceeding conduct there b]ias mar the 
 integrity of the judicial system and prevent the idea of democratic 
 government from become a reality.&#x27;&#x27 similarly the court in batson 
 v. kentucky which be a juror discrimination case base on race say 
 ` ` the harm from discriminatory jury selection extend beyond that 
 inflict on the defendant and the exclude juror to touch the entire 
 community selection procedure that purposefully exclude black person 
 from jury undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system 
 of justice.&#x27;&#x27 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
