       financial innovation and technology for the century act 

                                  
                                 

                           hon betty mccollum 

                               of minnesota 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday may 

   ms. mccollum mr. chair i rise in opposition to h.r. the 
 financial innovation and technology for the century act 
   while i be oppose to this bill i be not oppose to the concept of 
 crypto itself but i have concern about how crypto be currently 
 regulate and believe that h.r. fall short of create an 
 effective regulatory framework h.r. would also result in the 
 massive deregulation of the security market not just for crypto but 
 for traditional security as well this deregulation would remove 
 protection provide by exist security law to protect crypto 
 investor and consumer and remove disclosure requirement that be 
 design to help investor make informed decision additionally h.r. 
 would preempt state law disarm state regulator in minnesota 
 who be often on the frontline against fraud 
   h.r. lack necessary protection for crypto consumer and 
 investor as of today the crypto asset industry do not comply with 
 exist security law and regulation allow consumer to be 
 defraud in fact the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb 
 receive more than complaint relate to crypto between 2018- 
 roughly percent of those complaint be report fraud 
 and scam this bill will only exacerbate this issue we must reject 
 h.r. and work to create a regulatory framework that will protect 
 everyday investor and consumer 

 page e562 

   crypto be the currency of choice for our foreign adversary 
 terrorist group drug and human trafficker child sex abuser and 
 ransomware attacker these bad actor choose to use crypto because they 
 know the industry do comply with security law and regulation 
 allow the group to circumvent regulatory supervisory and 
 enforcement regime congress should be consider legislation that 
 will make it hard for these bad actor to access currency not 
 allow loophole to persist we must ensure to be sure that crypto be 
 not use as the black market for bad actor 
   crypto asset platform where customer buy and sell crypto asset 
 be know to use vertical product and service integration create 
 conflict of interest for the platform some crypto asset platform 
 blend exchange brokerage market making and clear agency function 
 in their platform this vertical integration of product and service 
 have long be prohibit in traditional market because it lead to 
 risk for investor we see this loophole exploit in when ftx&#x27;s 
 ceo sam bankman fried use its affiliated trading firm alameda 
 research as a market maker allow ftx to transfer billion of 
 dollar in customer account to alameda sam bankman fried be now 
 serve a year prison sentence for defraud consumer h.r. 
 bake in these exist conflict of interest allow crypto asset 
 platform like ftx to continue to work against their customers&#x27 good 
 interest for their own gain 
   rather than put forward a bill that would severely undermine the 
 functioning of our capital market congress should instead consider a 
 comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that will promote the 
 responsible development of these digital asset while protect 
 american consumer and investor i urge my colleague to reject h.r.

   mr. edwards mr. speaker i include in the record the follow 
 newsletter to give an update to my constituent to bring awareness to 
 issue surround the border and fentanyl crisis antisemitism and 
 americans&#x27 financial privacy 

        dear friend 
        it&#x27;s be more than a year since the house pass h.r. 
      the secure the border act the strong border security bill 
      in history 
        h.r. would reimplement president trump&#x27;s effective border 
      policy and end this administration&#x27;s border crisis which 
      continue to jeopardize our national security and 
      sovereignty 
        in fact a record break number of national from our 
      adversary china be illegally cross our border in 
      april the customs and border patrol find that in this 
      fiscal year alone they have encounter chinese 
      national a nearly percent increase from fiscal year 
      
        with the rise threat of the chinese communist party 
      ccp border security be paramount to national security and 
      i will not relent in the fight to secure america&#x27;s border 
        i recently speak on the house floor about how the fentanyl 
      pour in through our border have take life in our own 
      community in the mountain and urge that this 
      administration put the american people and close our 
      southern border once and for all 


                     the u.s. must stand with israel 

        as our ally israel be defend itself from terrorist 
      organization it be critical that we continue to stand with

        the president recently announce he would stop military aid 
      to israel at a time when this aid be need to target hamas 
      terrorist and avoid more civilian casualty in what 

 page e563 

      look like an attempt to appease the grow pro hamas 
      sentiment among the left 
        in light of this administration&#x27;s misguided decision to 
      halt military aid to israel a bipartisan group of colleague 
      and i demand that the president provide answer on his 
      decision to withhold shipment to israel 
        furthermore the international criminal court icc issue 
      baseless arrest warrant for israeli official equate they 
      to the terrorist who commit the horrific attack of oct. 
      the icc&#x27;s decision be great news to terrorist around the 
      globe and be a slap in the face to the only free stand 
      democracy in the middle east 
        if i have my way the united states will never abandon 
      israel especially not while it be fight for the right to 
      exist and the right of jewish people everywhere and no 
      country should recognize any legitimacy of a pro terrorist 
      international court

        in china the communist party have be use a cbdc to 
      track the spending habit of its citizen and we can not allow 
      this level of financial surveillance in america 
        that&#x27;s why i cast nc-11&#x27;s vote for the cbdc anti- 
      surveillance state act this bill protect americans&#x27 right 
      to financial privacy by halt unelected bureaucrat from 
      issue a cbdc and be the anti central bank digital 
      currency legislative effort ever introduce in congress

      celebrate national police week and honor america&#x27;s law 
      enforcement hero by pass legislation to support our man 
      and woman in blue

      officer include bill that would 
        require ice to detain illegal immigrant who be arrest 
      charge or convict with assault a law enforcement 
      officer or other responder 
        make sure officer can protect themselves and other by 
      allow conceal weapon possession in more area open to 
      the public

     house committee investigate china&#x27;s role in the fentanyl crisis 

        follow a month long bipartisan investigation the house 
      select committee on the chinese communist party ccp 
      reveal its finding of the ccp&#x27;s role in the deadly 
      fentanyl epidemic that have kill hundred of thousand of 
      americans 
        the fentanyl crisis be of the most devastating 
      disaster that our nation have face and have make its way to 
      the mountain of western north carolina fentanyl kill more 
      than americans daily on average which be the equivalent 
      to a pack boeing crash every single day after all 
      the amount of fentanyl that be consider a potentially 
      deadly dose be as small as the amount that fit on the tip of 
      a pencil 
        this dangerous drug be the lead cause of death for 
      americans age and have lead to million more suffering 
      from addiction while continue to destroy family and 
      community the fentanyl crisis be not just limit to the 
      united states as fentanyl and other mass produce synthetic 
      narcotic from the people&#x27;s republic of china prc be 
      devastating nation around the world 
        this be why the u.s. must swiftly act on the following 
      finding from the select committee&#x27;s investigation to address 
      the root cause of this global crisis 
        the select committee&#x27;s investigation find that the prc 
      government under the control of the ccp 
        directly subsidize the manufacturing and export of illicit 
      fentanyl material and other synthetic narcotic through tax 
      rebate 
        give monetary grant and award to company openly 
      traffic illicit fentanyl material and other synthetic 
      narcotic 
        hold ownership interest in several prc company tie to 
      drug trafficking 
        fail to prosecute fentanyl and precursor manufacturer 
        allow the open sale of fentanyl precursor and other 
      illicit material on the extensively monitor and control 
      prc internet 
        censor content about domestic drug sale but leave 
      export focus narcotic content untouche 
        strategically and economically benefit from the fentanyl 
      crisis 
        the takeaway from these finding be that the u.s. need 
      to take the follow decisive action to address the 
      fentanyl crisis establish a joint task force counter 
      opioid provide law enforcement and intelligence official 
      with the authority tool and resource they need 
      strengthen u.s. sanction authority enact and use trade 
      and custom enforcement measure and close regulatory and 
      enforcement gap
