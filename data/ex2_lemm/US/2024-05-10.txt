 page e480 

      more give these state a great influence in 
      determine the direction of our country 
        we need guardrail to protect our democracy and that 
      include make sure that american citizen and american 
      citizen only be accurately represent in their federal 
      government 
        it&#x27;s time to stop dilute the voice and vote of americans 
      and with the passage of my bill it&#x27;s clear that many of my 
      colleague agree 


           condemn the administration&#x27;s deadly border crisis 

        a major reason we need to stop illegal immigrant from 
      skew representation number in our government be due to 
      this administration&#x27;s disastrous open border policy that 
      have allow more than illegal immigrant to 
      enter our country through our southern border that be more 
      than the population of state 
        president biden inherit policy from president trump 
      that would have strengthen our border security however 
      since biden&#x27;s day in office he have reverse policy 
      that be in place to stem the flow of illegal immigrant 
      and have undermine u.s. border security on more than 
      occasion 
        the house send a strong message by pass h. res 
      which condemn this administration&#x27;s policy that have 
      create this costly border crisis we also urge the 
      administration to take immediate action to end this national 
      security threat and we will not rest until law and order be 
      restore at our border 


    the president&#x27;s clandestine flight of more than illegal 
                                immigrant 

        the house homeland security committee recently release 
      document that identify more than airport location to 
      which the president secretly fly more than illegal 
      immigrant 
        these document be another example of how this 
      administration be jeopardize the safety of americans and 
      our national security and why the house need to pass the 
      strong border security bill in history the secure the 
      border act which would strengthen our border by restore 
      president trump&#x27;s border policy 


                 stand with jewish student and israel 

        you&#x27;ve probably see footage of antisemitic mob who have 
      be defend the action of hamas harass jewish 
      student and disrupt learn across college campus in 
      america 
        the house have launch a probe to crack down on campus 
      antisemitism and we will not stop until jewish student feel 
      safe on their campus and until university that fail to 
      do their part be hold accountable 
        college and university need leadership with a moral 
      backbone to stand up against antisemitism and provide a safe 
      learn environment for jewish student any administrator 
      who refuse to hold these protestor accountable be not fit 
      to lead and should resign 


        taxpayer be shoulder the cost of open border policy 

        during a house budget committee hearing member examine 
      the financial consequence of the administration&#x27;s border 
      crisis and have an opportunity to inform the american people 
      of the true cost of open border policy 
        the white house&#x27;s open border policy have result in a 
      surge of illegal immigrant encounter and influx of deadly 
      drug across our southwestern border 
        this be be pay for by the american taxpayer at the 
      federal state and local level 
        the federation for american immigration reform fair 
      calculate that illegal immigration for alone cost 
      taxpayer $ taxpayer be shoulder $ 
      per illegal immigrant per year for nearly illegal 
      immigrant to cover cost include for housing feeding 
      clothing jailing adjudication education and shelter 
        to protect american life and improve the federal 
      government&#x27;s stewardship of taxpayer dollar secure our 
      southwestern border require a collaborative partnership 
      among all level of government include federal state and 
      local 
        as a member of the house budget committee i&#x27;ll continue to 
      look for avenue to enforce the law of the land and implement 
      a cost effective comprehensive border security strategy that 
      secure our border end illegal immigration and protect our 
      citizen 


    a port&#x27;s significance in the health of u.s. supply chain economy 

        imagine this you go to the grocery store and there&#x27;s no 
      fruit or maybe you&#x27;re build a house and there&#x27;s a steel 
      and lumber shortage why because north carolina&#x27;s large 
      port the port of wilmington have be cut off due to a 
      collapse of the cape fear memorial bridge 
        this collapse would immediately restrict access to the 
      port which contribute $ to north carolina&#x27;s 
      economy every year directly and indirectly support more 
      than job across the old north state and would cost 
      the economy ten of million of dollar each day the port be 
      closed 
        that&#x27;s what the port of baltimore and the citizen of 
      maryland be experience due to the collapse of the francis 
      scott key bridge over the low patapsco river 
        i recently visit the port of baltimore and the wreckage 
      site of the francis scott key bridge as a member of the house 
      appropriations committee our mission be to well 
      understand the collapse its impact on the economy and what 
      will be need to rebuild the bridge 
        the port of baltimore be the nation&#x27;s farthest inland port 
      and the top domestic port for car forest product farm 
      equipment and sugar the port generate $ in 
      economic value to the state of maryland and support nearly 
      job 
        estimate predict the baltimore port&#x27;s closure cost 
      america&#x27;s economy $ each day it be close and have 
      add hour to transportation time for vital good and 
      service that americans rely on every day in the mid atlantic 
      region and beyond 
        ship be have to travel great distance to offload 
      shipment and an estimate truck per day be be 
      divert across the region add hour to their travel time 
      and significantly affect the flow of good across most of 
      the united states 
        maryland&#x27;s transportation secretary estimate that the cost 
      to rebuild this critical pillar of our nation&#x27;s supply chain 
      be nearly s1.9 
        at some point when maryland come to the federal 
      government for our assistance in fund this rebuild i want 
      you to know that i will be support that effort for the 
      sake of our nation&#x27;s supply chain and for the health of our 
      national economy just as i would hope my colleague in 
      maryland would do if such a tragedy be to ever happen at a 
      north carolina port 


                scale back unachievable energy standard 

        if the white house be go to require new product 
      standard for energy conservation the requirement should be 
      feasible and reasonable 
        i cast nc-11&#x27;s vote for the hands off our home appliances 
      act to modify the department of energy&#x27;s doe procedure for 
      mandate energy efficiency standard by prohibit the doe 
      secretary from require standard that be not 
      technologically feasible and economically justified 
        western north carolinians be already burden by rise 
      cost and the last thing we need be more unrealistic federal 
      regulation that far raise price fail to provide 
      meaningful energy saving and take away consumer choice
