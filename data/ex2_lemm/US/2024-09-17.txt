   mrs. kiggans of virginia mr. speaker i include in the record 
 remark submit at the request of a virginia beach constituent rabbi 
 dr. israel zoberman of temple lev tikvah and be a reflection of his 
 view 

                   on the israeli palestinian conflict 

        palestinian award win author and lawyer raja shehadeh 
      be co founder in of al haq the palestinian human right 
      organization the observer load he ` ` palestine&#x27;s great 
      prose writer&#x27;&#x27 and the new york times book review heap 
      praise as well ` ` in his moral clarity and bearing of the 
      heart be self questioning and assistance on focus on the 
      experience of the individual within the storm of nationalist 
      myth and hubris shehadeh recall writer such as ghassan 
      kanafani and primo levi.&#x27;&#x27 
        in his late book with a challenging title what do 
      israel fear from palestine new york other press 
      shehadeh clearly a palestinian patriot who be bear in 
      in the west bank town of ramallah offer we a concise pack 
      yet imbalance perspective on the long and agonizing 
      palestinian israeli conflict that the october 
      hamas&#x27;s vile attack with terrifying holocaust dimension have 
      bring into sharp view with month of fighting and much 
      suffering to both side the detail orient writer and 
      activist be anchor in the palestinian saga of loss and 
      grievance go back to the pivotal victorious israeli 
      war of independence which the palestinians painfully regard 
      as their nakba catastrophe 
        touching be the author&#x27;s reminiscence of grow up in 
      ramallah with his grandma who be a refugee from jaffa ever 
      miss her old home and inculcate in her young grandson an 
      attachment to the family&#x27;s past ` ` for a long time i be 
      hostage to the memory perception and attitude of other 
      that i could not abandon my sense of place be not my own.&#x27;&#x27 
      however follow the war when he be able to visit 
      jaffa his family&#x27;s root gain a realistic sense of 
      belong the close physical proximity be a primary factor 
        shehadeh blame the british for the turn of event 
      culminate in the arab defeat and the palestinian 
      debacle point at the balfour declaration as the root 
      cause state that the to british mandate be 
      dedicate to fulfil the early declare british 
      commitment toward the jewish people i believe that 
      historian would beg to differ regard a gradual british 
      shift in the arabs&#x27 favor and manifest in severe limit on 
      jewish refugee before and after wwii and the holocaust 
      intense jewish military pressure be create as the british 
      empire be disintegrate the author claim that ` ` what 
      happen in palestine be the utter dissolution of a 
      nation,&#x27;&#x27 notwithstanding the acknowledge fact that no such 
      ` ` nation&#x27;&#x27 historically exist yet the israeli jewish 
      narrative support by the bible claim past millennial 
      jewish life and creativity which be cavalierly dismiss by 
      the author ` ` israel treat the bible as a historical 
      document and use it to back up the claim that the land have 
      belong to the jews from time immemorial have be 
      promise to they by the almighty.&#x27;&#x27 
        he bemoan the fate of the palestinian arabs about 
      who remain in israel and be ` ` forced&#x27;&#x27 to 
      celebrate israel independence day admittedly they be 
      catch in a bind but there be no evidence that they be 
      coerce to celebrate israel&#x27;s national festival after all 
      they have enjoy the benefit of become israeli citizen 
      and significant progress of integration be accomplish 
      though challenge remain in a complex scenario with serious 
      security issue there be evidence of grow palestinization 
      of arab israelis while poll reflect no desire on their part 
      to trade their israeli citizenship for an arab there be 
      no mention by the author of the jewish refugee in 
      from arab land who leave under duress subject to 
      pogrom and lose their belonging follow century of 
      discrimination 
        it be hard for shehadeh to come to grip with israel&#x27;s 
      success to establish a modern jewish national identity 
      define by he as ` ` zionist colonization,&#x27;&#x27 with the 
      revitalize hebrew language bestow hebrew name on the 
      rebuild landscape that have carry arab one he point at a 
      non starter proposal of his late father aziz shehadeh 
      follow the war to use the partition 
      resolution then deny by the arabs for a palestinian 
      state abba eban israel&#x27;s legendary foreign minister 
      insightfully coin that the palestinians ` ` never miss an 
      opportunity to miss an opportunity.&#x27;&#x27 indeed the 
      controversial jewish state law of july cause 
      understandable consternation among israeli arabs exacerbate 
      by the dropping of arabic as an official language sadly i 
      share with the author only of israeli jews be literate 
      in arabic that be part of an important discussion concern 
      israel&#x27;s well integration into the surround arab middle 
      east while there be those israelis who prefer a western 
      orientation i suggest that both approach ought be pursue 
      tandem 
        the book&#x27;s part be dedicate to the gaza war 
      trigger by the october hamas&#x27;s massacre which the 
      author thankfully condemn though seemingly impressed with 
      the military aspect of catch israel by surprise as egypt 
      do in the yom kippur war the breaking through the 
      fail plus costly barrier along with the heavy 
      israeli fatality casualty and captive ` ` the brutality 
      of hamas&#x27;s attack and the civilian death toll certainly cast 
      a shadow on their military success 
        whereas an occupied population have the right under the 
      international law to resist they have no right to commit war 
      crime still this time the palestinians do not fit into 
      the role of victim to the israelis it seem like 
      aggressor who be challenge israel&#x27;s very existence.&#x27;&#x27 
        the astute shehadeh be surely aware that gaza be return 
      to the palestinians in by then prime minister sharon 
      follow by hamas&#x27;s forceful occupation and the cruel 
      toppling of the palestinian authority there with no election 
      since the hamas&#x27;s ` ` victory&#x27;&#x27 he regard the israeli 
      response to the october nazi like hamas&#x27;s massacre 
      excessive expect public israeli criticism as back in 
      with the horrific sabra and shatila massacre in lebanon the 
      author though surely know that the christian phalangists have 
      a decisive hand at that time somehow there be no reference 
      also to iran&#x27;s lead role in direct its radical proxy 
      hamas hezbollah houthis and other to prevent the near 
      peace between israel and saudi arabia with the successful 
      foundation of the abraham accords also the author&#x27;s 
      comparison of israel to the once south african apartheid 
      state be misleading 
        i wholeheartedly concur with shehadeh&#x27;s follow 
      assessment ` ` young israelis feel secure enough that they 
      plan a rave night on the border with gaza but when hamas 
      break through israel&#x27;s vulnerability and insecurity be 
      expose israelis be traumatize because they realize they 
      couldn&#x27;t go on with their life in the same way make the 
      same assumption about the reality of the state and its 
      security unless that is they defeat the aggressor.&#x27;&#x27 i 
      also share the author&#x27;s own response to his book&#x27;s title 
      ` ` the very high human and material cost of the war in gaza 
      prove that what israel fear from palestine be palestine&#x27;s 
      very existence.&#x27;&#x27 surely a hamas control palestinian state 
      be not accept by israel for obvious reason 
        i do appreciate shehadeh&#x27;s optimism concern the future 
      ` ` and yet look back at the history of the region it be 
      only after great upheaval that hopeful consequence 

 page e911 

      follow.&#x27;&#x27 however the central question and challenge remain 
      whether separate and contradictory narrative can be 
      reconcile for the future sake of both people 
        rabbi dr. israel zoberman be the founder of temple lev 
      tikvah in virginia beach kazakhstan&#x27;s only bear rabbi he be 
      the son of polish holocaust survivors and spend his early 
      childhood in transit and dp camps in austria and germany he 
      grow up haifa israel
