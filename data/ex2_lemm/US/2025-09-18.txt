                               of illinois 

                     in the house of representative 

                       tuesday september 

   mr. jackson of illinois mr. speaker i rise today in strong 
 opposition to h.r. the d.c. juvenile sentencing reform act this 
 bill be not a serious attempt to address crime it be a regressive 
 discriminatory and counterproductive piece of legislation that will 
 only worsen the challenge face our community 
   this bill would lower the age at which child can be prosecute as 
 adult in washington d.c. from to year old for certain crime 
 this will also have the impact of reduce the minimum age for 
 transfer a juvenile to adult court to be try as an adult house 
 republicans from state south dakota alaska and california-- 
 vote to reduce the age to in d.c. even though the age be in 
 their own state the supporter of this bill claim it will make d.c. 
 safe but the fact and history prove otherwise 
   let&#x27;s talk about the discriminatory nature of this proposal 
 the juvenile justice system in washington d.c. already have stark 
 racial disparity more than percent of youth arrest in the 
 half of be of black youth lower the age for adult 
 prosecution will inevitably push more black child into the adult 
 system a system that be not equip to rehabilitate they 
   furthermore this proposal stand in direct opposition to what we 
 know about juvenile justice and public safety research from the cdc 
 and the national research council have consistently find that 
 transfer juvenile to the adult system increase violence rather 
 than reduce it youth charge as adult be more likely to reoffend 
 than those process in juvenile court this be not a deterrent it be 
 a recipe for a cycle of violence and incarceration 
   this bill would make washington d.c. an outlier in its approach to 
 juvenile justice while the current law already allow prosecutor to 
 charge and year old as adult at their discretion without a 
 judge&#x27;s approval h.r. would lower that age even far 
   even in state with a history of tough on crime stance many be 
 move in a more rehabilitative direction 
   this approach align with a broad national trend include in 
 several republican lead state to reform juvenile justice with a focus 
 on rehabilitation rather than punishment for example texas a state 
 know for its traditionally tough stance on crime have undertake 
 significant reform since these reform have focus on 
 encourage local evidence base supervision for low level youth 
 offender which have lead to a significant reduction in the state level 
 committed population and million of dollar in cost saving while 
 protect public safety juvenile arrest in texas drop by 
 percent between and follow these change 
   similarly in utah republican governor gary herbert sign a 
 comprehensive set of reform in with near unanimous support from 
 the republican lead legislature these reform have also reduce 
 reliance on locked detention by divert more young people into 
 community base program early outcome from these change show that 
 the use of lock detention have fall significantly while the use of 
 diversion be on the rise 
   even in georgia another state that have historically have a low age 
 for adult prosecution there have be a movement to extend the juvenile 
 justice system in the state pass a bill to raise the adult 
 criminal age from to for most crime recognize that this 
 provide adolescent with well opportunity for rehabilitation 
   this bill would make washington d.c. an outlier while the current 
 law already allow prosecutor to charge and year old as adult 
 at their discretion without a judge&#x27;s approval h.r. would lower 
 that age even far in contrast many state be move in the 
 opposite direction raise the age of juvenile jurisdiction not 
 lower it 
   real solution to violent crime do not come from send middle 
 schooler to adult court they come from invest in community they 
 come from support our school expand after school program 
 provide job training and ensure access to mental health service 
   i urge my colleague to reject this misguided and dangerous bill 
 vote no on h.r.
