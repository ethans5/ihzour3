  introduction of the district of columbia zoning commission home rule 
                                   act 

                                  
                                 

                        hon eleanor holmes norton 

                       of the district of columbia 

                     in the house of representative 

                          monday june 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 zoning commission home rule act this bill would give the district of 
 columbia the authority to appoint all member of the d.c. zoning 
 commission commission currently the membership of the commission 
 consist of federal official the the architect of the capitol 
 aoc and the director of the national park service nps and 
 member appoint by the d.c. mayor subject to d.c. council approval 
 federal official be member of the commission even though the 
 commission have no authority over federal property 
   land use be a quintessential local matter despite the d.c. home rule 
 act which give d.c. authority over local matter percent of the 
 member of the commission be federal official who be not 
 accountable to the more than d.c. resident the federal 
 government would lose nothing under this bill because the federal 
 government&#x27;s land use interest in the nation&#x27;s capital be protect 
 by federal law and federal agency 
   the commission create the zone map and regulation which must 
 ` ` not be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan for the national 
 capital.&#x27;&#x27 the mayor be responsible for the local element of the 
 comprehensive plan subject to council approval the national capital 
 planning commission ncpc which be the central plan agency for 
 the federal government in d.c. and approve federal project in d.c. 
 be responsible for the federal element of the comprehensive plan this 
 bill would not alter the comprehensive plan process or the authority of 
 ncpc and the commission 
   this bill would immediately remove the aoc and the nps director from 
 the commission and the commission would at least initially consist 
 solely of mayoral appointee d.c. would have the authority to 
 reconstitute the membership of the commission through local 
 legislation 
   this bill be an important step to increase d.c. home rule i urge my 
 colleague to support this bill
