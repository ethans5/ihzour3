   under the hra ` ` whenever the president determine that special 
 condition of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the 
 mpd for federal purpose he may direct the mayor to provide he and 
 the mayor shall provide such service of the mpd as the president may 
 deem necessary and appropriate&#x27;&#x27 for day unless congress

 responsibility be to protect d.c. resident and visitor and it must 
 always remain under the authority of the d.c. mayor who know d.c. 
 well than the president to accomplish its mission 
   section be also unnecessary in the case of a true federal 
 emergency in d.c. the president can deploy federal law enforcement 
 officer and the armed forces and can request the support of mpd as 
 the capitol police do during the attack on the u.s. capitol on january 
 and as the federal government do on a regular basis
