                          monday july 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce a bill that would require 
 the directors of federal agency the court services and offender 
 supervision agency for the district of columbia csosa and the 
 district of columbia pretrial services agency psa to reside in the 
 district of columbia during their term residency requirement for 
 certain government position be find in federal law d.c. law and the 
 law of jurisdiction throughout the united states the primary reason 
 such law exist be so that government official have a connection to 
 the resident they serve and in depth knowledge of the unique issue 
 and challenge face by resident last congress the house committee 
 on oversight and reform pass this bill 
   csosa and psa be federal agency that focus exclusively on d.c. 
 csosa supervise individual on probation parole or supervise release 
 under d.c. law psa make recommendation regard pretrial release 
 and supervise defendant for the d.c. superior court and the u.s. 
 district court for d.c. the directors of csosa and psa should be 
 require to be d.c. resident since these agency serve only d.c. 
   congress have justifiably require that certain federal official live 
 in the jurisdiction to which they be appoint include u.s. 
 district court judge u.s. marshals and u.s. attorneys similarly 
 congress which control the local d.c. court system have justifiably 
 require local d.c. judge and member of the d.c. judicial nomination 
 commission and the d.c. commission on judicial disabilities and tenure 
 to reside in d.c. 
   there be no reason that the directors of csosa and psa federal 
 agency that uniquely serve d.c. should not be require to live in 
 d.c. these federal official need to be part of the community they 
 serve a d.c. residency requirement for these federal official will 
 lead to well outcome in the criminal justice system and be a matter 
 of fairness for d.c. resident 
   i strongly urge my colleague to support this bill
