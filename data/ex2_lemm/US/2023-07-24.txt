                               hon ed case 

                                of hawaii 

                     in the house of representative 

                          monday july 

   mr. case mr. speaker i rise today to introduce a bill to end the 
 exclusionary and discriminatory practice of private shipping service 
 to hawaii and the other non contiguous part of our country 
   my home state of hawaii be locate almost mile off the west 
 coast we depend on ship more than many other location in our 
 country import well over percent of our life necessity yet 
 people live in hawaii have encounter unfair shipping practice 
   when order essential online we often learn that a 
 particular online store or item doesn&#x27;t even ship to hawaii at all the 
 federal trade commission ftc review this issue and confirm that 
 ` ` some company be unwilling to ship product to alaska 
 hawaii puerto rico and the other territories.&#x27;&#x27 this exclusion 
 prevent a few americans in the non contiguous state from 
 obtain key product that should be available to they 
   as many of my constituent know those who live in hawaii be 
 often deny free shipping option from online retailer it be so 
 painful when a website advertise free shipping and you fill up your 
 shopping cart and input your address only for a red error message to 
 pop up with the news that hawaii alaska guam and elsewhere be not 
 include in the free shipping deal 
   even when company do ship to hawaii the price bear no 
 reasonable relationship to the distance involve the cost to ship to 
 and from anywhere in the united states depend on several factor 
 include the weight and size of your package and service class 
 however accord to the ftc private shipping companies&#x27 delivery 
 option may cost considerably more for a destination in alaska hawaii 
 puerto rico and the other u.s. territory than for the contiguous 
 state for example a pound package send from los angeles to hawaii 
 cost $ but the same shipment from los angeles to new york be 
 just $ this outrageous price be from a private shipping company 
 that categorize ship to hawaii as an international shipment it be 
 hard to believe that over year after become a state and over 
 year after become part of america hawaii be still treat as a 
 foreign country 
   these price discrepancy also bear no relation to the product and 
 be include regardless of the distance between the sender and the 
 recipient for example private shipping company charge 
 approximately $ to ship a small package from seattle to juneau in 
 day whereas the same package would cost approximately $ to ship a 
 much great distance from seattle to washington d.c. in day 
   we the non contiguous area of our country be bear the burden 
 of these discriminatory shipping practice my bill the fair 
 shipping for non contiguous areas act address all problem it 
 would require shipper to support all location within our country it 
 would also end the exclusionary and discriminatory pricing practice of 
 private shipping company to and from my home state of hawaii and 
 elsewhere exclude they from free shipping or charge exorbitate 
 rate in do so we will break these shipping companies&#x27 
 stranglehold on expose community and address another contributor to 
 the sky high living cost in hawaii and other noncontiguous location 
 i urge my colleague to support this bill as a matter of fairness for 
 the people of hawaii and all other americans who do not live in the 
 continental united states

                          monday july 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 zoning commission home rule act this bill would give the district of 
 columbia the authority to appoint all member of the d.c. zoning 
 commission commission currently the membership of the commission 
 consist of federal official the architect of the capitol aoc 
 and the director of the national park service nps and member 
 appoint by the d.c. mayor subject to d.c. council approval the 
 federal official be member even though the commission have no 
 authority over federal property 
   land use be a quintessential local matter in our country despite the 
 d.c. home rule act which give d.c. authority over local matter 
 percent of the member of the commission be federal official who be 
 unaccountable to the nearly resident who live in d.c the 
 federal government would lose nothing under this bill because the 
 federal government&#x27;s land use interest in the nation&#x27;s capital be 
 protect by federal law and federal agency 
   the commission create the zone map and regulation which must 
 ` ` not be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan for the national 
 capital.&#x27;&#x27 the mayor be responsible for the local element of the 
 comprehensive plan subject to council approval the national capital 
 planning commission ncpc which be the central federal planning 
 agency for the federal government in d.c. and approve federal project 
 here be responsible for the federal element of the comprehensive 
 plan this bill would not alter the comprehensive plan process or the 
 authority of ncpc and the commission 
   this bill would immediately remove the aoc and the nps director from 
 the commission and the commission would at least initially consist 
 solely of mayoral appointee d.c. would have the authority to 
 reconstitute the membership of the commission through local 
 legislation 
   this be an important step to increase d.c. home rule and i urge my 
 colleague to support this bill
