                     in the house of representative 

                         saturday april 

   mr. gallagher mr. speaker last year my effort to ensure foreign 
 adversary can&#x27;t control american social medium application be 
 declare dead and tiktok&#x27;s lobbyist be celebrate today i&#x27;m 
 proud to say its on the path to pass the senate and head to the 
 president&#x27;s desk the ccp&#x27;s last ditch attempt to destroy the bill and 
 i personally fail 
   and though i didn&#x27;t expect to have to prioritize my family and leave 
 congress early i&#x27;ll confess this be how i always want to go out on 
 top with the select committee at the height of its influence have 
 just pass the most consequential bill of my career perhaps the most 
 consequential bill of this congress and have just complete 
 historic investigation and with fisa and these national security 
 supplemental across the finish line this congress have complete its 
 most important homework for which the speaker deserve enormous 
 credit 
   i firmly believe the speaker have emerge on the other side of this 
 strong and a statesman any motion to vacate will fail the 
 republican majority will grow as special election seat get 
 fill in the come week and what remain of this congress will 
 involve bipartisan oversight and legislation and though i will be 
 step away from politic i think after this week my republican 
 colleague will have a strong case to make come november that they 
 hold the line for freedom at home and abroad 
   it&#x27;s typical at moment such as these to say ` ` i have no regrets.&#x27;&#x27 
 this be true legislatively and professionally i accomplish my 
 mission and get to chair the most significant committee in the 
 congress yet i have a linger personal regret i wish i have devote 
 more time to build personal relationship with my colleague our 
 time here be frenetic fill with overlap committee hearing and 
 constant fundraising event it&#x27;s hard to carve out time just to get to 
 know your colleague to understand their background and motivation 
 and thereby develop trust 
   where i be able to do that with senator angus king my co chair on 
 the cyberspace solarium commission and with raja krishnamoorthi on the 
 china committee it produce the big legislative success of my 
 year put differently my effectiveness as congressman wasn&#x27;t 
 primarily a function of intellect or op ed write prowess and 
 certainly not fundraise it be a direct result of forge 
 friendship across our caucus and maybe more importantly across the 
 aisle 
   so if there&#x27;s a lesson in that for my successor or any of my 
 colleague it&#x27;s after a grueling day of a meeting still make 
 the effort to get that beer with a member you don&#x27;t know that well 
 drink more tweet less get to know your colleague in real life before 
 trash they on social medium at the end of the day republicans and 
 democrats we&#x27;re all americans citizen of the great country in the 
 history of the world even on our bad day the world be look to we 
 for leadership god bless america
