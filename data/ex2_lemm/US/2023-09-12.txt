                       tuesday september 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the united states 
 commission on an open society with security act of which would 
 create a commission to investigate how we can maintain our democratic 
 tradition while actively respond to the real and substantial 
 threat pose by foreign and domestic terrorism 
   the impetus for this commission be the oklahoma city bombing in 
 its importance grow after the terrorist attack on september 
 and have reach peak urgency since the insurrectionist attack on 
 the u.s. capitol on january the succession of tragic event 
 endure by our nation have lead to a series of sweeping security 
 increase that be deem both necessary and temporary in the moment 
 but create last security infrastructure that be difficult to 
 dismantle and infringe on our open democratic society 
   we must acknowledge and accept that we have enter an era of 
 constant internal and external threat require ever high level of 
 security for our people and public space what we think would be a 
 temporary infringement on our open society have turn into a permanent 
 restriction on how our citizen interact with each other and our 
 democratic institution because emergency typically dictate security 
 decision essential discussion on the proper balance between 
 security individual right and the freedom enjoy in an open society 
 have be repeatedly defer 
   this bill would ensure that these long overdue discussion take place 
 in a public forum with expert draw from across the spectrum to date 
 security planning have be delegate almost exclusively to security 
 intelligence and military expert although their input be 
 indispensable they can not be expect to consider matter outside of 
 their expertise to strike a well balance that give sufficient 
 importance to our democratic tradition we need to invite expert from 
 diverse field to the same table to work together therefore the 
 commission would be compose not only of security intelligence and 
 military expert but also expert from such field as business 
 architecture technology law city planning art engineering 
 philosophy history sociology and psychology 
   we have use commission before to deeply investigate and address 
 unprecedented challenge such as the national commission on terrorist 
 attacks upon the united states also know as the commission the 
 commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states 
 regard weapons of mass destruction also know as the silberman robb 
 commission and the national advisory commission on civil disorders 
 also know as the kerner commission the commission create by this 
 bill would seek to avert a crisis in basic freedom before their 
 infringement become entrenched we can not allow security protocol to 
 proliferate without informed civilian oversight and a thorough analysis 
 of alternative that might well safeguard freedom and commerce 
   furthermore we have have decade to develop security strategy and 
 technology that do not deprive our citizen of access to institution 
 and personal liberty thus far we have either rely on imprecise 
 medieval approach like crude barrier or on intrusive new 
 technology that treat privacy like a privilege instead of a right we 
 can and must do well 
   as the home of our federal government the district of columbia&#x27;s 
 resident have suffer disproportionate infringement on public space 
 personal right and freedom in the name of security public space 
 that serve as the heart of our local community have become restrict 
 zone characterize by a heavy security presence with individual 
 liable to be reprimand for walk on the wrong side of the street or 
 marvel too long at the architecture barrier such as wall and 
 fence be tout as essential security feature while our citizen be 
 leave peer at their democracy from a distance 
   security be not only about reduce life lose and cost it be also 
 about safeguard the institution freedom and value that anchor 
 our country not only for ourselves but for future generation the 
 social compact between government and the people should not be the 
 result of a series of hostage negotiation we must resume reasoned and 
 deliberative decision making begin with a high level commission 
 compose of expert from diverse discipline charge with develop a 
 new course that will protect both our people and our precious 
 democratic institution and tradition
