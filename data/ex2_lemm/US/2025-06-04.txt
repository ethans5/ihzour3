                            hon chuck edwards 

                            of north carolina 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday june 

   mr. edwards mr. speaker i include in the record the follow 
 newsletter to give an update to my constituent on the helene small 
 business recovery act tax cut and beneficial ownership reporting 

        dear friend 
        community throughout western north carolina be 
      continue to pick up the piece to rebuild after the bad 
      natural disaster to ever hit our mountain make landfall on 
      september this include our district&#x27;s small 
      business which be hit particularly hard due to the loss 
      in tourism follow the disaster 
        small business be the lifeblood of wnc&#x27;s tourism economy 
      and many of they be leave suffer from helene&#x27;s 
      destruction thus federal support be vital to help folk 
      rebuild their livelihood and the region&#x27;s economy 
        that&#x27;s why i introduce the helene small business recovery 
      act to facilitate small business owners&#x27 access to federal 
      aid for rebuild after hurricane helene this bill 
      clarify that small business administration loan and 
      federal grant like those that will be offer through the 
      cdbg dr program be not duplicative without this 
      clarification business that take an sba loan to keep 
      themselves afloat would be prohibit from access federal 
      grant money when it become available 
        loan and grant be inherently different and my bill will 
      allow small business owner to access both federal resource 
      so that wnc and every small business that make our 
      mountain such a great place to live have the resource 
      need to recover 
        relieve the tax burden for hard work americans 
        americans be benefit from low taxis because of the 
      tax cut that president trump implement during his 
      term 
        however the tax relief secure in the tax cuts and 
      jobs act tcja be set to expire next year and if these cut 
      be not extend a family of in north carolina will 
      face a tax hike of about $ 
        to prevent tax increase for worker and business 
      nationwide i&#x27;m work with my colleague to extend and 
      potentially make permanent president trump&#x27;s tax cut 
      this would ensure we avoid the large middle and low class 
      tax increase in american history stimulate job growth make 
      american business more competitive and support american 
      worker by help they keep more of their hard earn 
      dollar in their wallet 
        small business victory over beneficial ownership report 
      requirement 
        small business see a major victory in the fight against 
      beneficial ownership reporting requirement with the 
      financial crimes enforcement network&#x27;s new ruling that 
      exempt u.s. small business from have to report 
      beneficial ownership information under the corporate 
      transparency act 
        as we move through the congress i will continue to 
      be a voice for wnc&#x27;s small business owner whose hard work 
      benefit our community and strengthen our economy 
            with my warm regard 
                                                     chuck edwards
