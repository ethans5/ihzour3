   mrs. steel mr. speaker i rise to commend the passage of the mahsa 
 act which be an important step in hold the iranian regime 
 accountable for its continue oppression of its own people 
   however we can not ignore the biden administration&#x27;s late misstep 
 in hand over $ to iran 
   longstanding u.s. policy dictate that we do not negotiate with 
 terrorist 
   unfortunately that be exactly what president biden do with this 
 payoff enable iran to continue threaten the security of the free 
 world 
   i&#x27;ve introduce the bipartisan bicameral solidifying iran sanctions 
 act with foreign affairs chairman mccaul 
   our legislation will hold iran accountable and prevent they from 
 acquire nuclear weapon iran pose a serious threat to global 
 stability and peace 
   we need strength not payoff and appeasement to deter future 
 hostility from this rogue regime
