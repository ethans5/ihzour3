                         friday october 

   mr. torres of new york mr. speaker pro tempore oct. be a day 
 that will live in infamy as the most gruesome terrorist attack in the 
 history of the jewish state 
   thousand of israelis be murder rap torture and abduct as 
 hostage percent of the member of an israeli kibbutz kfar asar 
 be massacre 
   about young israelis party at a music festival be gun 
 down baby be butcher burn and behead 
   the only morally acceptable response to such incomprehensible terror 
 be overwhelming outrage at the boundless barbarism of hamas 
   while most of the civilized world lead by president biden rightly 
 recoil in horror at hamas and condemn its terrorism immediately and 
 unequivocally israel&#x27;s ideological enemy here in the us find cause 
 for celebration at the sight of dead jews 
   imagine for a moment the inconsolable grief of a jewish mother 
 whose baby have be butcher to death could you imagine anything more 
 callous and cruel than tell that grieve mother you have it come 
 you and your people bring the terror upon yourself 
   those be the shocking sentiment of the new york city democratic 
 socialists of america nyc dsa which waste no time in hold a hate 
 rally romanticize the terrorism of hamas as ` ` resistance.&#x27;&#x27 
   the dsa be hardly alone in blame the victim of terrorism rather 
 than the terrorist themselves 
   something be rotten in the state of america when the institutional 
 leader in our country can not condemn the cold blooded murder of 
 israeli child and civilian with moral clarity must ask what 
 kind of society be we become 
   what do the silence and indifference and cowardice from these so- 
 call leader tell we about the depth of anti semitism in america and 
 the reckoning require 
   the time have come to confront not only the symptom but the disease 
 a democratic socialist industrial complex that indoctrinate young 
 americans with an anti israel hatred so virulent that it render they 
 indifferent to the deadly massacre of jews since the holocaust 
   anti israel extremism which have be give a veneer of mainstream 
 respectability in law school and legislature be aid and abet by 
 the sheer spinelessness of so call ` ` leaders&#x27;&#x27;--from public official 
 to the president of college and university 
   day of silence be often follow by word of cowardice if there 
 be any word at all 
   northwestern university for example say it have no plan to ` ` put 
 out a statement officially state a university position.&#x27;&#x27 imagine 
 that a university that can not be bother to take a position on a 
 pogrom against jews have we learn nothing from the long and ugly 
 history of anti semitism 
   there be nothing accidental about the disregard for israeli life that 
 reveal itself in the wake of oct. the dehumanization of israeli 
 victim follow inevitably from the hyperbolic and systematic 
 demonization of israel itself 
   anti israel hate and hysteria have be allow to fester freely in 
 academia social medium the political arena and elsewhere it have be 
 propagate by astroturf activist and academic amplify by their 
 enabler in elect office and subsidize by government and civil 
 society 
   when people be make to believe the most dangerous lie about 
 israel that israel be the root of all evil on earth that it be a 
 ` ` year occupation&#x27;&#x27 that must be wipe off the map from the ` ` river 
 to the sea&#x27;&#x27 that israelis be not civilian but settler who can be 
 fairly target for ` ` resistance&#x27;&#x27 that israelis be commit 
 genocide and ethnic cleansing against the palestinians and harvesting 
 their organ and use the blood of their child that israel be 
 always the aggressor and hamas always the resister when you tell so 
 many lie and incite so much hate what do you think will happen 
   how do you think the believer internalize these lie will respond 
 to the savage slaughter of israelis this be a moral monstrosity make 
 in america and that america must unmake 
   the anti israel hate increasingly possess the american mind be a 
 demon that must be exorcise from our body politic for america can not 
 long remain a decent society if the next generation of americans be 
 make to be indifferent to the barbaric butchering of israeli civilian 
 and child 
   i for stand with israel as it seek to defend itself despite 
 the profound pain of the present israel will emerge from it all well 
 and strong than ever before 
   it will outlive the pernicious lie and the dangerous demagogue who 
 tell they it will outlive the extremism of the dsa and bds it will 
 outlive the terrorism of iran and its proxy hamas and hezbollah 
   israel will live on for the next year and beyond resilience be 
 the dna and destiny of the jewish people and the jewish state it 
 always have be and always will be i be as certain of that as i be of 
 anything the jewish nation live on be yisrael chai
