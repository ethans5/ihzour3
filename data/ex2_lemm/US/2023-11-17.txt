                               of minnesota 

                     in the house of representative 

                        tuesday november 

   ms. mccollum mr. chair i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 
 the labor health and human services education and related agencies 
 appropriations act the bill before we today be unprecedented in many 
 unfortunate way this bill make devastating cut across some of our 
 most vital government agency it decimate education spending 
 abandon low income worker and college student stifle medical 
 innovation and harm women&#x27;s health 
   this bill be pull from consideration on the house floor because 
 republicans do not have the support within their own conference to pass 
 this legislation it be another example in a long line of 
 appropriations failure by house republican leadership where there have 
 be no effort to find middle ground and find a bipartisan path 
 forward 
   let i begin with house republicans&#x27 unilateral decision to skip the 
 full committee markup for this bill and for the commerce justice 
 science appropriations act house democrats be deny the opportunity 
 to debate amend and mark up h.r. in committee this bill be so 
 deeply unpopular that republican appropriator do not want to go on 
 the record in committee in support of its deep cut to our nation&#x27;s 
 education workforce development and public health funding 
   not only have house republicans deviate from the longstanding 
 committee process but they have take the unheard of step of add 
 partisan rider to the bill and report in advance of consideration on 
 the house floor democratic appropriator have no say in their 
 inclusion in fact we only see these change once they have be make 
 public the report be not amendable on the house floor so there be no 
 recourse in challenge any of these new alteration beyond demand 
 they be remove in the conference process with the senate 
   now let&#x27;s talk about some of the policy decision within h.r. 
 start with the astounding percent cut to the department of 
 education this bill decimate support for child in k-12 elementary 
 school and early childhood education include an percent cut to 
 title i that be mean to help the most vulnerable student and school 
 district in our country 
   i have hear from my constituent teacher principal 
 paraprofessional parent and student that we be face a crisis 
 in our classroom this bill do not address the teacher shortage or 
 the extensive learning loss occur in our school post covid and 
 this bill do not help make college more affordable 
   instead this bill make devastating cut to the bedrock of american 
 education leave our teacher out in the cold without sufficient 
 resource and eliminate opportunity for student to access need- 
 base financial aid for their postsecondary education this bill also 
 eliminate all funding to the corporation for public broadcasting 
 include their educational programming for young child ready to 
 learn 
   in addition to education spending cut house republicans have also 
 take aim at workforce development this bill eliminate fund for 
 the federal work study youth job training and adult job training 
 program effectively deny job and employment training service to 
 americans who face barrier to find a good pay job house 
 republicans also cut $ from worker protection agency like 
 osha put hardworke americans at risk at home in minnesota and 
 across the country 
   this bill hurt the national institutes of health by cut $ 
 from their topline budget which will stymy medical innovation 
 it make a $ cut to the national institute of mental health 
 at a time when our country be face a mental health crisis the bill 
 also contain major cut to the national cancer institute hurt our 
 research and treatment capability for those with cancer here in 
 america and around the world 
   unsurprisingly this bill also take aim at women&#x27;s health by cut 
 program that support maternal and child health eliminate program 
 that provide access to health service and contraception and add 
 numerous poison pill rider that far strip a women&#x27;s right to make 
 medical decision about her own 

 page e1115 

 body with her doctor h.r. prohibit funding to planned 
 parenthood eliminate funding for title x family planning and make a 
 $ cut to the maternal and child health block grant 
   support our child and family be the bare minimum of what our 
 government should do for its people this bill fail at every level to 
 do so instead of reevaluate their extreme funding bill and work 
 together with democrats to create legislation that will improve 
 american life house republicans be distract by their own chaos and 
 be intent on placate the most extreme in their caucus for these 
 reason and more i must oppose h.r. and i urge my colleague to 
 do the same

   mr. case mr. speaker i rise today to urge my house colleague to 
 join in protect our world&#x27;s fragile coral reef ecosystem by 
 restrict international import of protect ornamental reef fish and 
 coral specie collect by destructive and unsustainable practice 
   our ocean be indispensable to life on our planet not only to our 
 global environment but to the billion that be directly or indirectly 
 reliant on its resource our ocean in turn rely on the health and 
 diversity of our coral reef some of our most diverse ecosystem with 
 nearly percent of the ocean&#x27;s fish dependent on coral reef for 
 shelter food and reproduction and our coral reef be interdependent 
 with healthy diverse and sustainable marine flora and fauna 
   among these be prize ornamental reef fish and coral specie highly 
 value by collector while it be possible to collect they at 
 sustainable level which do not harm the coral reef or broad marine 
 ecosystem high demand lead too often to unsustainable and destructive 
 collection practice such as overcollection of specie overall 
 overcollection of young specimen collection through reef dredging 
 gill net explosive or poison and harm to specimen lead to 
 excessive death in transit most of the collection occur 
 internationally where most of our world&#x27;s coral reef be find in 
 country such as in southeast asia which do not have strong 
 regulation or enforcement regimen against unsustainable or destructive 
 practice 
   as the large importer of ornamental reef fish our country have both 
 responsibility for create the demand that lead to such practice 
 and the opportunity to channel that demand to sustainable collection 
 the saving natural ecosystems and marine organisms act would do so by 
 prohibit the import into our country of protect reef specie take 
 use unsustainable or destructive practice the enforcement mechanism 
 would be administrative certification in conjunction with cooperate 
 collect country where possible that ornamental reef fish and 
 specie to be import into our country be collect without 
 follow those practice 
   i ask for my colleagues&#x27 support of this bill which be piece of a 
 much large effort to save our ocean from their own bad enemy we
