  unwinnable race congress&#x27;s responsibility to prevent a nuclear arms 
                                   race 

                                  
                                 

                           hon john garamendi 

                              of california 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday june 

   mr. garamendi mr. speaker i rise today to call on this body to 
 fulfill its responsibility in address an existential challenge 
 face our nation for decade nuclear weapon have threaten the 
 safety of our country and our planet today as nation re arm and 
 competition re emerge we run the risk of repeat our past mistake 
 and enter a new cold war a nuclear arm race be well underway and 
 it pose an existential threat to all this congress must stand up and 
 stop the escalatory spiral before it&#x27;s too late 
   it&#x27;s well past time for our voice the voice of restraint and risk 
 reduction to be hear in the nuclear arm debate the united states 
 the russian federation and the people&#x27;s republic of china be lock 
 into an extraordinarily dangerous nuclear arm race all 
 country be rapidly increase their nuclear firepower with new and 
 more capable bomb more long range missile new stealth delivery 
 system bomber and submarine and as tension heighten all of this 
 be dependent on the new field of warfare space all country 
 depend upon their space asset to observe detect threat and 
 communicate the command to act 
   we must cut through the rhetoric of fear and doomsaye that 
 dominate our nuclear policy debate we can no long allow the 
 thoughtful calm voice to be drown out by fearmongere cry we 
 must rise above the noise instead of develop cost effective 
 military system that provide security while defuse tension we have 
 fall into the fallacy that more missile make we more secure nothing 
 could be far from the truth 
   today we must call out the failure of our current approach to 
 nuclear modernization and demand that we treat arm control and de- 
 escalation with the same dedication and focus we give to our nuclear 
 weapon development it be long past time to develop a strategy that 
 set priority recognize limitation and strive for a safe 
 future 
   it be important to step back and consider the history and broad 
 context of nuclear weapon and congressional involvement since their 
 development almost year ago the destructive capability of nuclear 
 weapon have terrify and shock but also lead government to pursue 
 their own arsenal and develop the capacity to destroy our civilization 
 multiple time over government have justify expand stockpile 
 with convoluted theory of nuclear deterrence that often defy common 
 sense 
   it wasn&#x27;t until arm control program and treaty be establish 
 that russia and the united states de escalate this spiral of 
 stockpile bomb through decade progress be make the number 
 of deployed and exist nuclear bomb be reduce and even the most 
 adversarial country agree that ` ` a nuclear war can not be win and 
 must never be fought.&#x27;&#x27 yet despite this understanding we continue to 
 maintain and modernize our arsenal with a belief that these weapon 
 dissuade other from employ theirs the threat of nuclear conflict 
 remain and with it life on our planet end or become 
 dramatically change 
   it would be useful to remind people of the arm control agreement 
 and the leader that negotiate they i&#x27;m sure that some of my 
 congressional nuclear warrior would be surprised to see that their 
 most ardent national security hero negotiate the reduction and 
 control 
   i recognize the nuclear threat pose by country like north korea 
 russia and china i do not deny the challenge security environment 
 we face i be fully aware of the taiwan china threat as well as 
 china&#x27;s military buildup and south china sea expansion the north 
 korean regime be dangerous and could precipitate a conflict at any 
 moment i condemn russia&#x27;s unprovoked invasion of ukraine 
 irresponsible nuclear saber rattle and dangerous nuclear exercise 
   despite these serious threat we must be wise in prepare our 
 defense and response aggression should not be our thought when 
 face with threat uncertainty and misunderstanding therefore i 
 strongly support effort by the u.s. and chinese government to engage 
 in meaningful dialogue that result in specific concrete action to 
 reduce the risk of miscommunication or escalation 
   as we navigate these complex geopolitical landscape it be 
 imperative that we pause and reflect on the strategy guide our 
 nuclear policy strategy must be more than a word throw on top of 
 grandiose statement true strategy be make the hard choice to align 
 our country&#x27;s limited resource with our unlimited aspiration 
   the great problem face our nuclear strategy today be that we 
 fail to realistically consider that balance revisit our assumption 
 adjust course when program fail and figure out new path forward 
 once approve weapon program persist even when they nearly double 
 and triple their budget no stop and say ` ` enough.&#x27;&#x27 
   too often we allow these debate to be drive by military 
 calculation and how ` ` experts&#x27;&#x27 would fight a nuclear war but we must 
 not forget that in a democratic society the military be the extension 
 of the political and not the other way around when it come to 
 program and strategy that threaten our very existence we as a 
 whole society must decide what cost we should bear and what risk we 
 must take our nuclear strategy must be balanced and rational allow 
 for deterrence and defensive action while encourage collaboration 
 for a more peaceful future 
   we in congress be part of the problem we have buy into the 
 assumption that more nuclear weapon will make we safe ever grow 
 cost reflect the irrationality that have plague our nuclear policy in 
 the name of ` ` modernization,&#x27;&#x27 we&#x27;ve take on hundred of billion of 
 dollar of additional spending and the nuclear account grow without 
 question or scrutiny 
   an example be the nuclear modernization effort the political price 
 tag for new start be the modernization of all leg of america&#x27;s 
 nuclear triad proponent tell we the multi dollar cost be 
 necessary to ensure that we continue to have a viable deterrent today 
 we can and should debate whether every part of modernization be cost- 
 effective and necessary for deterrence we must also fully understand 
 the reason for the massive growth in the cost of all these program 
   let&#x27;s turn to the new sentinel icbm which be destine to replace the 
 minuteman iii it have incur an egregious percent cost overrun 
 make the program&#x27;s cost almost percent high than the air 
 force&#x27;s initial estimate this have trigger a critical nunn- 
 mccurdy cost overrun force a stop and a full statutory review 
 despite the new estimate cost of $ there be loud and 
 clear reflexive signal that the pentagon and congress intend to plow 
 ahead no matter the cost or the necessity ` ` we&#x27;ll do whatever be 
 necessary.&#x27;&#x27 
   while this may be convenient the law require a complete and full 
 review that address critical step the program be essential 
 to national security there be no alternative to the program that 
 will provide acceptable capability the new cost estimate have 
 be determine to be reasonable the program be a high priority 
 than program whose funding will be reduce to cover the increase cost 
 of this program and the management structure be sufficient to 
 control additional cost growth it be imperative that the pentagon 
 conduct a thorough examination to assess the necessity and feasibility 
 of continue the program in its current state equally necessary be 
 that congress engage in a full debate to assess the pentagon&#x27;s 
 rationale without public pressure it be doubtful that any hearing 
 will occur and that&#x27;s why our congressional nuclear weapons and arm 
 control working group will hold its own hearing on july 
   for year congress have dictate in the annual ndaa that the u.s. 
 maintain a minimum of icbm a number found not on logic but 
 because ` ` that&#x27;s what we have always had.&#x27;&#x27 the number of ground base 
 icbm should not be set by the number of exist concrete silos but in 
 the honest analysis of nuclear strategy such a review must consider 
 the risk of a catastrophic mistake inherent in the sentinel program in 
 the event of an attack it be assume that the target be the 
 well know location of the icbms it&#x27;s a use it or lose it situation 
 therefore a ` ` launch on warning&#x27;&#x27 be the operational imperative the 
 president have only minute to decide if the attack be real 
   if the nuclear program be for deterrence then the submarine 
 airplane and their missile offer sufficient firepower to dissuade an 
 adversary these system have the benefit of stealth and the president 
 have the time to gather all information and then decide to use the 
 nuclear response if that weren&#x27;t enough we also have ample 
 conventional weapon capability to deter potential adversary 
   however the sentinel program be not the only problem the hidden 
 cost of ground- 

 page e619 

 base icbm modernization be find in unexpected and little notice 
 place like the ` ` energy and water&#x27;&#x27 appropriation bill which would 
 spend $ for ` ` weapons activities,&#x27;&#x27 a $ increase 
 from the previous year so what be the $ for this year 
 the department of energy nnsa request a $ down payment for 
 the production of ` ` plutonium pits,&#x27;&#x27 which be the hollow plutonium 
 shell use to trigger the nuclear reaction on its own this number be 
 astonishingly high but it doesn&#x27;t include the anticipate $ 
 to build the production facility in los alamos and the facility 
 at savannah river which alone have a project total project cost of 
 $ nearly time the initial estimate cost for 
 construction it will be the most expensive building in america and 
 there be the $ request for stockpile sustainment the $ 
 dollar for the sentinel warhead development at lawrence lab 
 which have grow by percent and the untold cost of the other 
 warhead and bomb that support the other nuclear modernization 
 program 
   even proponent of modernize nuclear program should be concern 
 about the high cost the january gao report find that the nnsa 
 have not develop a comprehensive schedule or cost estimate and have not 
 identify all necessary activity or milestone to achieve the 
 require pit per year production capacity and why do we need to 
 produce pit per year when america already have over plutonium 
 pit in storage have anyone study the potential of repurpose these 
 pit for the new bomb the bottom line be this senior official at 
 the nnsa admit they won&#x27;t meet deadline and have no idea what the 
 ultimate cost will be 
   i have try to force common sense reform to well estimate cost 
 for example i offer a straightforward amendment that would change 
 the current law require pit per year to a low number that 
 represent the realistic number of plutonium pit our country need and 
 can feasibly produce to some this be see as an ` ` extreme radical 
 position,&#x27;&#x27 and my proposal be vote down time and time again i have 
 be deny the opportunity to bring important nuclear matter to the 
 floor for debate 
   across the nuclear enterprise cost be soar fear be grow 
 and it remain unclear what goal we be achieve yet amidst soar 
 cost and escalating risk it&#x27;s imperative to reassess our nuclear 
 priority invest more of the modernization budget into diplomacy 
 arm control and education could yield far reach benefit 
 foster a strong and more secure nation congress must fulfill its 
 duty to allocate taxpayer fund responsibly avoid excessive 
 expense on wasteful nuclear program that do little to enhance genuine 
 security maintain a ` ` safe secure and effective deterrent&#x27;&#x27 do 
 not necessitate these costly modernization plan especially give the 
 press need in other area critical to national strength and 
 stability 
   the significance of arm control can not be overstate prioritize 
 de escalation isn&#x27;t just an idealistic notion it&#x27;s a necessity arm 
 race can not be win when we attempt to outpace our adversary in 
 weapon development they inevitably respond in kind drain our 
 limited resource and foster international instability as fear 
 predominate and the world&#x27;s most devastating weapon become a more 
 likely option 
   the critical role of arm control in preserve global stability and 
 security be evident from history&#x27;s many close call we can&#x27;t afford to 
 wait for another cuban missile crisis to recognize the danger of 
 miscommunication and the failure to engage in dialogue 
   only a few lonely congressional voice have join the clarion call 
 put forth by the arms control association ploughshares council for a 
 livable world union of concerned scientists friends committee on 
 national legislation nuclear threat initiative and other well know 
 arm control organization year after year fund proposal and 
 resolution to support non proliferation nuclear fissile material 
 control and verification and weapon negotiation have be make to 
 draw attention to the importance of arm control like sisyphus push 
 the boulder up the hill it be often thankless work fighting and 
 clawing for progress only to see it roll back down again as have 
 happen in the intermediate range nuclear missile treaty new start 
 and the iran nuclear agreement but the work could not be more 
 important unlike that greek myth i do believe that we can get the 
 boulder to the top of the hill and develop robust arm control regime 
 that will help we all to avoid an existential threat 
   there be key pillar in this endeavor knowledge of the 
 destructive power of nuclear weapon and an understanding of their role 
 in modern warfare the library be full of study on nuclear war 
 deterrence the risk of misunderstanding compelling argument for 
 risk reduction and the value of arm control we can not forget the 
 horror that nuclear weapon would inflict if they be ever use 
 again this work can not be understate it&#x27;s be year since 
 hiroshima and nagasaki and year since the movie ` ` the day after&#x27;&#x27 
 air show americans and their leadership just how terrible such an 
 event would be it be a hard truth but we must face we can&#x27;t 
 allow nuclear weapon rhetoric to be divorce from the very real 
 consequence of their use 
   secondly encourage dialogue and foster open communication 
 channel be essential while it may appear impossible to have any arm 
 control negotiation with russia as it conduct its war of aggression 
 in ukraine it be important to remember that many of the previous arm 
 treaty with russia begin at the moment of maximum international 
 tension the recent dialogue with china&#x27;s political and military 
 leader be encouraging we should accept china&#x27;s offer to discuss ` ` no 
 use&#x27;&#x27 policy we don&#x27;t know where the discussion may lead but 
 it&#x27;s an opening 
   lastly garner political support be crucial non profit and 
 advocacy group have lay the groundwork now we must amplify their 
 effort and call on congress to act for too long our focus on arm 
 control have wan and member of congress have pay too little focus 
   this be the moment to redouble our effort in a world mark by 
 uncertainty and grow competition build bridge and foster 
 understanding be more critical than ever however this effort must 
 start at home inevitably congress must reconcile our infinite desire 
 with our limited mean that mean make hard decision about how and 
 where to spend taxpayer dollar to achieve real security hundred of 
 billion of dollar and year have be spend in the modernization 
 of america&#x27;s nuclear weapon program and it have yield a three- 
 nation nuclear arm and space race be we more secure 
   the sentinel icbm program now estimate to be $ breach 
 the cost escalation limit of the nunn mccurdy law the pentagon and 
 congress must now justify the continuation of the program congress and 
 the american public must not waste this pivotal moment to study the 
 reality of the nuclear weapon arm race and make a decision to shift 
 course it&#x27;s past time to maximize our effort to negotiate an end to 
 the race and seek path to reduce nuclear arm and the associate 
 existential threat 
   we face real challenge in this world but too often hyperbole and 
 fear be be use to drive our decision making competition need not 
 mean hostility it be time we return to reason and rationality 
 together we must confront the challenge before we not by build 
 ever more dangerous weapon but by place the same priority on 
 effective arm control and risk reduction measure that we currently 
 place on modernization we may face challenge but we still have the 
 choice of which future we will pursue we know the risk we know the 
 danger that modernization and the inevitable arm race could hold 
 but that&#x27;s why it be so important we redouble our effort toward make 
 de escalation real let we take this moment this opportunity to 
 engage in a meaningful dialogue and choose the path towards a safe and 
 more world
