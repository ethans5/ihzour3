                          tuesday may 

   mrs. beatty mr. speaker today i stand with my congressional black 
 caucus colleague to address the urgent challenge face by the black 
 community in mental health during mental health awareness month and to 
 call we to advocacy awareness and action 
   while black adult experience mental illness at similar rate to the 
 general population they face different outcome between and 
 black individual see significant increase in suicide rate 
 while the share of drug overdose death among majority individual 
 decrease between and share of these death among black 
 people rise account for their disproportionate share of drug 
 overdose death 
   the barrier to mental wellness for black americans be complex they 
 include but be not limit to mental health treatment stigma limited 
 access to culturally competent care or care at all and the endure 
 effect of racism and racial trauma historical and ongoing racism 
 contribute to high poverty rate increase incarceration and 
 limited access to healthcare and housing as well as more subtle form 
 of discrimination like microaggression all of which deeply impact 
 black mental health 
   despite comparable rate of mental health condition only percent 
 of black individual have receive mental health service due to 
 systemic barrier and stigma approximately percent of black people 
 lack health insurance significantly affect their access to care 
 and when care be seek it often occur in emergency department 
 rather than from mental health specialist the scarcity of black 
 professional in the mental health field exacerbate this gap in health 
 care access understanding and trust 
   our response must include advocacy awareness and action 
   we must push for policy that dismantle systemic barrier to mental 
 health care and societal driver of black mental health challenge we 
 must pursue initiative that focus on education and destigmatization so 
 more black individual seek help without fear of judgment and we must 
 act we must promote diversity equity and inclusion training in 
 medical education and provider training to mitigate provider bias and 
 care inequality and we must continue to address the endure effect 
 of racism and racial trauma 
   mental health be a right not a privilege and it be our duty to 
 ensure that this right be uphold for every community especially those 
 that have be marginalize for far too long let we use national 
 mental health and wellness month to commit to meaningful change 
 together we can foster healing understanding and resilience for all 
 americans
