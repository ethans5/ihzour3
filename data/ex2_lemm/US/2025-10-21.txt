                        tuesday october 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the federal government 
 advertising equity accountability act which would require all federal 
 agency to include in their annual budget request to congress the 
 amount they spend on advertising contract with small disadvantaged 
 business sdb and business own by minority and woman federal 
 agency would be require to provide prior and project total 
 expenditure for such contract at my request the committee on 
 appropriations have require many federal agency to provide such 
 information each of the last several year but this bill would codify 
 this requirement and apply it to all federal agency 
   in the government accountability office gao examine spending 
 on advertising contract with minority own business by federal 
 agency the department of defense the department of the treasury 
 the department of health and human services the department of the 
 interior and the national aeronautics and space administration and 
 find that only percent of the $ available for 
 advertising contract go to minority own business in light of 
 these concern finding i along with several other members of 
 congress send letter to gao in and request update 
 information on the amount of federal advertising dollar spend with 
 sdb and business own by minority and woman in and 
 gao issue report on the amount of federal advertising dollar spend 
 with sdb and business own by minority and woman the report 
 reveal that only percent of federal advertising contract 
 obligation go to sdb and business own by minority and woman 
 the federal government be of the large advertiser in the united 
 states and it have an obligation to ensure equitable access to its 
 contract for sdb and business own by minority and woman gao&#x27;s 
 finding demonstrate that there be still much progress to be make 

 page e989 

   the regular collection of information on federal advertising 
 contract with sdb and business own by woman and minority be 
 essential to bridge the gap between what current statistic show and 
 a more inclusive advertising landscape this bill would help achieve 
 this goal while also promote transparency and encourage federal 
 agency to strive to reach minority who often receive the news from 
 small medium outlet that serve community of color the requirement 
 that agency submit prior and project information on the amount of 
 advertising dollar spend with sdb and business own by minority 
 and woman would allow federal agency to evaluate their progress the 
 regular collection of this information would also demonstrate that the 
 promotion of equity in advertising and in all area of government be a 
 continuous effort and be important to the mission of every federal 
 agency 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
