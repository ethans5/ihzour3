                          wednesday may 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in opposition to h.r. the 
 equal representation act 
   h.r. would mandate that the decennial census include a 
 citizenship question and that the apportionment of u.s. 
 representative be base solely on a count of american citizen this 
 be yet another attempt by house republicans to advance their anti- 
 immigrant political agenda by sabotage the census which be require 
 by the u.s. constitution 

 page e497 

 this bill would deliberately undermine the census&#x27;s ability to reach 
 chronically undercounted population the result impact would be to 
 make future censuses more costly and lead to inaccurate datum that will 
 have wide range implication for minnesota and our nation 
   accurate census datum be necessary for determine the number of u.s. 
 house of representatives seat and electoral college vote allocate to 
 each state as well as the share of trillion of dollar in federal 
 funding each state receive for minnesota an inaccurate count could 
 result in the loss of representation in congress and less federal 
 funding for essential service cause unnecessary harm to our 
 community this bill threaten the accuracy of the census and 
 diminish public trust it would lead to manipulation of election map 
 and the hindering of the fair allocation of federal resource 
   i will always fight for an accurate census that be consistent with 
 our american value and i will always work to ensure minnesotans 
 receive the federal funding representation in congress and electoral 
 vote they deserve

                               of minnesota 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday may 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker the assistance to fire grants afg and 
 staffing for adequate fire and emergency response safer grant 
 provide essential resource to fire department around the country 
 since their authorization in these grant program have provide 
 more than $ in funding nationwide to community fire 
 department ensure that they be prepare for whatever challenge 
 they might face it be essential congress fund these program as local 
 government often lack the resource to invest in new firefighting 
 equipment and to cover the cost of hire and train new 
 firefighter 
   i vote in support of the house amendment to s. the fire grants 
 and safety act of because we must continue to deliver these vital 
 fund to our community however i be disappointed that house 
 republicans amend this legislation to add an unrelated bill s. 
 -the accelerating deployment of versatile advanced nuclear for 
 clean energy advance act the reauthorization of the afg and safer 
 grant should not have be package with a bill to accelerate nuclear 
 energy deployment which be a complex issue that deserve its own 
 debate and vote i would have prefer to vote on these unrelated 
 issue separately 
   i will continue to support our local fire department and ensure that 
 they have access to the federal resource they need to keep our 
 community safe
