                               of minnesota 

                     in the house of representative 

                       wednesday september 

   ms. mccollum mr. chair minnesotans be feel the heat literally 
 the twin cities have experience day over degree this summer 
 and wildfire smoke have result in air quality alert near the 
 record of day in this be not a fluke it&#x27;s a sign of a 
 worsen climate crisis that threaten our life health safety and 
 economic security 
   instead of invest in solution to this crisis the republican 
 majority in congress be advance legislation that would raise energy 
 cost for american household and business make we less competitive 
 and weaken our national security 
   last month the house appropriations committee pass h.r. the 
 fiscal year energy and water appropriations bill as the only 
 minnesotan on the appropriations committee i will vote against 
 advance this bill its cut will harm minnesota and our nation 
   our global competitor like china be invest hundred of billion 
 of dollar in clean energy development but republicans be choose to 
 cut u.s. investment that create high wage job drive innovation and 
 low energy bill for americans republicans&#x27 bill slash energy 
 efficiency and renewable energy program at the department of energy by 
 $ a staggering percent cut for minnesota this cut 
 mean we&#x27;ll lose over $ in federal funding if republicans&#x27 
 energy and water bill become law 
   if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough republicans on the appropriations 
 committee vote for a percent cut to the weatherization assistance 
 program which help low income household lower their utility bill by 
 improve home energy efficiency this program help roughly 
 minnesotans weatherize their home each year save family about 
 $ annually on their energy bill while most u.s. household spend 
 percent of their income on energy cost low income household often 
 spend percent or more under the maga republican plan many senior 
 citizen and family would be force to choose between buy 
 grocery or cool their home during record break heat 
   it could get even bad for these family president donald trump 
 have propose eliminate funding for the low income home energy 
 assistance program liheap trump call liheap ` ` unnecessary,&#x27;&#x27 but 
 for thousand of minnesotans it be a lifeline that help to keep the 
 heat on during our brutal winter 
   as house republicans&#x27 energy and water bill increase minnesotans&#x27 
 energy cost their funding cut will have a chilling effect on clean- 
 energy job a sector that have be grow time fast than 
 minnesota&#x27;s overall job growth more than minnesotans work in 
 clean energy and more than of they work in energy efficiency 
 more than local contractor alone work on project directly 
 support by the weatherization assistance program 
   since take office trump have be jeopardize clean energy job in 
 minnesota by terminate clean energy incentive in his so call ` ` 
 big beautiful bill,&#x27;&#x27 cancel grant and illegally withhold fund 
 from state local and tribal government these action be stall 
 clean energy project and eliminate high wage job 
   the trump administration be also attack workforce development for 
 clean energy in may the department of labor shut down job corps 
 close the door of the hubert h. humphrey job corps center in st. 
 paul for year job corps provide job training education and 
 housing for thousand of low income at risk youth prepare 
 minnesota&#x27;s workforce to meet the challenge and opportunity of the 
 century include job in renewable energy and efficiency 
   we can not afford to abandon these investment during a worsen 
 climate crisis american family be already struggle with high 
 energy bill but the need to develop our own homegrown clean and 
 sustainable energy isn&#x27;t just a matter of economic security it&#x27;s also 
 about our national security 
   the department of defense consider climate change to be a top 
 national security concern climate change be make nation around the 
 world more unstable and less safe it&#x27;s also hurt our military 
 readiness here at home with sea level rise and extreme weather 
 flood our basis permafrost thaw be make alaskan runway unusable 
 radar station be at risk of fall into the sea 
   mr. chair we don&#x27;t have the luxury of ignore the very real effect 
 of climate change happen around we especially when they&#x27;re 
 affect our life and livelihood and our national security future 
 generation will pay the high cost of republicans&#x27 failure to act 
   as a minnesota representative i will fight to defend these critical 
 investment because minnesotans deserve well the child deserve 
 well
