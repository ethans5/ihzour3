                         tuesday march 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce a bill to clarify certain 
 due process right of federal employee serve in sensitive position 
 this bill would overturn an unprecedented federal court decision 
 kaplan v. conyers and mspb that strip many federal employee of the 
 light to independent review of an agency decision remove they from 
 their job on ground of ineligibility the case be bring by 
 department of defense dod employee rhonda conyers an accounting 
 technician and devon northover a commissary management specialist 
 who be permanently demote and suspend from their job after they 
 be find to be no long eligible to serve in noncritical sensitive 
 position in the supreme court decline to hear the case which 
 allow the decision to stand this bill be cosponsor by 
 representative andre carson 
   specifically the decision prevent federal employee who be 
 designate as ` ` noncritical sensitive&#x27;&#x27 from appeal to the merit 
 systems protection board if they be remove from their job 
 noncritical sensitive job include those that do not have access to 
 classified information the decision affect at least dod 
 employee who be designate as noncritical sensitive even more 
 concern be that most federal employee could potentially lose the 
 right to an independent review of an agency&#x27;s decision because of a 
 rule issue by the office of personnel management and the office of the 
 director of national intelligence that permit agency head to 
 designate most job in the federal government as noncritical sensitive 
 which go into effect in july 
   the decision undercut title section of the civil service 
 act which ensure due process right for federal worker as require 
 by the constitution strip employee whose work do not involve 
 classified matter of the right to an independent review of an agency 
 decision that remove they from their job open entirely new avenue 
 for unreviewable arbitrary action or retaliation by an agency head 
 this bill would stop the use of ` ` national security&#x27;&#x27 to undo a vital 
 component of civil service protection and of due process 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
