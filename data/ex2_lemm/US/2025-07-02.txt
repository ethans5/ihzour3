   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in strong opposition to h. res 
 the condemn the violent june riot in los angeles 
 california it be deeply unfortunate that instead of work with 
 democrats on a bipartisan resolution to condemn violence republicans 
 have instead write a partisan resolution design to attack elect 
 official in california furthermore the resolution fail to recognize 
 the premature and escalatory deployment of the national guard and 
 active duty marines by president trump to los angeles 
   when the house of representatives pass a resolution regard 
 current event it should do its due diligence to cite the fact 
 unfortunately it be clear the republican majority have no interest in 
 accurately portray the protest in los angeles when they write h. 
 res instead the resolution perpetuate a false narrative about 
 democratic elect official in california h. res state that 
 local elect official do not adequately respond to the bad actor 
 and trouble doer these claim be patently false mayor karen bass of 
 los angeles implement a multi day curfew and surge law enforcement 
 resource to downtown los angeles to maintain control of the situation 
 this keep the situation contain to block of the downtown area 
   but even when the los angeles chief of police state that the 
 demonstration ` ` be nowhere near a level&#x27;&#x27 where the national guard 
 be need president trump disregard his opinion and take the 
 escalatory action of deploy member of the california national 
 guard to los angeles then on june the president deploy 
 active duty marine our active duty military have absolutely no legal 
 role in domestic law enforcement los angeles county have law 
 enforcement personnel who be well train in crowd control there be 
 no need for the national guard or the marines to be deploy by the 
 president and his decision set a dangerous precedent for the future 
   republicans have the opportunity to bring a resolution introduce by 
 my colleague representative barragan condemn violence and bad 
 actor and thank local law enforcement for their work instead 
 republicans choose to use the unrest in los angeles to play partisan 
 game and attack democrats in california 
   mr. speaker it be our duty as public servant to tell the truth we 
 should all stand for condemn violence de escalation of force and 
 the right to peacefully protest it be unfortunate that this resolution 
 walk away from these principle i can not support it
