 record my vote as present the reason for my vote be as follow 
   all act of sexual violence be horrific we should all be fight 
 to end it here at home and all over the world 
   so while this resolution rightly denounce any sexual commit by 
 hamas i be disturbed that it completely ignore and erase any sexual 
 abuse and violence commit by israeli force against palestinians 
 especially child 
   war crime can not justify more war crime we must stand up for 
 everyone&#x27;s safety and human right no matter their faith or ethnicity 
   there be numerous well document report of sexual violence 
 include rape commit by israeli force against palestinians in 
 their custody child detain and strip to their underwear in 
 public for the world to see 
   the un and human right group have raise alarm for year but 
 congress have never care 
   we all have a responsibility to denounce sexual violence in all 
 form regardless of who be responsible this resolution fall well 
 short of that responsibility 
   mr. speaker outreach be make to the sponsor of h. res on 
 several occasion to support the inclusion of palestinians who have be 
 victim of sexual violence into the resolution however the sponsor 
 deny add in any language that support the well document fact 
 that palestinians have face many atrocity similar to those describe 
 in the resolution sexual violence be abhorrent and must be fully 
 investigate and prosecute the intentional omission of palestinian 
 live experience in this resolution be dehumanizing and a disservice 
 to survivor everywhere
