 vulnerable resident i fully expect mokan goodwill to continue to 
 faithfully provide their service for as long as there be missourians 
 and kansans to accept they and i ask that we take a moment to reflect 
 on the organization&#x27;s profound impact 

 page e721 

   the history of mokan goodwill be the history of separate but 
 like minded organization eventually converge to make possible the 
 charitable institution we know today the found year ago

 organization for the city&#x27;s unhoused population the institute supply 
 food and shelter as well as monetary compensation in exchange for 
 complete work project this process serve to successfully provide 
 support employment and eventually self sufficiency for those who

 difference in the life of thousand of kansas citians but also 
 develop the city into the thrive metropolis we know today 
   the organization goodwill found in boston by reverend edgar 
 j. helms in be not unique to kansas city but be know 
 nationwide for its charitable work and pioneer philanthropy with 
 the charitable will of any good minister helms seek to improve the 
 living condition of impoverished immigrant he establish goodwill&#x27;s 
 trademark business model of collect donate good and sell they 
 for a modest profit which would be use to pay the worker who 
 prepare the good for sale helms make a habit of employ people who 
 be economically disadvantaged or have disability people who at the 
 time would likely be unable to find a job elsewhere it be a system 
 with similar value and mission as the helping hand institute both 
 organization not only provide relief to those who need it the most 
 but also seek the opportunity for upward social mobility the 
 opportunity to make the american dream which seem so elusive to so 
 many a reality 
   goodwill come to kansas city in in the form of a repair 
 shop at st. peter&#x27;s evangelical church on oak street it become clear 
 to both goodwill and the helping hand institute that their effort to 
 raise the city&#x27;s disadvantaged population into self sufficiency would 
 be more successful together in the merge to form the 
 helping hand of goodwill industries this name be change to goodwill 
 of western missouri and eastern kansas in to well reflect the 
 geographic scope of the organization thus create the mokan goodwill 
 that we know and love today

 greater kansas city their thrift store continue to operate under 
 reverend helms&#x27;s initial model create a valuable place of employment 
 while extend the opportunity to purchase low cost household good

 their client succeed in take the most crucial step towards become 
 self sufficient find a job goodwill understand the importance of

   mr. larson of connecticut mr. speaker i would like to include in 
 the record the following guest essay publish in the new york times 
 which my dear friend and prominent constituent ralph nader share 
 with i 

                 from the new york times june 

        we be israelis call on congress to disinvite netanyahu 

      by david harel tamir pardo talia sasson ehud barak aaron 
                     ciechanover and david grossman 

        the leader of the u.s. congress have invite prime 
      minister benjamin netanyahu of israel to address a joint 
      meeting of the senate and the house of representatives on 
      july normally we israelis would consider the invitation 
      recognition of our nations&#x27 share value and a welcome 
      gesture from our close friend and ally to whom we be 
      deeply and morally indebted 
        but congress have make a terrible mistake mr. netanyahu&#x27;s 
      appearance in washington will not represent the state of 
      israel and its citizen and it will reward his scandalous 
      and destructive conduct toward our country 
        we come from a variety of area of israeli society 
      science technology politic defense law and culture we 
      be thus in a good position to assess the overall effect of 
      mr. netanyahu&#x27;s government and like many we believe that he 
      be drive israel downhill at an alarming speed to the 
      extent that we may eventually lose the country we love 
        to date mr. netanyahu have fail to come up with a plan to 
      end the war in gaza and have be unable to gain the freedom 
      of score of hostage at the very least an invitation to 
      address congress should have be contingent upon resolve 
      these issue and in addition call for new election 
      in israel invite mr. netanyahu will reward his contempt 
      for u.s. effort to establish a peace plan allow more aid to 
      the beleaguered people of gaza and do a well job of spar 
      civilian time and again he have reject president biden&#x27;s 
      plan to remove hamas from power in gaza through the 
      establishment of a peacekeeping force such a move would very 
      likely bring in its wake a far broad regional alliance 
      include a vision to solve the israeli palestinian conflict 
      which be not only in israel&#x27;s interest but also in the 
      interest of both political party in the united states mr. 
      netanyahu constitute the main obstacle to these outcome 
        the man who will address congress next month have fail to 
      assume responsibility for the blunder that allow the hamas 
      assault initially blame security chief then quickly 
      backtracking and have yet to announce the establishment of a 
      direly need state commission of inquiry head by a supreme 
      court judge to look into the fiasco 
        despite the fierce fighting in gaza and daily casualty on 
      both side follow hamas&#x27;s terrible attack on oct. mr. 
      netanyahu continue to push forward with the authoritarian 
      remaking of israel as if nothing have change the israeli 
      police force under the command of the far right wing 
      security minister itamar ben gvir have crack down 
      violently on demonstrator the appointment of court judge 
      and a supreme court president remain on hold central 
      scientific and cultural institution continue to endure 
      governmental attempt at political control large sum of 
      money have be channel recklessly to the ultra orthodox 
      who by and large do not share the economic and security 
      burden of israel&#x27;s citizen especially by remain exempt 
      from serve in the military tuesday&#x27;s supreme court ruling 
      overturn the exemption be a step forward although the 
      practical impact be unclear give that mr. netanyahu have 
      propose enshrine the exemption in a law 
        above all many israelis be convince that mr. netanyahu 
      have obstruct propose deal with hamas that would have lead 
      to the release of the hostage in order to keep the war go 
      and thus avoid the inevitable political reckoning he will 
      face when it end 
        mr. ben gvir and bezalel smotrich the finance minister 
      whose support mr. netanyahu need to maintain his government 
      be strongly oppose to stop the war in gaza even for a 
      temporary truce they demand that the gaza strip be conquer 
      and fill with new settlement 
        for month now many of we have participate in nationwide 
      demonstration demand an immediate release of the 
      hostage an end to the war and immediate election poll of 
      israelis show that a majority want immediate election or 
      election right at the end of the war 
        a large portion of israelis have lose faith in mr. 
      netanyahu&#x27;s government he be cling to power thank to a 
      tenuous parliamentary majority that majority ignore the 
      plight of ten of thousand of israelis displace in the 
      south after the hamas attack and in the north because of 
      attack by hezbollah in lebanon and the family of the 
      hostage a powerful force now in israel 
        that&#x27;s where mr. netanyahu&#x27;s speech to congress fit in 
      with his political need no doubt it will be carefully stage- 
      manage to prop up his shaky hold on power and allow he to 
      boast to his constituent about america&#x27;s so call support 
      for his fail policy 
        his supporter in israel will be embolden by his 
      appearance in congress to insist that the war continue which 
      will far distance any deal to secure the release of the 
      hostage include several u.s. citizen 
        give mr. netanyahu the stage in washington will all but 
      dismiss the rage and pain of his people as express in the 
      demonstration throughout the country american lawmaker 
      should not let that happen they should ask mr. netanyahu to 
      stay home
