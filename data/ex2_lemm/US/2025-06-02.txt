   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the real id gender 
 requirement reform act which would repeal the requirement in the real 
 id act that real id compliant license include gender instead state 
 would decide whether to include gender on their respective real id- 
 compliant license i be pleased representative maxwell frost be co- 
 lead this bill 
   under this bill if a state include gender on its real id compliant 
 license the state must allow individual to change the gender 
 designation on their license through self attestation it would also 
 require state that include gender on their real id compliant license 
 to have a neutral or other designation gender field in addition to 
 male or female 
   under the real id act gender must be include on a license this can 
 be problematic for transgender and nonbinary individual i recognize 
 that some lgbtq+ individual do not want gender designation on 
 license at all while other do want gender designation so as to 
 express their identity i believe this bill strike the middle ground 
 while show congress&#x27 support for lgbtq+ individual 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
