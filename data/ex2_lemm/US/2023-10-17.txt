                        tuesday october 

   ms. norton mr. speaker pro tempore today i introduce the no 
 fencing at the united states capitol complex act which would prohibit 
 the installation of new permanent fencing on the ground of the united 
 states capitol complex i be pleased that senator chris van hollen be 
 introduce this bill in the senate 
   after the insurrectionist attack on the capitol on january 
 the capitol complex become an untraversable fortress surround by 
 frightening fence cap with barbed wire typical of authoritarian 
 regime although more need to be do to protect the capitol complex 
 the failure of capitol security leader to plan for the predictable and 
 openly announce attack on the capitol on january do not justify 
 close the complex to the public to whom it belong we can and must 
 maintain our commitment to security without sacrifice public access 
 by use the least restrictive mean necessary to address security 
   the january attack on the capitol which have little to do with 
 the lack of permanent fencing be the great intelligence and 
 security failure in the history of our nation&#x27;s capital there be 
 countless security failure on january that we can and must 
 address include take threat of extremist violence seriously at 
 an early stage close the capitol building ground during high- 
 profile and high threat event as be typically do but be not do 
 on january manpower build security and training permanent 
 fencing which be incredibly imprecise would not address those 
 security lapse it be more likely to keep out child jogger and 
 tourist than a coordinated attack on the capitol in fact it be a 
 form of security theater it would make the capitol ` ` look&#x27;&#x27 safe but 
 mask the lack of state of the art security measure that could prevent 
 attack in the future every threat to the capitol since january 
 have be stop by longstanding and new security measure and the 
 excellent work of the capitol police permanent fencing would not aid 
 the capitol police in stop threat but it would create an image of 
 authoritarianism secrecy and inaccessibility the capitol complex be 
 for all the american people and with proper security must remain 
 open to they 
   permanent fencing would send an un american message to the nation and 
 the world by transform our democracy from that be accessible 
 transparent and of the people to that be close off secretive and 
 fearful of its own citizen it would tell the world that the most 
 powerful nation must rely on crude barrier for safety instead of 
 state of the art intelligence and security protocol the capitol have 
 welcome amendment protest and demonstration for century 
 without become a fortress the openness of the capitol and our 
 democracy be our strength not a security weakness that need to be 
 root out any further consideration of permanent fencing be 
 desperate distasteful and disrespectful of our history and 
 institution 
   furthermore the capitol complex do not exist in a vacuum it be 
 immediately surround by residential neighborhood and local 
 business which form the heart of the district of columbia permanent 
 fencing would cause serious damage to the fabric of these community 
 after january these resident and business be more than 
 understanding as their neighborhood turn into militarized zone 
 they wait patiently as officer check their identification on their 
 walk home or take alternative route when they find block street 
 permanent fencing would infringe on their ability as well as the 
 general public&#x27;s ability to enjoy the public space that define our 
 nation&#x27;s capital 
   the distance between government and the people have grow with trust 
 in government at historic low instal permanent fencing at the
