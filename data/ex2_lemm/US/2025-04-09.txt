 u.s. forest service&#x27;s forest legacy program current law require that 
 only the federal or state government can hold conservation easement 
 purchase under the forest legacy program 
   allow state participate in the federal forest legacy program 
 the flexibility to partner with accredit nonprofit land trust will 
 help permanently conserve more land by work with private landowner 
 who want to have their land conserve but be wary of sell the 
 federal or state government an easement on their property expand 
 opportunity to conserve working forestland will benefit our rural 
 economy and encourage sustainable forest management practice that 
 help prevent wildfire 
   this bill maintain the integrity of the forest legacy program by 
 hold all accredit nonprofit land trust participate in the 
 program to the high possible standard in addition it implement 
 safeguard to prevent misuse of the program and allow the u.s. forest 
 service or state to reclaim easement if a land trust fall into 
 noncompliance with the program 
   by unlock new opportunity and funding for permanent land 
 conservation the ` ` forest legacy management flexibility act&#x27;&#x27 take a 
 critical step towards protect our country&#x27;s natural resource and 
 forest for future generation my colleague and i be honor to
