        introduction of the federal government advertising equity 
                            accountability act

                     in the house of representative 

                        tuesday november 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the federal government 
 advertising equity accountability act which would require all federal 
 agency to include in their annual budget request to congress the 
 amount they spend on advertising contract with small disadvantaged 
 business sdb and business own by minority and woman federal 
 agency would be require to provide prior and project total 
 expenditure for such contract at my request the committee on 
 appropriations have be require such information from many agency 
 for the last several year but this bill would codify this requirement 
 and apply it to all federal agency 
   in the government accountability office gao examine spending 
 on advertising contract with minority own business by 
 agency the department of defense the department of the treasury 
 the department of health and human services the department of the 
 interior and the national aeronautics and space administration and 
 find that only percent of the $ available for 
 advertising contract go to minority business in light of these 
 concern finding several member of congress and i send letter to 
 gao in april and june request update information on the 
 amount of federal advertising dollar spend with sdb and business 
 own by minority and woman a gao report release in july 
 show that in fiscal year only percent of the federal 
 government&#x27;s advertising contract obligation go to sdb and 
 business own by minority and woman gao agree last year to issue 
 an update report 
   the federal government be the large advertiser in the united 
 states and it have an obligation to ensure equitable access to its 
 contract for sdb and business own by minority and woman the 
 gao&#x27;s finding demonstrate that there be still much progress to be 
 make 
   the regular collection of information on federal advertising 
 contract with sdb and business own by woman and minority be 
 essential to bridge the gap between what current statistic show and 
 a more inclusive advertising landscape this bill would help achieve 
 this goal while also promote transparency and encourage federal 
 agency to strive to reach minority who often receive the news from 
 small medium outlet that serve community of color the requirement 
 that agency submit prior and project information on the amount of 
 advertising dollar spend with sdb and business own by minority 
 and woman would allow federal agency to evaluate their progress the 
 regular collection of this information would also demonstrate that the 
 promotion of equity in advertising and in all area of government be 
 a continuous effort and be important to the mission of every agency 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill

           no stolen trademarks honor in america act of

                              of california 

                     in the house of representative 

                        monday november 

   mr. issa mr. speaker recognize and safeguard intellectual 
 property right be a vital interest for the united states and a 
 critical component of our leadership which have historically champion 
 strong ip right 
   consistent and strong ip right ensure that business will seek to 
 innovate in the u.s. and enjoy the protection grant under our 
 constitution and law 
   it go without say that strong ip protection require that the 
 government respect ip ownership and the right of ip owner to control 
 who exercise their right 
   similarly obvious be that the government should not condone ip theft 
   that be exactly what have happen with the trademark steal by the 
 communist government of cuba 
   as if oppress and brutalize the cuban people be not enough the 
 castro regime also steal ip from legitimate owner during its vicious 
 takeover of cuba 
   this include steal valuable trademark such as ` ` havana club,&#x27;&#x27 
 from the arechabala family 
   the arechabala family for year invest their time and resource 
 build a world renowne brand for their rum only to have the 
 communists steal it along with the rest of their property include 
 all of their production facility 
   the castro regime then embark on decade of exploit that ip 
 manufacturing and export rum use the ` ` havana club&#x27;&#x27 trademark 
 they stole 
   the arechabala family never recover from what happen to they but 
 they transfer their rightful interest in their trademark to the 
 bacardi family and company in the u.s. 
   as a world leader when it come to ip right it should be clear that 
 the u.s. government would side with bacardi in a dispute between they 
 and the castro regime over these trademark 
   but in the u.s. patent and trademark office or uspto 
 recognize the cuban regime&#x27;s claim on the ` ` havana club&#x27;&#x27 trademark 
 even though it be steal by the cuban regime 
   that be why i introduce this bill which prohibit the executive 
 branch from recognize enforce or validate any trademark use in 
 connection with a business or asset that be confiscate without the 
 consent of the original owner or successor in interest 
   i be delighted to be join by my democratic colleague ms. 
 wasserman schultz of florida in introduce it and the bill have since 
 be cosponsor by other member from both party on the way to 
 be overwhelmingly approve by the judiciary committee on a 
 bipartisan basis 
   we all agree that the u.s. government should not reward those who 
 would steal and exploit trademark or any other ip without the 
 consent of the legitimate owner 
   allow cuba to propagate its misappropriation of ip also set a 
 harmful precedent for international ip protection 
   i urge my colleague on both side of the aisle to support this 
 legislation
