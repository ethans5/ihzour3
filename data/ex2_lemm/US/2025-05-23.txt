   ` ` let every nation know whether it wish we well or ill that we 
 shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any 
 friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of 
 liberty.&#x27;&#x27 
   president kennedy speak those word in but he could have say 
 they today or yesterday more than a declaration those word be a 
 promise weave into the fabric of american history uphold by the 
 generation of man and woman lay to rest around he to put it simply 
 president kennedy&#x27;s immortal word encapsulate memorial day perfectly 
   mr. speaker i rise today in recognition of memorial day a time to 
 commemorate the valor and sacrifice of the brave man and woman who 
 lay down their life in service to our nation to recall those who

   it be only fitting that on memorial day we find ourselves reflect 
 on those individual who so bravely and instinctively risk their all 
 in the face of severe danger i be remind of the poignant word of 
 navy veteran jack crawford who while serve aboard the uss yorktown

   ` ` there aren&#x27;t many thing you can take out of this planet but 
 you can take with you wherever you go consciousness of duty
