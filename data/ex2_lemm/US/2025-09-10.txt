 congressional district of which i represent in louisiana 
   from its year as a catholic high school in new orleans 
 through the mid-1960 st. augustine excel in major varsity 
 sport football basketball and track and field but the school 
 open under the administration of new orleans archbishop joseph 
 francis rummel be relegate to compete in the louisiana 
 interscholastic athletic and literary organization lialo during the 
 closing era of segregation 
   its principal josephite father robert grant want more for his 
 athlete he want they to compete against the city&#x27;s other catholic 
 school who be member of the louisiana high school athletic 
 association his attempt come in when father grant write to 
 the principal of the school jesuit st. aloysius holy cross 
 de la salle and redemptorist ask they to compete against st. aug on 
 an interscholastic sport level he think that would be possible 
 because the archdiocese of new orleans have already desegregate its 
 elementary school 
   no accept the invitation but there be reply by de la 
 salle principal christian brother cassian it be painfully blunt 
 ` ` father personally i be not to rush into situation which may 
 not be to my advantage and to those associate with i for year i 
 have refuse to play certain high school team on the basis that there 
 be nothing to gain by such competition this be how i feel about your 
 request to play de la salle time may change my attitude.&#x27;&#x27 
   mr. clarence jupiter who would go on to become a top administrator 
 at xavier university champion the cause by ask why st. augustine 
 and xavier preparatory which compete in major boys&#x27 sport be not 
 allow to play their white catholic counterpart these institution 
 develop all americans and future pro and perform exceptionally well 
 yet the fan never see these school compete against the other on 
 the surface little be happen to change the situation but father 
 grant be tirelessly work behind the scene 
   in june fr grant notify archbishop john cody that he would 
 seek admittance to the lhsaa to establish athletic relation with the 
 other catholic high school in the archdiocese he also notify those 
 school of his plan ask they to include st. aug on their 
 basketball baseball and track and field schedule for the 
 school year 
   father grant have no delusion that lhsaa commissioner t.h. ` ` muddy&#x27;&#x27 
 water would greet his request with open arm and he be right jesuit 
 principal father c.j. stallworth who have serve on the lhsaa executive 
 committee for year say he would do what he could to assist st. 
 augustine but add it would be helpful to he to have sister madalena 
 of xavier prep also apply for admission to bolster his request 
   father grant face resistance from other catholic school whose 
 coach set the athletic schedule the catholic league coach ignore 
 the lialo school when they set the schedule for the cyo 
 tournament and knights of columbus track meet also keep their event 
 segregate 
   at the january annual meeting the lhsaa deny st. augustine&#x27;s 
 membership request but amend its constitution to allow lhsaa and 
 lialo school to compete against each other 
   a year later rummel shaw and cor jesu be admit by a third
