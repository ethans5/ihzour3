 permanent scar on the collective memory of humanity and remind we of 
 the length to which authoritarian regime will go to maintain their 
 grip on power there be credible estimate that more than 
 chinese army soldier kill nearly people and wound many 
 thousand more in the decade since the massacre the chinese 
 communist party ccp have relentlessly pursue its agenda of control

 draconian national security law in mark a turning point in the 
 erosion of the city&#x27;s autonomy and freedom pro democracy activist 
 journalist and political figure have be arrest charge and 
 silence under the guise of national security while beijing tighten 
 its grip on the former british colony the passage of the article 
 legislation which far restrict basic freedom of speech and 
 assembly will continue the erosion of the ` ` country systems&#x27;&#x27 
 principle undermine the aspiration of the people of hong kong and 
 threaten the stability and prosperity of the entire region for this 
 reason i along with congressman gus bilirakis introduce a house 
 resolution that condemn the promulgation of the new article 
 legislation and call on other member of the international community 
 to similarly condemn the process of undermine freedom in hong kong 
   while the total number of life impact by china&#x27;s suppression of 
 basic freedom may never be fully know i be honor to serve as an 
 advocate for person who have witness firsthand the brutality of 
 the regime mr. ding jiaxi a prominent human right lawyer and 
 democracy advocate be wrongfully imprison in for his peaceful 
 activism and charge for the crime of ` ` subversion of state power.&#x27;&#x27 
 mr. ding&#x27;s courageous effort to defend the light of marginalize 
 community and promote great government accountability make he a 
 target of the regime&#x27;s ruthless crackdown on dissent his arbitrary 
 detention which include solitary confinement and physical abuse 
 serve as a stark reminder of the grave risk face by those who dare 
 to challenge the authoritarian rule of the ccp together with the 
 congressional tom lantos human rights commission&#x27;s defend freedoms 
 project i be committed to advocate for his release and reunion with

 instead honor for their work to improve society the image of a 
 single protestor who stand in the way of a column of tank roll 
 through the street of beijing in june will continue to inspire 
 those who will bravely face brute force for the sake of freedom in 
 confront tyranny and injustice we draw inspiration from the courage 
 and resilience of those who have dare to challenge authoritarian rule

 fill vacancy in the public sector youth unemployment be harm 
 our young people and cost our country billion of dollar each year 
 in lose productivity and tax revenue among other cost although the 
 total unemployment rate have reach a relative low percent the 
 youth unemployment rate be percent these young people have not have 
 a fair chance to use the high school or college education we strongly 
 urge they to obtain 
   by add new member to americorps this bill would need no 
 new administrative structure or bureaucracy and would allow unemployed 
 youth to earn a stipend obtain work experience and develop a good work 
 history to help secure future employment this bill would significantly 
 expand job opportunity for young people who have do what they could 
 to get a job but despite their good effort remain unemployed 
 americorps participant receive a living allowance and be also 
 eligible for an education award equal to the value of a pell grant 
 school loan forbearance health care benefit and childcare assistance 
 by expand americorps we would reduce the number of unemployed young 
 people provide they work skill and experience and help understaffed 
 state and local government provide service 
   this bill would also establish that the minimum wage for any 
 americorps state and national member would be percent of the 
 federal poverty line and would not allow for a decrease in that 
 amount as be allow under current law americorps member serve their 
 country and gain skill but we should increase the minimum wage for 
 everybody include national service member 
   for some time it have be clear that policy to address the most 
 stubborn form of unemployment need to be target in order to be 
 effective without significant targeting many young people will 
 continue to face their year as adult without job and with no 
 way to acquire necessary work experience they deserve a well start 
 in life as adult 
   i ask my colleague to support this urgently need target 
 assistance for our unemployed youth
