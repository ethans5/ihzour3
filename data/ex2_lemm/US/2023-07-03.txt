   introduction of the district of columbia national guard commanding 
                          general residency act 

                                  
                                 

                        hon eleanor holmes norton 

                       of the district of columbia 

                     in the house of representative 

                           monday july 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the district of columbia 
 national guard commanding general residency act which would require 
 the commanding general of the d.c. national guard to reside in d.c. 
 last congress the house committee on oversight and reform pass this 
 bill 
   d.c. have no control over the d.c. national guard instead the 
 president control the d.c. national guard which many americans 
 learn either during the january attack on the united states 
 capitol when the trump administration delay deploy the d.c. 
 national guard to the capitol for several hour or during the june 
 attack by federal law enforcement on largely peaceful protestor 
 outside the white house in which the d.c. national guard be use by 
 the trump administration as part of the attack in contrast governor 
 of the state and the territory that have national guards each 
 control their national guards 
   i have long introduce a bill the d.c. national guard home rule act 
 that would give the d.c. mayor control over the d.c. national guard 
 last congress the house&#x27;s fiscal year fy and fy national 
 defense authorization act include the d.c. national guard home rule 
 act but it be strip out of the final version of the fy and 
 fy ndaa because republicans threaten to vote against the must- 
 pass ndaa if it include the d.c. national guard home rule act 
   the commanding general of the d.c. national guard be the top official 
 in the d.c. national guard be appoint by the president and be a 
 federal employee there be residency requirement for government 
 official in federal law d.c. law and the law of jurisdiction 
 throughout the country in fact several state have law that require 
 the top official in their national guard to reside in their state and 
 it be highly likely that every state and territory only appoint 
 resident as the top official in their national guard the primary 
 reason residency requirement exist be so that government official 
 have a connection to the resident they serve and in depth knowledge of 
 the unique issue and challenge face by resident 
   congress have justifiably require that certain federal official 
 reside in the jurisdiction to which they be appoint include u.s. 
 district court judge u.s. marshals and u.s. attorneys similarly 
 congress which control the local d.c. court system have justifiably 
 require local d.c. judge and member of the d.c. judicial nomination 
 commission and the d.c. commission on judicial disabilities and tenure 
 to reside in d.c. 
   there be no reason that the commanding general of the d.c. national 
 guard a federal entity that serve only d.c. resident and that have 
 both a military and law enforcement role should not be require to 
 reside in d.c. a d.c. residency requirement for the commanding general 
 of the d.c. national guard will lead to a well relationship between 
 the d.c. national guard and d.c. resident and be a matter of fairness 
 for d.c. resident 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
