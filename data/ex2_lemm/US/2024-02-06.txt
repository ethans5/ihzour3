 introduction of the northern mariana islands and american samoa college 
                                access act 

                                  
                                 

                   hon gregorio kilili camacho sablan 

                     of the northern mariana island 

                     in the house of representative 

                        tuesday february 

   mr. sablan mr. speaker today i introduce the northern mariana 
 islands and american samoa college access act which would authorize 
 tuition assistance grant to cover the difference between in state and 
 out of state tuition cost for marianas and american samoa community 
 college graduate seek to attend a year public university 
   the importance of have an educate citizenry be a bedrock principle 
 of our nation and have be since our founding and in today&#x27;s 
 competitive job market a postsecondary education be increasingly 
 become a critical necessity for obtain a decent job with a decent 
 wage 
   the northern mariana islands have only be part of america for forty- 
 year we understand well that education be key to our continued 
 growth but the reality be that household income in the marianas be 
 less than half the national median the u.s. territory of american 
 samoa be in similar economic strait poverty and unemployment rate 
 there be among the high in the country 
   i believe the good way to improve economic condition in these 
 territory be to improve the educational opportunity available to 
 our resident unfortunately however neither the marianas nor 
 american samoa have a year institution of high education in 
 fact they be the only u.s. state or territory in the country 
 without a public year college or university each have an 
 accredit community college but academic offering be substantially 
 limited 
   student from these u.s. territory want the advantage of a 
 year university in another state or territory face significant 
 financial difficulty nonresident student spend an average of $ 
 in out of state tuition and fee more per year than their resident 
 peer at public year college accord to college board that 
 $ differential put a year college degree out of reach for 
 many student from our island where the median household income be 
 $ and many student in the marianas and american samoa want 
 to attend a year university not only face the cost of out of state 
 tuition but also the significant expense of travel the marianas be 
 over mile from the near state hawaii a $ way trip 
 by plane american samoa to hawaii be over mile which be over 
 $ way 
   the bill follow the model of p.l. the d.c. college access 
 act which allow student reside in the district of columbia to 
 apply for grant to help pay the cost of attend college outside 
 d.c. but much small in scope and cost my legislation create a 
 program through which public year school in the state d.c. 
 and other u.s. territory may be reimburse for offer in state 
 tuition to undergraduate student from the marianas and american samoa 
   the gentlewoman from american samoa mrs. radewagen be an original 
 cosponsor of the bill i urge my colleague to support this bipartisan 
 legislation and help give student from the marianas and american samoa 
 the mean need to make their educational dream a reality
