   mrs. steel mr. speaker i include in the record an article write 
 by williamson m. evers of california his work explain major flaw in 
 the draft of the california state board of education&#x27;s k-12 mathematics 
 instructional framework the board be have a final hearing today 

                     unscientific teaching methods 

        just as there be a science of reading instruction there be 
      a science of math instruction the scientific way of teaching 
      math include 
        have student memorize math fact like multiplication 
      table and addition and subtraction fact and standard 
      algorithm time test math procedure 
        teach computational procedure and conceptual 
      understanding together and not as progressive would have 
      it concept before procedure 
        stress that get answer to problem right and do 
      so quickly be component of math fluency and 
        bear in mind that commit math fact and procedure 
      to long term memory free the student&#x27;s mind to handle novel 
      problem 
        instead the progressive education author of the math 
      framework want student to learn through their own inquiry 
      and self discovery the author give little emphasis to 
      mastery of fact and standard algorithm the author want to 
      organize math instruction not in the architectonic system of 
      increase abstraction in which it have traditionally be 
      teach but instead in accordance with vague billowy ` ` big 
      ideas.&#x27;&#x27 educational researcher tom loveless retire from 
      the brookings lnstitution say ` ` the previous framework be 
      very clear that math fluency involve speed and accuracy the 
      propose framework reject speed as be even part of 
      fluency and that&#x27;s a problem.&#x27;&#x27 
        the newly revise framework delay fluency in 
      multiplication and division table until late in elementary 
      school this delay will spill over into subsequent math 
      learning and loveless believe that many student will be 
      unprepared for algebra i even by grade 
        as i have write before with my co author the late ze&#x27;ev 
      wurman 
        the framework promote only the progressive education 
      approach to teaching math call it ` ` student led&#x27;&#x27 
      instruction ` ` active learning,&#x27;&#x27 ` ` active inquiry,&#x27;&#x27 and 
      ` ` collaborative&#x27;&#x27 instruction but evidence from the 1950 
      through recent time show that this way of teaching math be 
      ineffective that evidence come from scrutinize carefully 
      design study feature randomized control and what be 
      call quasi experiment which approximate the effect of a 
      randomize assignment of student to different group quasi- 
      experiment look at case for example where adjoining 
      district with similar population or adjoining similar 
      school adopt different policy both sort of study be 
      much strong evidence than the case study that progressive 
      educator rely on 
        in the spring issue of american educator the magazine 
      of the american federation of teachers top educational 
      psychologist richard e. clark paul a. kirschner and john 
      sweller summarize ` ` decade of research&#x27;&#x27 that ` ` clearly 
      demonstrates&#x27;&#x27 that for almost all student ` ` direct 
      explicit instruction&#x27;&#x27 be ` ` more effective&#x27;&#x27 than inquiry- 
      base progressive education in math 
        clark kirschner and sweller conclude that after ` ` a half 
      century&#x27;&#x27 of progressive educator advocate inquiry base 
      teaching of math ` ` no body of sound research&#x27;&#x27 can be find 
      that support use that approach with ` ` anyone other than 
      the most expert students.&#x27;&#x27 evidence from the good study 
      they emphasize ` ` almost uniformly&#x27;&#x27 support ` ` full and 
      explicit&#x27;&#x27 instruction rather than an inquiry base approach 

                     misrepresentation of research 

        brian conrad of stanford&#x27;s math department point out that 
      the revise math framework contain much in the way of 
      ` ` false or misleading&#x27;&#x27 description of research on math 
      instruction it also cite ` ` unpublished paper with design 
      flaws,&#x27;&#x27 instead of rely solely on peer review publish 
      work conrad ask why do the framework ` ` still not adhere 
      to the level of 

 page e665 

      research quality&#x27;&#x27 call for by the what works 
      clearinghouse 
        conrad say that the framework be invoke neuroscience 
      literature ` ` in misleading ways&#x27;&#x27 to promote ` ` pseudo- 
      scientific claims&#x27;&#x27 about progressive education math 
      instruction improve pathway in the brain the framework 
      wrongly cite a paper to promote the general use of 
      ` ` invent strategies&#x27;&#x27 that is student devise their own 
      strategy as a proven approach to learn standard 
      algorithm 
        conrad find that the framework distort citation in a way 
      that indicate ` ` an ideological rather than evidence base 
      opposition to acceleration.&#x27;&#x27 he point out that ` ` there be 
      extensive literature with conclusion opposite&#x27;&#x27 that cite 
      in the framework ` ` but these be barely ever mentioned.&#x27;&#x27 
        as wurman and i have write before 
        state adopt education program and recommendation be 
      suppose to be ` ` research based.&#x27;&#x27 this do not just mean an 
      article or in a peer review journal it mean there be a 
      consensus or strong evidence of effectiveness in the 
      publish research if no strong evidence exist a practice 
      should not be broadly recommend 
        if the framework writer have want solid evidence they 
      would have rely on the final report and subgroup report of 
      the federal national mathematics advisory panel they 
      would have make even more use of the federal institute of 
      education sciences practice guide which be design for 
      teacher and curriculum writer 

                  rejection of algebra i in grade 

        the revise framework reject as do its early 
      iteration the time honor aim of prepare student to 
      take algebra i in grade grade algebra be the 
      policy in high perform foreign country whose inhabitant 
      will compete with america&#x27;s child in the future and that 
      grade goal be expressly part of the and 
      california math framework this current framework recommend 
      grade as when almost all student should take algebra 
      i. 
        student who plan to go to selective college and 
      university or who plan to major in stem field in college 
      need to pass calculus in high school take algebra in 
      grade allow they to do so 
        education journalist john fensterwald point out that 
        to discourage widespread enrollment in grade 
      algebra the framework&#x27;s diagram lay out stem and non stem 
      course pathway omit grade algebra as an option 
        there be possible but laborious and bureaucratically 
      troublesome workaround for stem incline student like 
      double booking math class in year but the system be 
      not friendly to the workaround and they be discourage to 
      student as conrad point out the framework author who 
      be ideologically oppose to acceleration have year to 
      come up with a way to accommodate those who need to take 
      calculus in high school but they didn&#x27;t do it 
        the recent effort in san francisco unify to make all 
      student take algebra i in grade be as conrad point 
      out ` ` a total failure exacerbate the very inequity it 
      aim to prevent.&#x27;&#x27 

       substitution of weak data science for rigorous algebra ii 

        the framework promote the idea of student take math- 
      lite data science course instead of algebra ii student who 
      take such math lite course will be ill prepared for math and 
      other stem course when they get to college 
        in his report on an early draft of the math framework 
      conrad say of the promotion of these data science class 
      ` ` whatever author be responsible for such a myopic view of 
      mathematic should never again be involve in the setting of 
      public policy guidance on math education.&#x27;&#x27 

           knee jerk opposition to tracking and acceleration 

        i have previously mention the framework&#x27;s opposition to 
      acceleration it also oppose tracking as conrad point out 
      the framework use ` ` citation misrepresentations&#x27;&#x27 to promote 
      its ` ` anti tracking narrative&#x27;&#x27 of heterogeneously group 
      classroom at all levels.&#x27;&#x27 
        homogeneously group classroom allow teacher to work 
      more effectively without the need to teach student who be 
      at widely different level student can be evaluate on 
      their achievement in different subject and place in 
      accelerate class only in the subject where they excel 
      this avoid the misplacement inherent in across the board 
      multi subject tracking the framework display an ideological 
      rather than empirical opposition to ability grouping 

                  class in wokeness instead of math 

        in chapter the framework push teach method in math 
      class that emphasize radically egalitarian ` ` social justice&#x27;&#x27 
      goal not only be radical egalitarianism ethically dubious 
      but math class should be for math not for political 
      indoctrination 
        for example the current framework contend that 
      mathematic be to be use to ` ` both understand and impact the 
      world.&#x27;&#x27 it argue that math teacher should hold the 
      political position that ` ` mathematic play a role in the 
      power structure and privilege that exist within our society 
      and can support action and positive change.&#x27;&#x27 
        furthermore accord to this official california 
      framework teacher should use mathematic politically ` ` to 
      analyze and discuss issue of fairness and justice.&#x27;&#x27 in an 
      elementary school classroom teacher would for example 
      have student ` ` study counting and compare to understand 
      fairness&#x27;&#x27 in the context of current and historical event 
        the framework recommend the fringy method of ` ` trauma- 
      inform pedagogy,&#x27;&#x27 which encourage student to suggest 
      ` ` recommendation and take action.&#x27;&#x27 teachers should also 
      it say provide ` ` curricular examples&#x27;&#x27 that provide 
      student with a mathematical toolkit and mindset ` ` to 
      identify and combat inequities.&#x27;&#x27 accord to the framework 
      student be ` ` to use mathematic to highlight inequities.&#x27;&#x27 
      then they should learn to use mathematic to transform the 
      world a rather inappropriate task for math class 

                                conclusion 

        there be close to student in california what 
      be do in california public school influence practice in 
      the rest of the country parent and taxpayer want math to 
      be teach sensibly it&#x27;s just a scientific reality that 
      child need to learn math fact and standard algorithm 
      this current california counterproductive math instructional 
      framework will produce a repeat of the math wars of the 1990 
      or a deep rebellion against public school and in favor of 
      parental choice

 paul finkelman and south eastern pennsylvanian lance j. sussman this

                        when freedom begin to ring 

                 by paul finkelman and lance j. sussman 

        in his famous letter to the jewish community of 
      newport rhode island george washington write that ` ` the 
      government of the united states which give to bigotry no 
      sanction to persecution no assistance require only that 
      they who live under its protection should demean themselves 
      as good citizen in give it on all occasion their 
      effectual support.&#x27;&#x27 these word be not the kind of quid 
      pro quo sometimes offer by european enlightenment leader 
      of the time to jews it be not an implicit warning that they 
      ought to behave themselves if they want to be tolerate 
        president washington under whose leadership many jews have 
      fight during the revolutionary war be simply recognize 
      that america only require of its jews what it require of 
      all its citizen at the founding america be already not a 
      christian nation and this be in large part because of its 
      jews 
        everywhere else in the world prior to the american 
      revolution jews be disfranchise politically isolated 
      and vulnerable even where they be relatively secure such 
      as in england they be not full citizen in on the 
      eve of the revolutionary war english jews could not vote 
      serve on jury serve in parliament be military officer 
      attend a university engage in some business become 
      barrister or practice some other profession jewish 
      immigrant have to pay special ` ` alien&#x27;&#x27 taxis forever 
      because they could not naturalize and as alien immigrant 
      jews be prohibit from own real estate or seagoe 
      vessel and from engage in colonial or foreign trade 
        thing have be somewhat well in england&#x27;s north american 
      colony where momentum toward full equality build as the 
      revolution grow nearer in part because of jewish support for 
      the patriot cause in jewish merchant in new york 
      city along with nearly christian businessman 
      sign a non importation agreement to boycott british good 
      jewish merchant in philadelphia and newport sign similar 
      agreement other most famously haym salomon join the 
      sons of liberty gershom mendes seixas the spiritual leader 
      of new york&#x27;s shearith israel the synagogue in what 
      become the united states actively support independence in

      reelect in thus become the jewish elect 
      public official in the new united states he serve until he 
      be kill in battle that august 
        most jews in new york philadelphia newport charleston 
      and savannah where the revolution be brew join the 
      cause early in do so they stake their claim to 
      political equality as a right not a set of privilege to be 
      grant 
        as they do nowhere in europe jews serve as officer in 
      the patriot army mordecai sheftall a savannah 
      businessman be a full colonel then the high rank 
      in the american army david salisbury franks rise to the rank 
      of lieutenant colonel serve as a diplomat to france and 
      morocco during the war and later become the assistant 
      cashier of the bank of the united states solomon bush whose 
      father have sign a non importation agreement end the war 
      as a lieutenant colonel and the deputy adjutant general of 
      the pennsylvania militia his young brother captain lewis 
      bush die in combat there be no jewish officer in the 
      british army or among the hessian mercenary during the 
      revolutionary war however alexander zuntz a hessian 
      civilian commissary serve as the hazzan of shearith israel 
      congregation while the british occupy new york city 
      impressed with american religious liberty he stay in new 
      york after the war and eventually become president of the 
      synagogue 
        in the independent united states every new state 
      constitution grant jews the right to vote though of 
      the of they originally limited office hold to 
      protestants or christians a few state retain establish 
      church or special state benefit for some faith religious 
      test for office directly deny jews full political 
      equality these state establishment do not deny jews 
      religious liberty or legal right but they make they and 
      member of other non favored faith less than equal 
      citizen this situation however be not destine to last 
      very long 
        when pennsylvania&#x27;s constitution for instance 
      require state legislator to ` ` acknowledge the scripture of 
      the old and new testament to be give by divine 
      inspiration,&#x27;&#x27 the state&#x27;s jews protest member of 
      philadelphia&#x27;s congregation mikveh israel study and 
      annotate all state constitution note where jews face 
      discrimination and then publish letter in newspaper 
      call attention to the new constitutions&#x27 objectionable 
      feature in late philadelphia&#x27;s jewish leader 
      petition the pennsylvania government to allow jews to hold 
      public office year later pennsylvania&#x27;s new 
      constitution remove the religious test for office holding 
        in congress operate under the articles of 
      confederation pass the northwest ordinance the forerunner 
      of subsequent law regulate the settlement of western 
      territory and the creation of new state the ordinance

      and religious liberty&#x27;&#x27 in the national territory write 
      before the constitution this be the national 
      guarantee of religious freedom the confederation congress 
      which include no jews and only the occasional catholic 
      could have easily establish some kind of non denominational 
      protestantism or christianity but it do no such thing 
        in that same year on behalf of congregation mikveh israel 
      revolutionary war veteran jonas phillips write to george 
      washington who be then serve as the preside officer of 
      the constitutional convention request the convention 
      protect jewish political right as it turn out the 
      convention have already agree to prohibit religious test for 
      office holding but the willingness of philadelphia jews to 
      lobby for their right far illustrate american jewry&#x27;s 
      newfound boldness 
        on july philadelphia hold a parade to celebrate 
      the ratification of the new constitution the grand federal 
      procession be lead by an interfaith group of clergyman 
      include a rabbi their arm interlock later when george

      from the city as a witness 
        the amendment ratify in confirm the right 
      of religious free exercise for all americans and guarantee 
      separation of church and state under the constitution jews 
      hold federal office even where they could not hold office 
      under exist state constitution thus in president 
      thomas jefferson appoint reuben etting to be the us marshal 
      in maryland even though he would not have be allow to 
      hold any office under that state&#x27;s constitution until 
      joel hart and mordecai manuel noah serve as diplomat under 
      jefferson and madison noah be later the sheriff of new york 
      city the ` ` boss&#x27;&#x27 of tammany hall and a local judge 
        the constitution do not preclude individual state from 
      bar jews from public office maryland massachusetts and 
      new jersey repeal these rule before the civil war while 
      north carolina do so during reconstruction new hampshire 
      finally abolish the practice in nor could the 
      constitutional expansion of jewish right end social 
      antisemitism antisemitism root in christian theology 
      nationalism bigotry private fear and ignorance and the 
      ranting of demagogue and conspiracy theorist will of 
      course never be abolish by government decree a political 
      system can regulate behavior and even promote tolerance but 
      can not end private intolerance and hatred in the old world 
      however anti jewish prejudice be often encourage 
      support or even mandate by government in america from 
      the outset the law be on the jews&#x27 side 
        furthermore america&#x27;s unprecedented acceptance of the jews 
      help to induce other western nation include 
      revolutionary france and mid century great 
      britain to grant jews similar right although the process 
      in both country be piecemeal halting and incomplete for 
      many year in britain for example lionel rothschild win 
      multiple election to parliament start in but be 
      unable to take his seat until after the jews relief act 
      have be pass full jewish political equality in britain 
      be not achieve until 
        as we approach the anniversary of the american 
      revolution on july it be important to recall how 
      the patriotism of jews lead to their political equality and a 
      national policy of religious liberty the united states 
      become the western nation to prohibit any religious 
      test for national public office have no national or official 
      faith have no law restrict jewish secular life or 
      religious observance and allow for freedom of worship and 
      belief on a broad national scale 
        when george washington write to the newport jewish 
      community this process be not yet complete but the 
      holdout be few and relatively insignificant the 
      revolutionary era set the stage for the ensue and a 
      half century of jewish flourish in a country where to 
      return again to the word of washington&#x27;s historic letter 
      minority enjoy religious freedom not because mere tolerance 
      have be extend to they but because ` ` all possess alike 
      liberty of conscience and immunity of citizenship.&#x27;&#x27
