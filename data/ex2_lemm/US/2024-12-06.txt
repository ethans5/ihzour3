   if service be a way of life then it&#x27;s important that you start by 
 understand the people you serve to do that i hold at least 
 town hall every month i served--81 in total to hear directly from the 
 people i represent sometimes those people didn&#x27;t agree with i 
 oftentimes i come away learn something new every time i walk 
 away with a renew dedication to work for they no matter who they 
 support or how they label themselves 
   from town hall to small business walk to tour of organization 
 just try to help i carry with i still a conversation that 
 inspire i whether it be the superstorm sandy survivor who just 
 want a fair process in rebuilding volunteer at food pantry who 
 just want to make sure that their neighbor didn&#x27;t go without a good 
 meal or those military family who be look for way to give back
