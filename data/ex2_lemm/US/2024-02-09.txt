                     for high crimes and misdemeanors

                         hon bennie g. thompson 

                              of mississippi 

                     in the house of representative 

                        tuesday february 

   mr. thompson of mississippi mr. speaker extreme maga republicans 
 have engage in a cynical and unserious attempt to impeach homeland 
 security secretary mayorkas their report to accompany h. res 
 resort to sloppy misrepresentation in an attempt to justify this 
 baseless political stunt 
   for example the report misquote professor frank bowman who 
 testify before the committee on homeland security on january 
 professor bowman testify that the constitution do not support 
 the impeachment of secretary mayorkas over mere policy difference the 
 majority report however twist a passage of professor bowman&#x27;s book 
 on impeachment and use it out of context to suggest policy difference 
 be ground for impeachment 
   republicans also try to misrepresent professor bowman&#x27;s writing 
 during the hearing but they do not afford professor bowman an 
 opportunity to explain his work i submit clarify question to 
 professor bowman to supplement the hearing record but the majority do 
 not transmit those question to professor bowman before the legislative 
 report be file in the house 
   i include in the record professor bowman&#x27;s response to my question 
 to make the professor&#x27;s thought on impeachment over policy difference 
 abundantly clear since the republican majority can not be bother to 
 conduct a proper investigation with a complete record 

      committee on homeland security u.s. house of representatives 


                   response to supplemental questions 

   frank o. bowman iii university of missouri curators&#x27 distinguished 
 professor emeritus floyd r. gibson missouri endowed professor emeritus 

     academic title provide for identification purpose only the 
 opinion express herein be those of the author do not reflect those 
  of any other person or entity and be not endorse by the university 
                              of missouri 

        question from mr. thompson republicans have portray 
      your previous academic writing as confirm their position 
      that mere policy difference may be a ground for impeachment 
      in particular that ` ` displeasure with administration 
      personnel and policy&#x27;&#x27 may be sufficient to warrant 
      impeachment be that correct 
        i have never write that mere policy difference would be 
      an adequate ground for impeachment to the contrary i join 
      with the consensus view of constitutional scholar that 
      ordinary policy difference be not a proper ground for 
      impeachment indeed this general principle be particularly 
      applicable to a disagreement on policy between a presidential 
      administration and a political party control only 
      house of congress and that by the very narrow of margin 
        the quotation to which the question allude mention 
      by chairman green and rep. bishop occur in the final 
      paragraph of chapter of the edition of my book high 
      crimes amp misdemeanor a history of impeachment for the age 
      of trump cambridge univ press both congressman take 
      the snippet of text they quote entirely out of context 
        in the reference section of chapter i discuss the only 
      prior impeachment of a u.s. cabinet officer president 
      ulysses grant&#x27;s secretary of war william belknap prior to 
      the quote passage i explain why no cabinet officer before 
      or after belknap have be impeach the primary and 
      obvious reason be that as i write any cabinet officer 
      ` ` whose behavior veer anywhere near an impeachable zone&#x27;&#x27 
      be simply remove by the president which be what happen 
      to belknap he take a bribe when president grant find out 
      he fire belknap but the house control by democrats for 
      the time since the civil war impeach the secretary 
      anyway as a means of politically damage president grant and 
      by extension the republicans in the upcoming election 
        in the final paragraph of chapter i be of course not 
      say that mere ` ` displeasure&#x27;&#x27 with either a person or a 
      policy be a constitutionally acceptable ground for 
      impeachment rather when a subordinate official have actually 
      commit ` ` treason bribery or other high crime and 
      misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27 

 page e131 

      as secretary of war belknap incontestably do congress 
      might elect to proceed with impeachment to signal its 
      displeasure 
        secretary mayorkas have not commit any impeachable 
      offense impeach a cabinet officer innocent of ` ` treason 
      bribery or other high crime and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27 to indicate 
      displeasure with administration policy or the officer&#x27;s 
      administration of that policy would be a profoundly anti- 
      constitutional act 
        question from mr. thompson in the past you have 
      write that impeachable ` ` high crime and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27 can 
      be interpret to include ` ` serious executive misconduct 
      include betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy 
      interests&#x27;&#x27 such as when a president subordinate the 
      nation&#x27;s interest to foreign interest republican rep. 
      guest suggest that you have write in the past about 
      foreign policy difference as ground for the 
      impeachment of president trump what you describe as trump&#x27;s 
      ` ` rolling destruction of american foreign policy&#x27;&#x27;--and that 
      your past write contradict your testimony at the january 
      hearing be foreign policy difference an 
      impeachable offense and how do foreign policy difference 
      differ from ordinary policy difference 
        i have write that of the accept historical 
      category of impeachable conduct in both the pre-1787 
      united kingdom and in the united states have be ` ` betrayal 
      of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests.&#x27;&#x27 however in 
      say this i be obviously not say that ordinary policy 
      difference between a presidential administration and the 
      oppose political party become impeachable simply because 
      the subject matter of the disagreement be foreign rather 
      than domestic policy 
        to the contrary long precedent establish that in the 
      u.s. impeachment context ` ` betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign 
      policy interests&#x27;&#x27 have have certain identify feature 
        for impeachment purpose a nation&#x27;s ` ` foreign 
      policy interests&#x27;&#x27 be not merely the transient preference 
      of a political party or faction rather they be endure 
      interest about which there be a broad societal consensus 
      ideally embody in statute treaty the practice of 
      multiple presidential administration and where applicable 
      the view of a nation&#x27;s diplomat foreign policy expert or 
      professional 
        the word ` ` betrayal&#x27;&#x27 imply not merely change 
      policy or adopt policy view contrary to one&#x27;s political 
      adversary but subvert the national interest for 
      illegitimate often personal motif 
        british impeachment that illustrate these feature include 
      the following 
        in after an expensive and unnecessary war with the 
      dutch the earl of clarendon be impeach in part for 
      seek payment from france to the british crown to evade 
      parliamentary control on royal finance 
        in the earl of danby be impeach for solicit on 
      behalf of the english king charles ii a bribe from louis xiv 
      of france in return for english neutrality in the franco- 
      dutch war 
        both clarendon and danby&#x27;s solicitation not only undercut 
      longstanding british foreign policy objective and subject 
      the british monarch to undue foreign influence but be a 
      bald attempt to avoid a significant parliamentary constraint 
      on royal overreach the requirement that the crown obtain 
      ` ` supplies&#x27;&#x27 i.e. fund in addition to the monarch&#x27;s 
      private wealth through the legislature 
        more relevant to the present case be the american 
      impeachment of senator william blount in and of 
      president donald trump in 
        sen. william blount blount then a u.s. senator concoct 
      a scheme to enrich himself by give great britain control of 
      the territory of louisiana and florida blount&#x27;s scheme be 
      obviously contrary to contemporary u.s. foreign policy 
      interest inasmuch as the american government and populace 
      want to expand into louisiana and florida or at the very 
      least to prevent great britain from assume control over 
      those territory in addition the article of impeachment 
      against blount charge he with violation of the neutrality 
      act of and also with violation of the treaty of 
      friendship limits and navigation between the united states 
      and spain because his scheme involve stir up native 
      american tribe to attack spanish official and interest 
        not only be blount&#x27;s scheme undeniably contrary to u.s. 
      foreign policy interest and to multiple treaty obligation 
      but it be a ` ` betrayal&#x27;&#x27 in the most obvious sense blount 
      try to sell out the interest of his country for personal 
      financial gain 
        although blount be acquit by the senate the historical 
      consensus be that the verdict turn on the decision that 
      senator be not ` ` civil officers&#x27;&#x27 subject to the 
      impeachment remedy under article ii section of the 
      constitution 
        president donald trump 
        president trump&#x27; impeachment involve article 
      the charging that trump committed ` ` high crime and 
      misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27 in relation to his scheme to coerce the 
      government of ukraine into announce investigation into 
      trump&#x27;s likely presidential opponent joe biden and the 
      charge obstruction of congress the article 
      be caption ` ` abuse of power,&#x27;&#x27 but as i have write it 
      ` ` braid together theme corruption damage to 
      foreign policy interest and injury to the democratic 
      process as the article of impeachment summarize the 
      matter

      interests&#x27;&#x27 allude to in the article be the interest of 
      the united states in support militarily and 
      diplomatically a country threaten and indeed physically 
      invade by russia a longstanding geopolitical opponent of 
      the united states together with the interest of the united 
      states in prevent russian territorial expansion up to the 
      border of the country of the nato alliance 
        these objective have be endorse as national security 
      interest of the united states over multiple presidential 
      administration through repeat bipartisan approval of 
      legislation authorize military and security aid to ukraine 
      they be also endorse by the entire diplomatic and national 
      security apparatus of the u.s government before and during 
      the trump administration itself for example when trump&#x27;s 
      white house office of management and budget omb place a 
      hold on congressionally mandate aid to ukraine in the july 
      as part of president trump&#x27;s scheme to coerce ukraine 
      every relevant agency of trump&#x27;s own administration except 
      omb question the hold and support military assistance to 
      ukraine as be in the national security interest of the 
      united states 
        thus trump&#x27;s impeachment precisely match the 
      template for ` ` betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy 
      interests&#x27;&#x27 describe above 
        the foreign policy interest of the united states in 
      that case be endure interest embrace by multiple 
      presidential administration endorse by the foreign policy 
      professional of the executive branch and manifest in 
      bipartisan legislation enact by multiple u.s. congress 
        and critically the ` ` betrayal&#x27;&#x27 of u.s. interest 
      consist of subvert the national interest for 
      illegitimate personal motif secure a personal political 
      advantage over a potential political rival in trump&#x27;s case 
      the betrayal be doubly severe because it amount to an 
      effort to use presidential power to corrupt the democratic 
      electoral process 
        secretary mayorkas nothing allege against secretary 
      mayorkas meet the traditional criterion for impeachment base 
      on ` ` betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests.&#x27;&#x27 the 
      most that can be say against he be that he have execute the 
      policy preference of president joe biden in relation to 
      immigration and border control issue and that the political 
      party in control of the house of representatives disapprove 
      of those policy preference there be no indication that the 
      secretary&#x27;s action or indeed the biden administration&#x27;s 
      policy choice be contrary to establish national foreign 
      policy interest to the contrary u.s. policy regard 
      immigration and border control have vary from administration 
      to administration and congress to congress as the challenge 
      need and preference of the country have vary more 
      importantly there be absolutely no indication that secretary 
      mayorkas have take any official action for corrupt or 
      illegitimate personal motif 
        to repeat the central point ordinary policy difference 
      between a presidential administration and the oppose 
      political party do not become impeachable simply because the 
      subject matter of the disagreement be foreign rather than 
      domestic policy 
        question from mr. thompson rep. crane suggest that 
      secretary mayorkas have betray the nation and that betrayal 
      of the nation would be sufficient to warrant impeachment be 
      you aware of any evidence that secretary mayorkas have 
      betray the united states and rep. crane far suggest 
      that you say ` ` betrayal of the nation&#x27;&#x27 be a potential 
      ground for impeachment whereas you actually say ` ` betrayal 
      of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests&#x27;&#x27 be a ground for 
      impeachment what precisely do you mean 
        i do not say in my testimony to the committee or elsewhere 
      that that ` ` betrayal of the nation&#x27;&#x27 be a ground for 
      impeachment i have agree with charles black that decent 
      definition of ` ` high crime and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27 that cover 
      most case be offenses ` ` which be extremely serious which 
      in some way corrupt or subvert the political and governmental 
      process and which be plainly wrong in themselves to a 
      person of honor or to a good citizen regardless of word on 
      the statute books.&#x27;&#x27 nothing allege against secretary 
      mayorkas meet this general definition of impeachable 
      conduct 
        i have also write that specific category of 
      impeachable ` ` high crime and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27 be ` ` betrayal of 
      the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests.&#x27;&#x27 in my previous 
      answer i explain what be mean by that phrase for purpose 
      of impeachment and i demonstrate why secretary mayorkas&#x27 
      conduct do not fall within it 
        finally i be aware of no evidence that secretary mayorkas 
      have betray the nation to the contrary base on the fact 
      of which i be aware secretary mayorkas appear to be a 
      capable dedicated public servant try as good he can to 
      carry out the policy priority of the president of the 
      united states and to manage the perennial and intractable 
      problem relate to immigration and control of the u.s. 
      southern border
