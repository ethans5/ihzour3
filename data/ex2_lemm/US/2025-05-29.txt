   ms. delauro mr. speaker i thank my colleague and good friend the 
 ranking member of the rules committee jim mcgovern he be a tireless 
 fighter for work family and i be proud to be in that fight with 
 he i be glad to call out the egregious giveaway to billionaire and 
 big corporation be orchestrate in this republican tax bill 
   the $ and counting count because we do not have the 
 full cbo score as this bill be be jam through the house be what 
 we be talk about that be what republicans be prepare to shower 
 on the rich company and their billionaire owner while give 
 mere penny to the middle class working class and vulnerable 
 family who be struggle with the cost of living crisis 
   president trump campaign on lower price he pledge to ` ` bring 
 food cost down on day one.&#x27;&#x27 instead the opposite have happen his 
 own usda recently report egg price could rise percent over the 
 next year since take office he have do nothing to help family 
   this be shameful because the alternative be clear a few week ago 
 i reintroduce the american family act legislation to reinstate the 
 improve expand child tax credit the american family act would 
 create the strong version of the tax credit ever index the value 
 of the credit to inflation and it would establish a baby bonus to help 
 family in that critical year after birth 
   the datum prove that the expand child tax credit that we pass in 
 deliver the great middle class tax cut in a generation 
 reach nearly families--61 child it be the 
 antidote to child poverty and to inflation it give real money back to 
 million of work family in the form of monthly check cut 
 child hunger by a and bring child poverty down to the low 
 record level in history 
   the water down imitation of a child tax credit include in this 
 bill will not continue this progress i want to take this time to 
 address a few misconception about the child tax credit that have be 
 present in this debate so far accord to the columbia center on 
 poverty and social policy nearly out of child 
 child nationwide be exclude from full credit because their family 
 income be too low to qualify this be not an issue of work 
 requirement the current version of the ctc function as an income 
 requirement hurt family who work hard or be retire grandparent 
 who be now care for a generation but simply do not earn 
 enough to qualify family with parent who work hard will be exclude 
 because their wage be too meager be you truly say that 
 billionaire and corporation need tax break more than the young of 
 your constituent this bill would make that problem bad not well 
   this bill pay lip service to the child tax credit i believe the 
 american people need more than that 
   our bill be the real deal the improve expand child tax credit 
 fix this problem we need that now more than ever across the 
 country family be live paycheck to paycheck while price for 
 everyday good and essential service from egg to gasoline to 
 medicine and childcare continue to rise 
   this should not be a partisan issue republican like former senator 
 mitt romney senator josh hawley and even vice president j.d. vance 
 have support the child tax credit because the evidence that it help 
 family be so overwhelming 
   but republican leadership in congress have be clear they want to 
 give the corporate lobbyist everything they ask for and then some 
 they be gutte medicaid food stamp and anything else that stand 
 in the way of more money for billionaire 
   this bill be not respond to the cost of living crisis this bill 
 be pour gasoline on the fire my promise to american family be 
 that i will fight as hard as i can with every ally i can find to stop 
 this corrupt giveaway and focus on bring down the cost of live 
 through a proven policy the expand child tax credit not the meager 
 substitute in this bill

                     in the house of representative 

                          thursday may 

   mrs. miller meeks mr. speaker i rise today to recognize the 
 importance of the orphan drug act in drive rare disease therapy 
 clinical research in my district at the university 

 page e487 

 of iowa as a physician a legislator and a member of the rare disease 
 congressional caucus i have see firsthand the life change impact 
 that medical innovation can have on patient battle rare disease 
 iowa&#x27;s congressional district be home to clinical trial for 
 several rare disease that lack a food and drug administration fda)- 
 approve therapy include becker muscular dystrophy gaucher disease 
 type and limb girdle muscular dystrophy for these patient and the 
 million of americans suffer from rare disease scientific 
 advancement represent more than just medical progress they offer hope 
 where none previously exist 
   that hope would not be possible without the orphan drug act which 
 have serve as the foundation for rare disease drug development for over 
 decade the orphan drug act&#x27;s most critical incentive be orphan 
 drug exclusivity which be a year period of market exclusivity 
 this incentive ensure that innovator willing to take the 
 extraordinary risk of develop a in class treatment for a 
 complex condition affect a small patient population be 
 appropriately reward 
   for many rare disease the fda approve treatment be a 
 lifeline these therapy often require year of research billion in 
 investment and considerable perseverance to bring these medicine to 
 patient without a strong and reliable exclusivity framework these 
 treatment simply would not exist congress intend orphan exclusivity 
 to serve as ` ` a marketplace orient solution that provide incentive 
 for private enterprise to develop orphan drugs.&#x27;&#x27 fda establish 
 regulation that aim to protect this critical economic incentive 
 while also encourage continued innovation for a rare disease by 
 allow a follow on product that be the same drug for the same use to 
 break orphan exclusivity if it demonstrate great efficacy great 
 safety or a ` ` major contribution to patient care&#x27;&#x27 relative to the 
 original orphan drug congress codify these regulation in 
   congress have long recognize that the ` ` major contribution care&#x27;&#x27 
 prong of the ` ` clinical superiority&#x27;&#x27 standard be mean to be a high 
 bar we do not intend for minor modification such as change in 
 dosing frequency or formulation to erode the exclusivity protection of 
 the innovator drug unless such modification result in a 
 significant clinical benefit in treat the underlie condition if 
 we allow marginal improvement rather than true clinical advancement 
 to justify break orphan exclusivity we undermine the very incentive 
 that encourage company to develop in class therapy in the 
 place the fda have a clear precedent for maintain a high bar 
 for clinical superiority determination if we lower the bar for 
 break orphan exclusivity especially for ` ` major contribution to 
 patient care,&#x27;&#x27 we will undermine the future of rare disease drug 
 development 
   lower the bar will deter investment in in class therapy by 
 reduce the certainty that company will be able to benefit from the 
 exclusivity protection congress intend lower the bar will create 
 regulatory uncertainty lead to litigation market instability and 
 hesitation from investor who fund rare disease innovation lower 
 the bar will set a dangerous precedent for copycat product with few 
 modification encourage incremental change rather than bold 
 scientific advancement lower the bar will hurt patient most of 
 all delay or discourage the development of a ever therapy 
 for the nearly rare disease that still lack an fda approve 
 treatment 
   as a physician i know that true medical breakthrough require bold 
 investment sustained commitment and regulatory certainty as a 
 legislator i be committed to preserve the integrity of the orphan 
 drug act and ensure that it continue to drive life change 
 treatment for patient fda must apply the law a congress intend and 
 not allow minor modification to erode exclusivity protection that 
 serve as the foundation for rare disease innovation today i be 
 call on my fellow member of the rare disease congressional caucus 
 to stand together to protect the value of the incentive establish in 
 the orphan drug act
