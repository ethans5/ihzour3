                     in the house of representative 

                        wednesday march 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce a bill that would permit 
 commercial filmmaking and photography on the ground of the u.s. 
 capitol complex currently such filmmaking and photography be only 
 authorize in union square 
   in many country freedom of expression be limited and while the 
 january insurrection be of the great threat to american 
 democracy in history the capitol and the united states remain beacon 
 of democracy for the world we should encourage commercial filmmaking 
 and photography at the capitol to share this symbol of democracy with 
 the world movie and television show that involve the capitol should 
 not have to go to other city or use a fake building 
   this bill would allow commercial filmmaking and photography outside 
 of the capitol and congressional office building by permit so long as 
 neither chamber be in session the policy allow commercial 
 filmmaking and photography in union square show that the capitol 
 police can handle commercial filmmaking and photography at the capitol 
 complex especially when congress be not in session however that 
 vantage point capture the least familiar view of the capitol 
 prevent commercial filmmaker and photographer from shoot in 
 front of the capitol be neither business friendly nor true to the 
 nation&#x27;s democratic tradition encourage commercial filmmaking and 
 photography at the capitol would help spread the story of democracy 
 around the world 
   there be no good reason why commercial filmmaking and photography 
 should be confine to union square specifically my bill would give 
 the capitol police complete discretion to issue a permit for commercial 
 filmmaking and photography at the capitol complex under the same term 
 and condition as those for commercial filmmaking and photography in 
 union square no policy or security reason exist to justify limit 
 commercial filmmaking and photography at the capitol complex to union 
 square especially consider that permit be necessary visitor be 
 regularly see take video and picture around the capitol complex 
 demonstrate the arbitrary nature of limit commercial filmmaking 
 and photography to union square 
   this bill would provide the capitol police authority to charge fee 
 to cover any cost incur by the architect of the capitol aoc for 
 permit approval the fee would be deposit into the capitol trust 
 account which be establish to accept fee collect from commercial 
 filmmaking and photography permit for union square amount in the 
 capitol trust account would be available without fiscal year limitation 
 for maintenance improvement and project the aoc consider 
 appropriate subject to the approval of the appropriations committees 
   view of the capitol be among america&#x27;s most iconic limit 
 commercial filmmaking and photography of the capitol an important 
 vehicle for tell the nation&#x27;s story do not serve the american 
 people indeed most of the world revere our system of government 
 largely through commercial film and photo of the capitol a symbol of 
 our democracy at work commercial film and photograph of the capitol 
 the seat of our democracy be perhaps the good modern vehicle for 
 tell the nation&#x27;s story and showcase its democratic system of 
 government republicans and democrats alike revere the image of the 
 capitol as a symbol of democracy my bill would enable appropriate 
 permit commercial filmmaking and photography of the capitol and 
 would create economic benefit for the nation the district of columbia 
 and private business 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill

                         tuesday march 

   mr. connolly mr. chair i rise today in strong opposition to this 
 bill certainly we can agree that federal agency like many large 
 employer need to reevaluate their office space requirement in 
 response to more hybrid work option post covid 
   but this be not a new endeavor for the federal government this be 
 something the federal government be do for more than a decade 
 before the pandemic 

 page e249 

   when we pass the telework enhancement act in federal telework 
 participation be below percent by that number grow by more 
 than percent to percent during that intervening period agency 
 create hoteling option reevaluate office space need and even 
 identify telework saving associate with reduce real estate 
 requirement 
   so again this be not new territory for the federal government what 
 be new be the mindless and punitive approach republicans have start 
 to take towards agency decision about workplace environment 
   during the pandemic republicans on the committee on oversight and 
 accountability vote to require percent of federal employee back 
 into the office for full time in person work a standard that do not 
 exist even before the pandemic and that envision a century 
 workplace complete with hole punch timecard 
   concurrently they oppose my legislation the chai suthammanont 
 remembrance act to implement common sense workplace public health 
 standard to protect federal employee during covid and any future 
 public health emergency 
   their opposition be as i say mindless and punitive 
   with this bill house republicans be at it again this bill would 
 establish an arbitrary requirement for agency to dispose of property 
 and lease 
   it make no accommodation for the workplace flexibility our federal 
 agency need not just to compete for talent but also to accommodate 
 those with disability or military spouse whose employment would not 
 be possible without hybrid or remote work 
   this bill demagogue the issue of hybrid work at a time when we 
 should be take meaningful action to help the federal workplace remain 
 competitive and productive 
   i welcome the administration&#x27;s effort to end pandemic era remote 
 work posture while strengthen robust telework option for federal 
 employee which we help create with the telework enhancement act 
   there be a way forward that help agency adjust to post pandemic 
 workforce need but this bill be not the solution and i urge my 
 colleague to oppose it
