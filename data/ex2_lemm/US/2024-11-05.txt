      framework may include but be not limit to provide 
      comprehensive transparent public education implement 
      substance misuse prevention program minimize the 
      potential for adverse reaction and develop implementable 
      risk mitigation safety and ethical monitoring strategy 
      moreover it will be vital to consider how congress can good 
      support state in develop and adopt scalable 
      infrastructure and sustainable service delivery system that 
      ensure proper accountability and monitoring as well as 
      facilitate access and equity in utilization with a
