 our tribal community thing that can be difficult to face it would 
 be difficult to find a native person that have not have the indian 
 boarding school era impact their family or community 
   it be estimate that by nearly percent of native child 
 be enrol in of at least currently know indian boarding 
 school across state thousand of our child be tear or 
 coerce from family and community by the federal government or 
 religious entity to be ` ` assimilated&#x27;&#x27 into american society 
   student at indian boarding school be force to change their 
 entire sense of be with new name hair language and culture 

 page e925 

 during these assimilation practice many be not able to see their 
 family or speak their language and even experience verbal and sexual 
 abuse 
   there be so many story of child that never return home 
 future artist doctor language keeper storyteller and leader 
 skip generation we still feel those impact today 
   the federal government and our country must do well to acknowledge 
 its legacy and understand the full truth of these policy 
   this congress i&#x27;m work with congressional native american caucus 
 co chair tom cole on the truth and healing commission on indian 
 boarding school policies in the united states act this legislation 
 seek healing for steal native child and their community 
   originally introduce by now secretary deb haaland this bill would 
 establish a formal commission to investigate document and acknowledge 
 past injustice of the federal government&#x27;s indian boarding school 
 policies this commission be a critical step to allow native family 
 and community to begin to heal 
   representative cole and i be in the process and narrow down the 
 legislative text and hope to introduce the bill again soon it receive 
 bipartisan support in the past which show that our relative be 
 be see and both the house and the senate hold hearing on the bill 
 last congress which show our colleague be ready to listen 
   the importance of fully understand the impact of indian boarding 
 school policy in the united states transcend political line and i 
 know that share these experience and learn the truth be a brave 
 and sometimes hard thing to do 
   we hope that in this difficult process tribal community will also 
 support each other physically mentally and spiritually i will 
 continue to amplify the voice of indian country in the hall of 
 congress and encourage my colleague to join i in that mission

 code which relate to the jurisdiction and organization of the local 
 d.c. court congress can correct this injustice to d.c. resident who 
 pay all federal taxis by amend the hra even before d.c. become 
 the state 
   year after passage of the hra matter involve the local 
 d.c. court almost never come to congress so congress know virtually 
 nothing about d.c.&#x27;s local court and could not care less 
 notwithstanding the importance of d.c.&#x27;s local court to d.c. 
 resident the council which be the repository of knowledge and 
 experience for d.c.&#x27;s criminal and civil justice system and the body 
 accountable to d.c. resident be irresponsibly leave on the sideline 
 while congress remain the sole entity that may correct flaw in d.c.&#x27;s 
 local court 
   under the hra the council have no authority to ` ` enact any act 
 resolution or rule with respect to any provision of title of the 
 district of columbia code relate to organization and jurisdiction of

   d.c. have never have authority over its local court even when it be 
 responsible for pay for their operation under the national capital 
 revitalization and self government improvement act of the federal 
 government assume the cost for several state level function 
 include the court this bill would not change the courts&#x27 funding 
 this bill also would not change the authority of the president to 
 nominate or the senate to confirm local d.c. judge which have be 
 within their purview since the creation of the modern local court 
 system in 
   this bill be an important step to increase democratic self government 
 for d.c. i urge my colleague to support this bill
