   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in opposition to h.r. the no 
 rogue rulings act of 
   just as house and senate republicans have cede their constitutional 
 responsibility to conduct oversight on the executive branch 
 republicans want to force federal judge to give up their power of 
 judicial review the duty and responsibility of federal court be to 
 review law and policy that have a national impact federal court 
 be not local court by design their role be national and be not 
 limit to state or county limit the ability of federal 
 court to carry out their duty would undermine the right and freedom 
 of all americans 
   the no rogue rulings act of would prevent federal district court 
 judge from provide nationwide injunction relief when of 
 president trump&#x27;s executive order policy or action violate 
 people&#x27;s constitutional right and freedom nationwide injunction be 
 issue against the federal government when its action be 
 unconstitutional and have a broad national effect if a federal judge 
 can no long issue a national injunction the administration could 
 continue to violate the right of the american people until the case 
 reach the supreme court this bill be design to drastically limit 
 federal judges&#x27 ability to prevent unconstitutional action from do 
 broad harm it be about give more power to donald trump 
   donald trump be lose in court because he keep try to do 
 unlawful and unconstitutional thing not because of judicial 
 overreach this bill a scheme to give more power to the president 
 make it easy for he to carry out his illegal action without 
 consequence 
   i urge my colleague to reject this bill
