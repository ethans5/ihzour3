                     in the house of representative 

                        thursday october 

   mr. garamendi mr. speaker pro tempore today i reintroduce the 
 ` ` close agency loopholes to the jones act of 2023,&#x27;&#x27 which would close 
 nearly year of anti jones act decision know as ` ` letter 
 rulings&#x27;&#x27;--by u.s. customs and border protection cbp 
   as chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on readiness and 
 have serve as rank member of the subcommittee on coast guard and 
 maritime transportation from to i be commit to rebuild 
 the u.s.-flagged fleet include international and jones act vessel 
 for decade congress have stand idly by while federal regulator 
 chip away at the jones act allow foreign vessel pay poverty 
 wage to take job from americans work in our maritime industry 
 that must stop 
   in december congress enact my amendment to the outer 
 continental shelf lands act as section of the william m. mac 
 thornberry national defense authorization act for fiscal year 
 public law affirm that the application of the 
 constitution law and civil and political jurisdiction of the united 
 states to the outer continental shelf also apply to non mineral 
 energy resource and explore for develop produce 
 transporting or transmit such resource as i state in my remark 
 on september congressional record vol no 
 congress always intend u.s. law to apply to any form of exploration 
 development production transportation and transmission of energy 
 resource under the outer continental shelf lands act of 
   on january president biden&#x27;s executive order no 
 direct federal agency to maximize the use of american 
 mariner american build ship and u.s.-flagged vessel under the 
 jones act in response to my amendment enact in the fy21 noaa u.s. 
 cbp issue a headquarters rule letter ` ` hq h309186&#x27;&#x27 on january 
 correctly hold that the transportation of ` ` scour protection&#x27;&#x27 
 material from the port of providence rhode island to a wind project 
 on the outer continental shelf off the southeast shore of martha&#x27;s 
 vineyard be a coastwise activity under the jones act 
   on march the national trade association for the offshore 
 wind industry send a letter to the commissioner of cbp request that 
 the agency withdraw hq h309186 in this letter the offshore wind 
 industry mischaracterize my september remark from the 
 congressional record as somehow support its request that cbp 
 withdraw the january letter ruling on march cbp 
 issue a revise headquarters ruling letter hq h317289 contradict 
 its january letter ruling and the president&#x27;s state policy 
 allow foreign vessel to construct energy project on the outer 
 continental shelf 
   to be clear my september remark in the congressional record 
 state that my amendment to outer continental shelf lands act simply 
 clarify that all form of offshore energy development be indeed 
 subject to the same u.s. law that apply to the offshore oil and gas 
 industry that do not mean that i accept the validity of the many 
 administrative loophole to the jones act create by decade of bad 
 letter ruling and poor enforcement by cbp rather i have long hold 
 that many of the activity regulator have incorrectly allow the 
 offshore oil and gas industry to engage in use foreign flagged 
 vessel be clear violation of the plain text of the jones act and 
 original congressional intent 
   it be now clear to i that the regulator at cbp be unwilling to 
 fully implement the jones act as direct by president biden&#x27;s 
 executive order my ` closing agency loopholes to the jones act&#x27 
 would finally force federal regulator to enforce the law as congress 
 intend in maximize job opportunity for american mariner 
 u.s.-flagged vessel and domestic shipyard worker in effect my 
 legislation would also compel cbp to implement the president&#x27;s state 
 policy by fully enforce the jones act 
   on april the house committee on transportation and 
 infrastructure pass key section from my bill in the ` ` coast 
 guard authorization act of 2023&#x27;&#x27 h.r. section and from 
 my bill be now incorporate as section notification and section 
 publication of fines and penalties of h.r. 
   section require foreign flagged vessel purport to operate 
 under a jones act exemption to notify cbp and post online its legal 
 basis for operate on the outer continental shelf currently cbp use 
 an honor system for foreign vessel operate on the outer continental 
 shelf and their legal basis for doing which undermine the agency&#x27;s&#x27 
 ability to enforce the jones act properly and enable outright fraud 
 section require cbp to publish online any penalty against 
 foreign flagged vessel operate illegally on the outer continental 
 shelf include for fail to notify the agency of the purport 
 jones act exemption in advance 
   for this congress i also require in my bill that offshore energy 
 developer on the outer continental shelf pay a prevail wage under 
 current law project developer operate in the united states&#x27 
 exclusive economic zone at sea can pay poverty wage exploit 
 foreign worker and undermine american mariners&#x27 ability to compete 
 for this work after decade of fail promise we be finally 
 build the clean energy economy of the future american mariner be 
 ready willing and able to work in the burgeon offshore wind 
 industry but they can not be expect to compete against foreign flag 
 vessel pay poverty wage to worker with no legally guarantee 
 collective bargaining right or labor standard 
   mr. speaker pro tempore i encourage all member of the house to 
 cosponsor this critical and long overdue legislation
