                        tuesday november 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce a bill that would 
 designate certain area of the district of columbia as empowerment 
 zone this bill would effectively reauthorize many of the unique 
 federal tax incentive for business investment in d.c. that expire in 
 d.c.&#x27;s downtown which have be the economic engine of the city 
 have be particularly hard hit by the increase in remote and hybrid 
 work since the covid-19 pandemic make this bill especially 
 important 
   in congress create the national empowerment zone program to 
 encourage investment in low income community and delegate to federal 
 agency the authority to designate community as empowerment zone 
 d.c. be not among those so designated however in work 
 primarily with republicans in congress i create federal tax 
 incentive for investment in d.c. by business and individual the 
 business incentive be similar to but more generous than those 
 available under the national empowerment zone program i get the d.c. 
 incentive reauthorize regularly until when congress refuse to 
 extend the d.c. incentive at the same time congress extend the 
 national empowerment zone program and the program be last extend 
 through under my bill low income neighborhood in d.c. would be 
 treat as empowerment zone as long as the national empowerment zone 
 program remain in effect 
   congress have recognize that the benefit of tax incentive for 
 investment in economically distressed community outweigh the cost 
 as it have continuously extend the national empowerment zone program 
 the tax incentive for d.c. be the only tax incentive for a big city 
 that be not extend even though they be initially create by 
 republicans with the help of several democrats 
   the expiration of the tax incentive for d.c. be tragically time 
 as the low income part of d.c. which need the incentive most be 
 ready for revitalization as we work to revitalize downtown d.c. and 
 wards and the need for these incentive for d.c. be of 
 paramount importance the tax incentive for d.c. be effective and 
 their cost be de minimis 
   i strongly urge my colleague to support this bill
