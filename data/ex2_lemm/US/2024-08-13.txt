                         tuesday august 

   mr. garamendi mr. speaker today i introduce the ` ` justice for 
 victims of foreign vessel accidents act,&#x27;&#x27 with congressman henry c. 
 ` ` hank&#x27;&#x27 johnson d ga as the original cosponsor 
   for year i have be work to recapitalize the u.s.-flag 
 international fleet of oceangoing commercial vessel need to support 
 our military i be honor to serve as the top democrat on the house 
 committee on transportation and infrastructure&#x27;s subcommittee on coast 
 guard and maritime transportation from to 
   less than a week after the foreign flagged dalia collide with the 
 francis scott key bridge in baltimore harbor the vessel&#x27;s singapore- 
 base corporate owner file in the u.s. district court for maryland to 
 limit its total liability for the bridge collapse and recovery effort 
 to just $ value the vessel at $ in do so 
 the dalia&#x27;s owner invoke a federal law enact in limit their 
 legal liability for damage to the dollar value of the vessel and its 
 cargo minus salvage cost this tragic accident which kill and 
 injure worker on the francis scott key bridge call into serious 
 question why u.s. law afford the owner of vessel fly foreign 
 ` ` flag of convenience&#x27;&#x27 any liability shield 
   foreign flag commercial vessel like the dalia be typically 
 register under the law of unscrupulous jurisdiction that lack any 
 navy coast guard or ability to inspect commercial vessel to ensure 
 safety prevent environmental degradation or stop maritime labor 
 abuse furthermore foreign ocean carrier or other vessel owner 
 fly flag of convenience be often domicile in offshore tax haven 
 for these reason and more u.s.-flag commercial vessel be already at 
 a competitive disadvantage globally the u.s. judicial system should 
 not protect foreign competitor to the detriment of victim and their 
 family 
   that be why our ` ` justice for victims of foreign vessel accidents 
 act&#x27;&#x27 would increase the liability for foreign flagged vessel to up to 
 time the dollar value of the vessel and its cargo minus expense 
 this would ensure that victim and their family can hold foreign 
 vessel owner accountable in federal court for wrongful death or 
 personal injury claim current law only allow compensation for lost 
 wage importantly our bill would maintain the current liability 
 threshold for u.s.-flagged vessel include those compliant with the 
 jones act which unlike foreign flagged vessel be subject to u.s. law 
 and inspect regularly by the coast guard and state regulator 
 lastly our bill would apply the high liability level for damage by 
 foreign flagged vessel to march the night before the francis 
 scott key bridge&#x27;s collapse 
   mr. speaker i strongly support the maryland delegation and the 
 biden harris administration&#x27;s ongoing work to rebuild the francis scott 
 key bridge with federal funding as quickly as possible i hope that the 
 house will act swiftly on congressman kweisi mfume&#x27;s d md ` ` baltimore 
 bridge response invests and deliver global economic bridge relief 
 act&#x27;&#x27 h.r. in the meantime i encourage all member of the 
 house will join we in cosponsor this commonsense reform

                            hon chuck edwards 

                            of north carolina 

                     in the house of representative 

                         tuesday august 

   mr. edwards mr. speaker i include in the record the follow 
 newsletter to give an update to my constituent on issue surround 
 spending bill healthcare consolidation and government regulation 
        dear friend i&#x27;m disappoint that the do our job act the 
      bill i introduce to keep we in dc until our budget work be 
      complete do not get the support it need and deserve to 
      make it to a committee hearing but i&#x27;ve learn that many 
      idea need to be introduce many time before they get 
      traction fix how washington work will not be easy so i 
      be undeterred and i&#x27;ll continue to push for this reform 
        while i enjoy time in the district with my constituent i 
      would rather be in dc pass the rest of our appropriation 
      bill and avoid the threat of another government shutdown 
      or continue resolution 
        the do our job act would have make sure that congress do 
      not leave for this district work period unless the house 
      pass all annual appropriation bill while the house 
      appropriations committee which i be a member of pass all 
      spending bill to be consider by the house the house 
      have only pass of these spending bill 
        in the nearly decade that our current appropriation 
      process have be in place congress have only pass all 
      bill time time in almost year western 
      north carolinians and the american people deserve well than 
      an percent success rate for fund our government 
        the american people have be far too generous with we and 
      it be high time that we fix how washington work 


            increase health cost decrease quality of care 

        western north carolina be no strange to high healthcare 
      cost and as a member of the house budget committee i want 
      to share what we learn from the committee hearing that 
      evaluate the budgetary effect of healthcare consolidation 
        the hearing discuss the unsustainable trajectory of 
      federal health spending and policy opportunity to combat 
      consolidation and enhance free market competition or to put 
      it simply how to make health care more affordable and more 
      accessible for the american people 
        the u.s. be see a surge in hospital merger result 
      in increase federal health spending and high patient 
      cost simultaneously patient have be experience low 
      quality of care which be a less easily quantifiable but 
      arguably bad consequence than deal with high cost 
        this be the reality right here in our mountain follow 
      the mission hca healthcare acquisition in that be why i 
      have demand the federal trade commission the agency 
      responsible for all acquisition and merger re review the 
      mission hca deal and take action to overturn the acquisition 
      if malfeasance be find 
        it be my mission as a member of the house budget committee 
      and house appropriations committee to promote policy and 
      funding that deter consolidation and promote great choice 
      affordability and quality of care for the citizen of nc-11 
      and beyond 


                     revitalize community in wnc 

        during my time in our mountain i continuously hear from 
      constituent who be interested in develop environmentally 
      challenge property in western north carolina but decide 
      not to because of the significant cleanup redevelopment 
      cost and time delay that be often require from 
      environmental contamination 
        the economic opportunity for distressed communities act 
      that i introduce would provide a tax incentive for those who 
      decide to redevelop superfund and brownfield area by 
      designate such environmentally challenge property as 
      opportunity zone by incentivize cleanup and development 
      of brownfield and superfund site we can create job 
      business opportunity and increase property value for 
      western north carolina and nationwide 


                      regulation back by science 

        as a small business owner i have experience the real life 
      consequence of new government regulation impose by 
      washington bureaucrat who do not understand the implication 
      of their misguided rule 
        the show i the science act that i introduce would require 
      federal agency to publish the datum that they use to inform 
      decision behind new rule if a federal agency can not prove 
      that the benefit of a new rule outweigh the cost then we 
      should not burden the american people and main street 
      business with unnecessary regulation 
        federal agency make legally bind requirement on the 
      public often with an inability or unwillingness to share the 
      information that they use to form the basis of their rule 
      and fail to calculate the cost and benefit of those rule 
      for american taxpayer 
        we need to fix how washington work by require more 
      transparency in federal rulemaking and improve 
      congressional and public oversight of the rulemaking process
