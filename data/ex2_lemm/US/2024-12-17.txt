                        tuesday december 

   mr. duncan mr. speaker i rise today to talk about a piece of 
 property in south central alaska know as the bering river coal field 
 locate in the magnificent copper river delta this issue go back to 
 the day of theodore roosevelt as a conservation effort 
   the united states government have the opportunity to purchase the 
 mineral right to this field 
   this congress provide the u.s. forest service $ to buy the 
 bering river coal field through the land and water conservation fund 
 but the appraisal come in at $ 
   the korean alaska development company that own it will sell for $ 
 and i want to thank a gentleman joe shinn and the kadco 
 board of director for stay at the table 
   we have an opportunity and i believe the member on both side of 
 the aisle would agree if you could by acclamation to give the forest 
 service the ability to purchase this remarkable property for 
 conservation but the united states government can not pay more than 
 appraise value unless we in congress authorize they to do that 
   the difference be between $ and $ dollar and i 
 ask my colleague if not now then in the future to help the united 
 states of america to set aside the bering river coal field in 
 perpetuity for all future generation to enjoy
