                         tuesday august 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i rise to introduce the district of 
 columbia electronic transmittal of legislation act which would permit 
 the chair of the council of the district of columbia to transmit 
 legislation to congress in the form of the chair&#x27;s choosing include 
 electronic form this bill would bring the congressional review process 
 for legislation enact by d.c. into the electronic age last congress 
 the committee on oversight and reform pass this bill 
   while i do not believe there should be a congressional review process 
 for d.c. legislation and i have introduce a bill to eliminate the 
 review process this bill would not change the review process except 
 that it would give d.c. flexibility in the form it transmit 
 legislation to congress this bill&#x27;s only purpose be to reduce 
 administrative burden on d.c. and congress 
   the d.c. home rule act require the chair of the d.c. council to 
 transmit legislation to 

 page e802 

 congress for a review period the legislation take effect upon the 
 expiration of the review period unless a resolution of disapproval be 
 enact into law during the review period the home rule act be silent 
 on the form of transmittal but congress have always require the 
 legislation to be physically transmit 
   electronic record be recognize as valid under federal and state 
 law and federal state and local government conduct official business 
 electronically for example under the electronic signatures in global 
 and national commerce act which be enact into law more than 
 year ago with respect to any interstate transaction in which the 
 party consent ` ` a signature contract or other record relate to 
 such transaction may not be deny legal effect validity or 
 enforceability solely because it be in electronic form.&#x27;&#x27 in the 
 e government act which facilitate the federal government provide 
 information and service to the public electronically be enact into 
 law 
   federal agency transmit regulation and other document to the 
 federal register electronically congress be also capable of conduct 
 official business electronically for example the house permit 
 member include act through their staff to introduce legislation 
 and submit statement into the congressional record electronically 
   the requirement that d.c. physically transmit legislation impose 
 cost on the council the council engage in a step process to 
 physically transmit legislation include print copy of each 
 bill and committee report arrange a time for delivery of these 
 document to the office of the speaker and president of the senate and 
 have staffer drive to the capitol to deliver the document 
 be necessary because of parking restriction 
   the physical transmittal process also impose cost on congress the 
 follow congressional office and committee be involve in the 
 physical transmittal process the office of the speaker and president 
 of the senate the house and senate parliamentarian the house clerk 
 the senate secretary the house committee on oversight and 
 accountability and the senate committee on homeland security and 
 governmental affairs 
   the aftermath of the january attack on the capitol 
 highlight the burden of physical transmittal after temporary 
 fencing be instal around the capitol d.c. employee could not 
 enter the capitol this delay transmittal of d.c. legislation until 
 council and congressional staff develop a workaround which consist 
 of staff meeting outside the fencing to transmit legislation 
   i recognize that congress require all so call executive 
 communication include d.c. legislation to be physically 
 transmit but d.c. be the only entity require to transmit 
 legislation to congress for a review period 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
