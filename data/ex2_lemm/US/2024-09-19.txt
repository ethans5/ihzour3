                       thursday september 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in opposition to this month 
 continuing resolution and the accompanying save act 
   most of we do not want a cr and it be deeply unfortunate that be 
 necessary once again the senate do not get its work do and fail 
 to pass any appropriations bill off the floor the house republican 
 majority waste month write bill load with extreme social policy 
 that the american people do not want and still republicans only 
 pass half their bill why because they be so unpopular with their 
 own conference 
   have fail to complete this work republicans now want to kick the 
 can for month they will waste half the fiscal year cost 
 taxpayer billion of dollar a cr this long would be irresponsible 
 the department of defense have also identify the consequence for our 
 national security a month cr would have negative impact on our 
 military personnel and their family it would not include fund to 
 cover the percent pay raise for service members it would not fund 
 the nearly $ increase require by law for the basic housing 
 allowance and it would not include fund need to cover medical cost 
 for military family and stabilize the military healthcare system 
   the services would not be able to offer new enlistment and 
 reenlistment bonus harm recruitment effort new program start 
 can&#x27;t happen under a cr this harm innovation and delay get 
 weapon and equipment into the hand of our personnel quickly keep 
 major defense program on time and on budget will be more difficult a 
 cr will delay multi year procurement of platform like heavy lift 
 helicopter and virginia class submarines it will pause investment in 
 our space base satellite architecture it will prevent full funding 
 for the columbia class submarine and delay procurement of the b-21 
 raider finally cr&#x27;s damage the readiness of the joint force training 
 exercise and operation that be need to ensure we can win any 
 fight they won&#x27;t happen 
   the navy will suffer a delay of ship maintenance availability 
 limit work for our public and private shipyard air force fly 
 hour weapon system sustainment and ground combat readiness will 
 suffer we know this to be true why 
   we just have a nearly month cr in fiscal year which impact 
 dod&#x27;s ability to budget appropriately the last thing we should do be 
 compound this problem we also have the fiscal responsibility act to 
 consider because if all appropriation bill be not enact by the 
 end of april sequestration take effect 
   what do that mean across the board spending cut impact 
 everything from national security to infrastructure to healthcare and 
 education that be a gamble none of we should want to take 
   to make a bad deal even bad the speaker have tack on a partisan 
 voter suppression tool know as the save act in an attempt to appease 
 his most extreme member if this bill become law the vast majority of 
 americans would need more than document to vote we need to be 
 remove barrier to the ballot box not add more the senate will 
 not pass this bill and it will not become law we should reject this 
 legislation pass a clean short term cr and roll up our sleeve and 
 get to work
