   introduction of the household goods shipping consumer protection act

                       of the district of columbia 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday may 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the household goods 
 shipping consumer protection act this bill would give the federal 
 motor carrier safety administration fmcsa more authority to protect 
 consumer from fraud in the interstate transportation of household 
 good specifically this bill would give fmcsa the authority to assess 
 civil penalty against unregistered shipper and against entity that 
 hold consumers&#x27 personal good hostage give fmcsa the express 
 authority to reimburse state for enforce federal consumer protection 
 law relate to the transportation of household good and establish 
 requirement to ensure that motor carrier broker and freight 
 forwarder that seek registration be operate legitimate business 
 representative mike ezell be co lead this bill with i 
   fmcsa receive thousand of complaint every year from americans who 
 be the victim of fraud in the shipment of household good fraudster 
 have launch move company with fake star online review to draw 
 in customer intend to overcharge customer or to hold their 
 personal good hostage until an additional fee be pay after receive 
 negative review fraudster open a new move company under a new name 
 and a new fmcsa license fmcsa lack the authority to prevent and 
 punish these type of fraud 
   in a department of transportation administrative law judge 
 alj rule that fmcsa lack authority to assess civil penalty for 
 violation of commercial regulation and registration requirement 
 include unauthorized brokerage and for failure to return household 
 good to consumer under current law as interpret by the alj&#x27;s 
 decision and final agency order fmcsa may not assess civil penalty 
 for violation of commercial regulation instead the department of 
 justice must initiate an action in federal court this bill would 
 reverse the alj&#x27;s decision and provide explicit authority for fmcsa to 
 adjudicate and assess civil penalty for unfair business practice and 
 consumer protection violation as well as give fmcsa authority to 
 enforce roadway safety regulation against fraudster 
   this bill would also provide explicit authority to fmcsa to withhold 
 registration from any applicant that fail to provide a valid principal 
 place of business or disclose common ownership with any other 
 register entity at the time of registration household good 
 carrier broker and freight forwarder have register 

 page e550 

 with address where no legitimate operation take place often 
 designate their official address as a retail package store vacant 
 parking lot or business address unrelated to the register entity 
 fmcsa already require motor carrier to designate a principal place of 
 business and disclose common ownership however fmcsa may only take 
 enforcement action after the entity be already register and refuse 
 to cooperate with investigation at the designated address 
   this bill would also permit state to use motor carrier safety 
 assistance program and high priority program funding to conduct 
 commercial regulatory and consumer protection standard review and 
 enforcement action against household good motor carrier broker and 
 freight forwarder it would also clarify that state may retain the 
 penalty and fine impose in proceeding relate to violation of 
 household good statute and regulation these provision would 
 support state in their effort to protect the american people from 
 predatory practice 
   i urge my colleague to support this bill
