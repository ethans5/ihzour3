      that obituary and the prayer card ever the fashion 
      statement wasn&#x27;t he with those bright pastel and those 
      shirt that be a reflection of his personality yesterday

      see old east hartford on display the outpour of love and

      appetite for a life well live 
        talk with several of you at the wake and over the past 
      few day about story of ray and what he would want this 
      service to be father i have to start with a disclaimer 
      here craig jordan kevin brown and numerous other want to 
      be clear that the funniest rammer story be not suitable 
      for church or in mixed company i think it&#x27;s safe to say he 
      be a guy&#x27;s guy 
        it be abundantly clear from all that he would want an 
      upbeat sendoff on his next journey and foremost and 
      most of all the share empathy respect and love for peg 
      and his angel noele kelly and melanie at the wake 
      it be hard view and watch they hold back the tear 
      the grieving and the mourning and with each person a memory 
      of a man whose action be big than life know even in 
      this difficult moment what ray would want be to celebrate 
      his journey and the relationship he share with all of you 
      i know i&#x27;m state the obvious as so many of you have speak 
      of his lifelong love and relationship with peg many of you 
      have attest that they be the quintessential couple they 
      simply go together well ray and peg peg and ray no 
      gathering be complete without they and you talk about 
      opposite yet there be a great bond that hold they 
      together certainly noele kelly and melanie but it be 
      their great faith and devotion to each other that always 
      resonate 
        many of you say ray be always there for you no matter 
      how trivial or important how many of you can recall be 
      with ray into the wee hour of the morning partake in the 
      elixir of life and thinking as i have there&#x27;s no way after 
      this that he get up and take peg to mass in the morning-- 
      only to be astonish again by he be there for she and 
      their faith dependable and rock solid that&#x27;s love and 
      devotion that&#x27;s ray and peg 
        comradery be a great term about a gathering of friend and 
      as nick olivia point out with ray those gathering be 
      always punctuate by have fun and enjoy another&#x27;s 
      company whether at the hose club the dirty dozen the f&amp;l 
      dinners or innumerable political event ray and a good time 
      be synonymous he be always a doer never a complainer and 
      put everyone else his last trip to ireland be an epic 
      example a trip he have plan for some time with nick and 
      vita bruce and wendy and he and peg as bruce recall 
      week before he have terrible and severe back pain and be 
      not feel well but would not let his health stand in the 
      way of a great trip with friend while i&#x27;m sure the guiness 
      help everyone know he be in pain but he do it because 
      of who he be and the people he care about that&#x27;s ray 
        as my brother danny say have work with ray on 
      build the house and you hear father say how he do it 
      with his own hand ray have many skill among his 
      specialty be electrical with a minor in procurement if 
      we need hardware nut bolt nail screw blade zip 
      tie glove paint or whatever ray always manage to come 
      up with a donor and keep we go my brother go on to 
      describe his essence say what i believe everyone in this 
      room agree with he be the most dependable friend you could 
      have on the site and there till the end and the 
      job be do he have a broad base knowledge and a hand on

      help everyone else he be practical and direct and always 
      with an informed view 
        now most here assemble know ray be the master of the 
      power nap from which virtually in any environment he could 
      fall into a deep sleep and awake and rally 

 page e230 

      danny delmastro of course cite the good example of his 
      capability at the annual aero med christmas party when about 
      quarter the way through a great evening rammer say 
      to danny he&#x27;s go to ` ` step outside for a smoke.&#x27;&#x27 danny 
      look at he and say ` ` it&#x27;s snowing,&#x27;&#x27 ray just nod and 
      about an hour later with the place close down and everyone 
      look for ray danny go outside and find he on a bench 
      with about inch of snow on his head and his shoulder 
      and say ` ` rammer!&#x27;&#x27 and ray respond without miss a 
      beat that ` ` yes i&#x27;ll have a final final.&#x27;&#x27 that be our guy 
        he clearly be a giant of a man jim iacobellis note that 
      he say he have a giant talent he could do anything he put 
      his mind to he have giant knowledge he know so much about so 
      much and if he didn&#x27;t he&#x27;d ask and inquire until he do he 
      have a giant personality the life and center of any 
      gathering you always want to be around he and talk to 
      he he be a giant friend he have so many and he know they 
      he know what they like and know what make they happy or 
      unhappy he be also the to accept new people and

      curiosity his inquisitive and honest and practical advice

      the rammer

   ms. mccollum mr. chair i rise in opposition to h.r. the 
 expand access to capital act mr. chair this bill do not in fact 
 expand access to capital it expand access to fraud 
   historically u.s. capital market have be successful because of 
 the transparency accountability and oversight require by 
 regulation investor both here and abroad have confidence in the 
 investment they make because they know company be require to be 
 transparent and the securities and exchange commission sec be 
 obligate to perform oversight however large company be now use 
 exemption design for small business this have result in an 
 expansion of the private security market which be risky than the 
 public security market because there be few and in some case no 
 disclosure require h.r. would exacerbate these problem by 
 allow large company to evade disclosure requirement and sec 
 oversight the bill also reduce incentive for company to go public 
 through an initial public offering ipo which will deprive investor 
 include work family and retiree of transparent investment 
 opportunity 
   everyday americans invest their hard earn money to save for their 
 education travel buy a home and retirement h.r. threaten 
 the exist regulation that protect everyday americans from risky 
 investment that would put their livelihood in jeopardy under current 
 regulation financial professional or company be require to only 
 sell private security to investor who have access to reliable 
 information have a demonstrate ability to understand the risk and 
 have the financial wherewithal to absorb potentially severe investment 
 loss h.r. remove these safeguard allow financial 
 middleman to peddle risky private security to unsuspecting hard- 
 work americans h.r. set everyday american investor up to 
 fail 
   h.r. also include anti worker provision that will harm gig- 
 worker like rideshare driver food delivery provider and on demand 
 caregiver the state of minnesota have be work hard to prevent the 
 misclassification of gig worker worker as independent contractor and 
 provide strong protection for these worker h.r. would preempt 
 these effort in minnesota and around the country by prohibit the 
 classification of gig worker as employee this provision would cut 
 off gig workers&#x27 access to essential state base right and benefit 
 like a minimum wage unemployment insurance overtime pay health 
 benefit and worker compensation 
   mr. chair h.r. eliminate crucial investor protection which 
 would expose the investment of american family and senior to 
 financial fraud i urge my colleague to oppose the bill
