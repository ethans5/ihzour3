 economy they account for third of net new job and nearly half of 
 our u.s. economic activity 
   for many of they that dream stall with go to a bank and get 
 a small business loan for many americans the sound of their name the 
 color of their skin the language that they speak or who they love can 
 doom that dream if a bank say that they be at risk 
   this isn&#x27;t hypothetical i too be bear and raise in south texas 
 i can tell you that when i go home and i see some business that have 
 close i ask my family whether it be due to the pandemic or no 
 demand for the 

 page e1201 

 cost of service that they have i be tell that they just have trouble 
 with finance and they couldn&#x27;t get a loan 
   in some small rural area like where i grow up there aren&#x27;t credit 
 union everywhere like there be in the city of houston where i live 
 now 
   even in the city of houston many small business during the 
 pandemic couldn&#x27;t secure a ppp loan in round we as congress have 
 to go in and do a carve out to literally force the bank to provide 
 loan to small business 
   i be glad that of my colleague be openhearte and give people a

   minority entrepreneurs struggle to get small business relief loans 

                            by stacy cowley 

        a year after the paycheck protection program start 
      study show how its design hurt black- and other minority- 
      own business 
        southern bancorp be a lender serve the arkansas and 
      mississippi delta where poverty rate be among the high 
      in america and decade of redline shape neighborhood with 
      little generational wealth 
        when the paycheck protection program for small business 
      start last april so many of southern bancorp&#x27;s customer 
      didn&#x27;t qualify for the relief money that the arkansas bank&#x27;s 
      chief executive darrin williams turn to donor to raise 
      money for $ grant so it wouldn&#x27;t have to turn 
      applicant away empty handed 
        the bank make such grant give more than of they 
      to business run by woman or minority owner let a nail 
      salon owner buy plexiglass so she could reopen another 
      allow a small cafe to buy safety gear for its staff a day 
      care use the money for the new sanitize equipment it 
      need 
        ` ` so many company will never come back and 
      disproportionately more of those that will be lose be black 
      and brown businesses,&#x27;&#x27 mr. williams say 
        congress create the paycheck protection program in march 
      as an emergency stopgap for what lawmaker expect to 
      be a few month of sharp economic disruption but as the 
      pandemic rag on the program which make its loan 
      year ago this past week have turn into the large 
      small business support program in american history send 
      $ in forgivable loan to struggle company 
        the program help nearly business retain 
      worker but it have also be plague by complex change 
      rule at every stage of its existence and year in it 
      have become clear that the program&#x27;s hasty rollout and design 
      hurt some of the most vulnerable business 
        a new york times analysis of datum from several sources-- 
      include the small business administration which be 
      manage the loan program and interview with dozen of 
      small business and banker show that black- and other 
      minority own business be disproportionately underserve 
      by the relief effort often because they lack the 
      connection to get access to the aid or be reject because 
      of the program&#x27;s rule 


                            rollout be speedy 

        after congress create the program in last year&#x27;s cares 
      act president donald j. trump&#x27;s administration especially 
      his treasury secretary steven mnuchin put a priority on 
      get money to needy business fast just day after 
      the law be sign the early applicant receive their 
      check 
        but the haste mean the rule be mostly write on the 
      fly reach hard to serve business be an afterthought 
      lender and advocacy group warn that the relief effort have 
      structural challenge that be likely to inadvertently but 
      disproportionately harm woman and minority business owner 
      reach the most vulnerable business require 
      determination they say and the program give lender no 
      incentive to put in that effort 
        the government rely on bank to make the loan create 
      an obstacle for borrower who didn&#x27;t have establish banking 
      relationship some bank favor their large and wealthy 
      client which push ordinary customer to the back of the 
      queue ` ` mystery shopper&#x27;&#x27 study find that black 
      applicant be consistently treat bad than white 
      counterpart 
        the program also largely lock out sole proprietor and 
      independent contractor of the most popular structure 
      for minority own business those company weren&#x27;t 
      eligible to apply for the program&#x27;s week when they get 
      access a rule bar loan to unprofitable solo 
      business a restriction that didn&#x27;t apply to large 
      company prevent many from get help most nonbank 
      lender include those that specialize in underserved 
      community be shut out for week while they wait for 
      the small business administration to approve they 
        ` ` the focus at the outset be on speed and it come at the 
      expense of equity,&#x27;&#x27 say ashley harrington the federal 
      advocacy director at the center for responsible lending 
        in the program&#x27;s final week it be schedule to stop 
      take application on may -president biden&#x27;s 
      administration have try to alter its trajectory with rule 
      change intend to funnel more money toward women- and 
      minority lead business especially those with only a handful 
      of employee 
        mr. biden take a swipe at his predecessor&#x27;s track record 
      last week as he sign a bill extend the program&#x27;s 
      deadline ` ` many small business as you know particularly 
      hispanic as well as african american small business be 
      just out of business because they get bypass the time 
      around,&#x27;&#x27 the president say 
        but mr. biden&#x27;s revision which most prominently 
      expand lending to independent contractor and other who 
      work for themselves have run into their own obstacle 
      include the speed with which they be rush through 
      lender catch off guard struggle to carry they out with 
      little time leave before the deadline 
        ` ` the rule be complicated and constantly change and 
      that alone create an access barrier,&#x27;&#x27 randell leach the

        because lender be not require to collect demographic 
      detail on their borrower datum on the paycheck protection 
      program&#x27;s racial breakdown have be scarce but economist 
      have consistently find sign of gap 
        an analysis by the federal reserve bank of new york note 
      that some county with large number of black own 
      business most notably the bronx queens and wayne county 
      mich. which include detroit have strikingly low 
      concentration of the relief loan majority white zip code 
      in several metropolitan area have high loan coverage than 
      zip code with heavily minority population accord to a 
      san francisco fed analysis release last month 
        and datum from the small business administration show the 
      relief effort&#x27;s tilt the vast majority of lender do not 
      report demographic datum on the loan they make

      finally find a local bank that would process her loan 
        she&#x27;s grateful for the aid which help she hold on to

   mr. garamendi mr. speaker i be thrill to co sponsor the 
 ` ` renewable fuel for ocean go vessels act&#x27;&#x27 h.r. with 
 representatives mariannette miller meeks r ia01 nikki budzinski d- 
 il13 and carlos a. gimenez r fl28 this bipartisan bill would make 
 maritime biofuel fully eligible under the u.s. environmental protection 
 agency&#x27;s usepa renewable fuel standard which currently only apply 
 to biofuel for motor vehicle airplane locomotive and in limited 
 circumstance recreational boating or vessel on inland waterway 
   under the energy policy act of public law congress 
 authorize the federal renewable fuel standard rfs which work to 
 simultaneously reduce transportation relate emission from fossil 
 fuel and support domestic agriculture forestry and biofuel 
 manufacturing however current law exclude otherwise eligible 
 biofuel for ocean go vessel no rationale be ever provide for 
 this exclusion in the congressional hearing record or committee report 
 for the and energy bills 
   this arbitrary counterproductive exclusion deny the burgeon 
 advanced biofuel and renewable natural gas industry in the united 
 states important maritime customer our bipartisan bill would fix this 
 problem by simply strike the exclusion allow domestic biofuel 
 producer to obtain an rfs credit for sell to customer in the jones 
 act and global maritime industry the united states navy have even 
 seek to use renewable maritime fuel but have so far be stymie as 
 domestic blender simply do not make renewable maritime fuel because of 
 this unnecessary exclusion 
   to be clear although modern engine for large vessel be 
 increasingly capable of burn advanced biofuel instead of heavy 
 bunker fossil fuel our bipartisan bill would not require the use of 
 renewable fuel in all ocean go vessel instead our bill would 
 merely expand the potential market for biofuel and remove a statutory 
 disincentive for develop renewable maritime fuel 
   accord to the usepa&#x27;s inventory of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions 
 and sinks from to the transportation sector account for 
 approximately percent of greenhouse gas emission nationally the 
 large of any economic sector tackle the climate crisis require 
 every industry to transition to clean renewable fuel include the 
 international ocean shipping and cruise industry in july the 
 united nations international maritime organization imo adopt new 
 global standard to reduce greenhouse gas emission from commercial 
 cargo vessel and cruise ship our bipartisan ` ` renewable fuel for 
 ocean go vessels act&#x27;&#x27 h.r. would support the global maritime 
 industry&#x27;s transition to alternative fuel like advanced biofuel and 
 renewable natural gas from methane capture 
   mr. speaker the federal renewable fuel standard&#x27;s exclusion of fuel 
 for ocean go vessel without any stated rationale have create 
 unnecessary regulatory complexity hinder the advanced biofuel and 
 renewable natural gas industry and undermine the global effort to 
 reduce maritime emission i encourage all member of congress to join 
 i in remove this outdated restriction by cosponsor our bipartisan 
 the ` ` renewable fuel for ocean go vessels act&#x27;&#x27 h.r.
