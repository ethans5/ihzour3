         rethink america&#x27;s nuclear posture a question of why 

                                  
                                 

                           hon john garamendi 

                              of california 

                     in the house of representative 

                         tuesday august 

   mr. garamendi mr. speaker today i rise to address the future of 
 our nuclear posture 
   in ronald reagan and gorbachev cold warrior at the head 
 of the world&#x27;s large nuclear arsenal declare that nuclear war 
 can not be win and must never be fight that declaration be regularly 
 repeat and reaffirm by the leader of all nuclear weapon 
 states in this recognition should be the start and end of every 
 conversation on nuclear weapon 
   nevertheless nuclear power since the advent of the cold war 
 instead seem to have conclude that deterrence require more nuclear 
 weapon of every kind than the adversary today because of this logic 
 we find ourselves engage in a way nuclear arm race with russia 
 china and the u.s. each blame the other for start it and 
 continue it each nation fear an adversary may outflank they 
 continue to build nuclear infrastructure nuclear silos in china&#x27;s 
 western desert nuclear weapon on satellite and replacement icbm 
 as each nation seek to strengthen its own hand on and on it go 
 a constant buildup where a country ask ` ` how can we build faster?&#x27;&#x27 
 or ` ` what can we target&#x27;&#x27 but ignore the most important question why 
   leadership require the rigorous use of that letter word 
 ` ` why.&#x27;&#x27 we must avoid blind adherence to yesterday&#x27;s decision in 
 today&#x27;s discussion that mean ask what be sufficient for nuclear 
 deterrence look at past strategy and rely on past assumption 
 isn&#x27;t enough old cold war mentality will create unacceptable cost 
 rob we of alternative and place we in even great danger instead 
 we must think boldly and not repeat the problem of our history 
   with this in mind i bring this question of ` ` why&#x27;&#x27 to we all 
   i know full well that we face a hostile world with numerous 
 aggressive adversary we also know that we be now engage in a 
 nuclear arm race with china and russia other nation be also know 
 to have nuclear weapon and other seek they in this dangerous 
 environment deterrence must consider far more than just a great power 
 nuclear exchange 
   we have also see the threat to use nuclear weapon to deter non- 
 nuclear aggression putin have use irresponsible nuclear threat to try 
 and prevent our support for the ukrainian people in the defense of 
 their country 
   of course no have yet use these weapon a fact that i know we 
 be all grateful for but with every threat come the risk of use no 
 matter who have they the prevalence of nuclear weapon place the world 
 at risk today we must think not just in term of the threat but also 
 in term of the future 
   so let we ask a foundational question why do america need nuclear 
 weapon if it do how many and what kind proponent often justify 
 nuclear weapon for reason to deter and fight a strategic 
 nuclear exchange between major power and to deter non nuclear 
 aggression 
   focus on the category deter an opponent from use 
 strategic and tactical nuclear weapon history would indicate that the 
 strategy have work for more than year but that record 
 understate how close we come to cause our own destruction several 
 near disastrous incident motivate leader to back away and undertake 
 several treaty to reduce weapon and risk leader like reagan jfk 
 eisenhower carter and obama know that nuclear weapon could end 
 civilization and with those heavy moral and ethical consideration in 
 mind negotiate significant safety measure and a serious reduction in 
 nuclear weapon 
   these leader demonstrate vision and commitment they know that war 
 be not an option so they have to create a vision for a safe future 
 unfortunately too many today shrug their shoulder and say the time 
 for negation be not now which bring we to yet another question why 
 not try over the next year we will spend almost 
 dollar on our nuclear weapon what if we spend just on diplomatic 
 and risk reduction effort 
   the category of limit non nuclear aggression carry its 
 own risk proponent of use nuclear weapon suggest that we could 
 use ` ` tactical weapons&#x27;&#x27 in some limited way however once a nuclear 
 option start when and how do a tactical exchange proceed in the 
 chaos and fog of war would this tactical nuclear option just open the 
 way to full scale devastation many ` ` think tanks&#x27;&#x27 have study this 
 and to this day the result be ` ` do not open pandora&#x27;s box.&#x27;&#x27 
   despite their limitation both category be also how we continue 
 to justify our spending on our massive nuclear arsenal some even use 
 they to justify large and large expense but this bring we to 
 another why question why have we choose to spend our defense dollar 
 on modernize every element in the current nuclear system 
   this question will become increasingly important as timeline slip 
 and cost grow in our nuclear modernization program for example 
 fresh off its nunn mccurdy review the sentinel program will now 
 cost at least $ not include a new bomb for another $ 
 or the unknown cost of plutonium pit production 
   we have an obligation to ask why not only ` why the extraordinary 
 cost increases&#x27 but far more importantly why be we do the 
 sentinel program at all be there no alternative that would deter 
 adversary more effectively 
   history be an important guide in this matter in the 1950 and 1960 
 our nuclear enterprise develop ground base icbm and we have 
 continue they through the year today member of congress without 
 scrutiny repeat a mantra that ground base icbm be necessary 
 but year after the advent of the ssbn and year after stealth 
 bomber why be these ground base icbm necessary these missile sit 
 in their silo not too far from you in the heart of america whose 
 location be know to cow hand sheepherder and target personnel 
 in the bunker of our adversary 
   if in a nuclear crisis adversary choose to target out missile 
 field they will launch early 

 page e849 

 to destroy those missile whose location be know thus the mmiii 
 and the sentinel create an extraordinarily dangerous situation in the 
 event of a perceive attack there would be immense pressure on the 
 president to make the decision to launch within minute or risk lose 
 the missile 
   with all this in mind why spend such a massive amount of money on a 
 system that be so vulnerable and so extraordinarily dangerous in 
 defense policy nothing should be sacred or untouchable and everything 
 should require frequent re evaluation so let we not be afraid to ask 
 yet another question why a triad strategy can not afford to be 
 stagnant it can not afford to complacently accept the assumption of 
 the past 
   we must ask why we need the ground leg of the triad if the nuclear 
 program be for deterrence be the firepower of the submarine 
 airplane and their missile sufficient to dissuade an adversary 
 these system have the benefit of stealth and the president have the 
 time to gather all information and then decide whether to use the 
 nuclear response if that be not enough we also have conventional 
 weapon that can deter adversary 
   but even if we do retain each leg we must reevaluate what&#x27;s truly 
 necessary within each we do not have infinite resource and must make 
 difficult choice about where we allocate our national resource as we 
 rethink whether we can achieve deterrence with different mix let&#x27;s 
 prioritize safety and effectiveness over fulfil antiquated 
 assumption or requirement remember this be not just a matter of 
 match our capability to their capability this be about what will 
 ensure our future survival 
   too often debate on deterrence do not consider the rapidly change 
 security environment cyber warfare uncertainty confusion and 
 misunderstanding could be great risk than aggression we be heavily 
 dependent on our space observation and communication system and now 
 we know that space war be real and routinely discuss how do we weigh 
 those risk when we decide to continue to keep sentinel or mmiii 
 missile each prepare to kill million on constant alert ready for 
 immediate launch in just a few moment when there will certainly be 
 chaos and uncertainty 
   surely more destructive capability be not always well so why do 
 we need so many consider how many weapon will deter conflict be 
 not just a military problem of tit for tat calculation what national 
 victory could we or just as important our adversary ever hope to 
 achieve at the end of a nuclear war that inevitably kill hundred of 
 million of people include ten of million of americans destroy 
 entire city and endanger the environment of the planet 
   as we think about deterrence in the modern era it be clear from 
 rise cost and the existential danger that we can not afford a new 
 arm race of course we must grapple with hard question about how to 
 deter dangerous adversary still we must answer an even hard 
 question how do we deter in a way that ensure there be a tomorrow 
 worth protect must we continue a year old triad strategy without 
 consider the alternative why why be we stick in a logic silo 
 with the blast door close 
   i want to end this with a discussion i have with the captain of a 
 united kingdom nuclear armed submarine after tour his ship i 
 stop at the foot of the ladder to thank he for the discussion i 
 say ` ` i appreciate the enormous responsibility and difficult task that 
 you have if you receive a message to launch your missile and you do 
 what do you do next go home?&#x27;&#x27 i&#x27;ll never forget the look on his face 
 i don&#x27;t know if he have ever contemplate that question but that&#x27;s a
