                               of wisconsin 

                     in the house of representative 

                         wednesday june 

   ms. moore of wisconsin mr. chair i rise today in support of my 
 amendment no -which have be include in the en bloc amendment to 
 help ensure that the u.s. remain focused on help to end female 
 genital mutilation around the world at a time when some country be 
 consider repeal exist ban 
   female genital mutilation fgm involve procedure that alter or 
 injure the female genitalia for non medical reason and be recognize 
 internationally as a violation of the human right of girl and woman 
   as the person who lead effort to outlaw female genital mutilation in 
 the state of wisconsin i be too keenly aware that this remain a 
 press issue 
   more than girl and woman alive today have undergo 
 female genital mutilation and it be estimate that girl 
 be at risk of experience this harmful practice this year alone 
   this be a practice that have no health benefit but harm girl and 
 woman 
   i share concern that have be raise about the overall funding 
 level in this bill that have be so well articulated and the deep 
 cut to a range of program that be vital to our nation&#x27;s interest and 
 national security effort 
   i be also trouble by a number of policy rider that have be 
 insert into this bill the bill defund agency like the un 
 children&#x27;s fund unicef that have be work to address female 
 genital mutilation for year agency like the united nations 
 population fund unfpa that have also be engage in help to move 
 the world towards the elimination of this practice the department of 
 state have annually provide about $ to unicef to support a 
 joint programme on the elimination of female genital mutilation 
   while we have not yet eliminate the practice of fgm our investment 
 and those of our international partner have see result as note by 
 the un over the last decade the prevalence of fgm have decline 
 globally 
   it wasn&#x27;t by accident 
   it take hard work by dedicated partner at all level from the 
 international community to the local community work to reframe law 
 and attitude 
   but the work must continue 
   for example the parliament in the gambia be consider repeal 
 the fgm ban enact in that country in 
   the repeal campaign begin after the government dare to actually 
 enforce the law a few year ago 
   overall there be concern that if the gambia repeal its law this 
 could inspire other country to do likewise 
   but more importantly be what it would mean for the woman and girl 
 in gambia where some estimate that up to quarter of the woman 
 and girl have undergo the procedure 
   in february of this year when the world commemorate the 
 international day of tolerance for female genital mutilation our 
 secretary of state antony blinken say ` ` fgm in all form be a human 
 right abuse that harm all women.&#x27;&#x27 
   we can not rollback the u.s. commitment to end this human right 
 abuse and that include ensure that we adequately fund these effort 
   our commitment to eliminate fgm work with international 
 organization such as unicef and unfpa country survivor and 
 other stakeholder will only go as deep as our resource take it my 
 amendment would send a message that we still think this be important 
 even in a bill that make harmful cut across the board to development 
 diplomacy and humanitarian assistance 
   i urge support
