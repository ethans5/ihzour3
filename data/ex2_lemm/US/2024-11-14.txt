                               of minnesota 

                     in the house of representative 

                        tuesday november 

   ms. mccollum mr. speaker i rise in opposition to h.r. the 
 stop terror financing and tax penalties on american hostages act 
   this legislation would grant the secretary of the treasury the 
 unilateral authority to suspend the tax exempt status of any 
 organization deem ` ` terrorist supporting&#x27;&#x27 without due process or 
 evidence u.s. law already prohibit nonprofit from provide material 
 support to terrorist additionally i be deeply concerned about how 
 this legislation could provide president elect trump&#x27;s incoming 
 administration with unchecked power to cause irreparable damage to any 
 nonprofit he deem a threat to his own political agenda this could be 
 disastrous for nonprofit across the country include those do 
 important work in the district like springboard for the arts 
 the playwrights&#x27 center and the center for victims of torture more 
 than civil society group include the aclu the american 
 federation of teachers the naacp and the league of conservation 
 voters sign a letter oppose this bill due to the potential for 
 abuse i include in the record this letter i stand with they and i 
 encourage my colleague to do the same 
                                                september 
      hon mike johnson 
      speaker house of representatives 
      washington dc 
      hon hakeem jeffries 
      democratic leader house of representatives 
      washington dc 
        dear speaker johnson and leader jeffries we write to 
      express our deep concern with h.r. the stop terror- 
      financing and tax penalties on american hostages act 
      specifically this bill include the text of h.r. 
      legislation we strongly oppose as it raise significant 
      constitutional concern because h.r. vest vast 
      unilateral discretion in the secretary of treasury it 
      create a high risk of politicized and discriminatory 
      enforcement the executive branch already have extensive 
      authority to prohibit transaction with individual and 
      entity it deem connect to terrorism and nonprofit 
      organization be already prohibit from provide material 
      support to terrorist organization in fact it would be a 
      federal crime for they to do so 
        moreover we do not oppose the provision in h.r. that 
      relate to prevent the irs from impose fine and 
      penalty on hostage while they be hold abroad indeed 
      these provision have already pass the senate on their own 
      and if the house of representatives be to pass a version of 
      this bill that do not include the text of h.r. it 
      could be send immediately to the president for his signature 
        without any evidence as to the need for this legislation 
      h.r. authorize broad and easily abuse new power for 
      the executive branch it grant the secretary of the treasury 
      virtually unfettered discretion to designate a u.s. nonprofit 
      as a ` ` terrorist support organization&#x27;&#x27 and to strip it of 
      its tax exempt status if the secretary find that the 
      nonprofit have provide material support to a terrorist group 
      even if the ` ` support&#x27;&#x27 be not intentional or connect to 
      actual violence 
        while the sponsor of this legislation have state that it 
      be need to avoid what they refer to as ` ` time consume 
      bureaucratic process&#x27;&#x27 under current law what the bill 
      sponsor be actually seek to avoid be fundamental due 
      process if this bill be to become law the secretary of 
      treasury could strip a us nonprofit of its tax exempt status 
      without provide the nonprofit a meaningful opportunity to 
      defend itself before a neutral decisionmaker the legislation 
      far do not require disclosure of all the reason for 
      such a decision or the evidence rely upon to support it 
      nor would the government be require to provide any evidence 
      in its possession that might undermine its decision leave 
      an accuse nonprofit entirely in the dark about what conduct 
      the government believe qualifie as material support 
        the potential for abuse under h.r. be immense as the 
      executive branch would be hand a tool it could use to curb 
      free speech censor nonprofit medium outlet target political 
      opponent and punish disfavor group across the political 
      spectrum moreover the addition of this authority to the tax 
      code would allow the irs to explicitly target and harass 
      domestic nonprofit use its investigative authority it be 
      also not hard to imagine a future administration use this 
      power in far broad circumstance that have nothing to do 
      with the 

 page e1142 

      hostility in gaza and as more recent congressional 
      oversight effort make clear these effort be part of 
      concert attack on civil society that be target at more 
      than just group involve in the campus protest regard 
      gaza the executive branch could use this authority to target 
      its political opponent and use the fear of crippling legal 
      fee the stigma of the designation and donor flee 
      controversy to stifle dissent and chill speech and advocacy 
      and while the broad application of this authority may not 
      ultimately hold up in court the potential reputational and 
      financial cost of fend off an investigation and litigate 
      a wrongful designation could functionally mean the end of a 
      target nonprofit before it ever have its day in court 
        the lack of guardrail create the potential for future 
      administration to weaponize these power against group on 
      both end of the ideological spectrum even if they may never 
      be designate as ` ` terrorist supporting,&#x27;&#x27 let alone charge 
      with a crime nonprofit will curtail their activity as a 
      precaution in order to avoid stigmatize and financially 
      devastating punishment that be why we strongly urge you to 
      oppose the inclusion of h.r. in h.r.
