            value truth ` fullness&#x27 lesson from jury trial

                               of maryland 

                     in the house of representative 

                         thursday april 

   mr. raskin mr. speaker i rise today to reflect on the profound 
 responsibility that accompany public service 
   as public official across the country be swear into office each 
 affirm a commitment to faithfully execute the duty of public office 
 and defend the constitution of the united states but more and more 
 americans be lose faith that the action of our public official be 
 principally guide by our constitution and our law and some of my 
 colleague even doubt whether truth exist and whether government can 
 operate on the basis of mutually agree fact such as who win an 
 election 
   gregory mize a georgetown university law professor and retired trial 
 judge offer a compelling perspective we can use jury trial as 
 model for attain high level of truthfulness and reliable 
 outcome in government after all our whole justice system be base on 
 the idea that we must all tell the truth and the fact finder can decide 
 ` ` beyond a reasonable doubt&#x27;&#x27 or ` ` by preponderance of the evidence&#x27;&#x27 
 what actually happen 
   thomas jefferson say ` ` i consider trial by jury as the only anchor 
 yet ever imagine by man by which a government can be hold to the 
 principle of its constitution.&#x27;&#x27 indeed the way a courtroom pursue 
 truth provide a blueprint for encourage trustworthiness in our 
 public servant 
   at the beginning of jury selection potential juror take a solemn 
 oath to truthfully answer question pose by the judge and lawyer the 
 select juror take a oath to ` ` faithfully discharge the duty 
 of a juror and a true verdict render accord to the law and the 
 evidence.&#x27;&#x27 when testimony begin juror observe each witness take an 
 oath under penalty of perjury to ` ` tell the truth and nothing but the 
 truth.&#x27;&#x27 judge also swear to follow the law enforce rule of 
 evidence include by strike irrelevant or unreliable testimony from 
 consideration by the jury in some case judge must also pre qualify 
 propose expert before they can state an opinion on a key issue a 
 lawyer&#x27;s question then far test the reliability of those 
 opinion thank to these establish procedure juror learn the 
 court&#x27;s high valuation of honesty and come to expect it from their 
 government 
   rather than rely on a single rob jurist to render a final 
 verdict our founder want a panel of common citizen to administer 
 justice in honest dialogue with another they believe jury 
 deliberation to be a gold standard for reach truth and achieve 
 just end 
   after hear evidence and receive legal instruction from the 
 judge juror enter a deliberation room they test another&#x27;s 
 recollection and assumption and assess witness credibility study 
 show that during deliberation a jury police itself individual 
 juror remind other of the obligation of their oath and the 
 requirement of the law as state by the judge 
   as a new year with a new congress and president be underway it be 
 high time to bring courtroom reverence for truth telling into the 
 government generally and the public square as citizen we must demand 
 a commitment to the pursuit of truth from all of our public official 
 while enforce oath of office be a big challenge citizen must 
 demand truth from public official in all that we do and as public 
 official we must earn that trust by honor our oath 
   the work of judge gregory mize be exemplary in call america back 
 to the bedrock quest for truth we owe he a debt of gratitude
