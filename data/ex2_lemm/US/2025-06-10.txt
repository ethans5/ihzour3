      of information by limit view or regularly misrepresent 
      or ignore they 
        if the media be a drive force behind division it must

          myth buster ms-13 gang member of ` ` maryland father&#x27;&#x27 

        there be folk who have be up in arm about an ms-13 
      gang member whom some have dub as a ` ` maryland man,&#x27;&#x27 
      claim that he have be ` ` mistakenly&#x27;&#x27 deport to el 
      salvador 
        let&#x27;s be clear deport he be not a mistake 
        there have be a deportation order for abrego garcia since 
      when an immigration court and an appellate immigration 
      court both rule that he be a member of ms-13 and in our 
      country illegally 
        when ms-13 be declare a foreign terrorist organization 
      abrego garcia become no long eligible for any form of 
      immigration relief in our country 
        this be just another example of hand pick information 
      errantly fuel public outrage not only should journalistic 
      institution prioritize factual balanced reporting over 
      sensationalism but we as citizen must also take 
      responsibility for look at the fact rather than 
      retreat into ideological bubble 


             protect consumer choice from radical mandate 

        you may have hear of california&#x27;s electric vehicle ev 
      mandate to ban the sale of gas power car which be the 
      late attempt to force an extreme agenda that would take 
      away consumer choice lead to high price for both new and 
      use car and strain our electric grid 
        such a ban would affect consumer in every state in our 
      country by raise cost and decrease availability of gas 
      vehicle 
        the assertion that ev be affordable and highly seek 
      after be out of touch with reality only percent of 
      register vehicle in the u.s. be ev&#x27;s 
        i vote for resolution that pass the house to push 
      back on such radical policy from the prior administration 
      and repeal these disastrous mandate 
        house joint resolution would repeal california&#x27;s waiver 
      allow the state to ban the sale of gas power vehicle by 
      
        house joint resolution would repeal california&#x27;s waiver 
      allow the state to require the sale of emission 
      truck 
        house joint resolution would end california&#x27;s nitrogen 
      oxide engine emission standard which create unrealistic 
      standard for heavy duty on road engine 
        the u.s. have reduce emission for decade through wise 
      investment and innovation not extreme government mandate 
      congress must protect consumer choice and stop california 
      from circumvent the federal government&#x27;s environmental 
      regulation to the detriment of consumer and the automobile 
      market nationwide
