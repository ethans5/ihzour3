   ms. delauro mr. speaker i rise today to defend medicaid and the 
 supplemental nutrition assistance program or food stamp from an 
 ongoing republican assault 
   in a few hour republicans will meet to advance a bill that abandon 
 americans who be struggle with the cost of living crisis it gut 
 medicaid which cover health care for child people with 
 disability senior and low income worker and it cut nearly $ 
 from agriculture and program that combat hunger include 
 food stamp 
   this republican bill cut medicaid force state to pay more or 
 cover few people it cut benefit 
   i think of the people in connecticut include 
 child who can eat thank to food stamp 
   if this program be push back to the state who have few 
 resource the child will go hungry and their family will not be 
 able to afford healthy food in this cost of living crisis the last 
 thing we should be do be make it hard for family to put food 
 on the table but that be exactly what republicans be prepare to do 
 the result will be devastating the large cut to the most successful 
 anti hunger program in american history all to pay for massive 
 giveaway to billionaire
