                               of new york 

                     in the house of representative 

                       wednesday october 

   mr. nadler mr. speaker i rise today to commemorate october as 
 national spina bifida awareness month to recognize the approximately 
 americans live with this condition and to draw attention to 
 the critical challenge we must address to ensure that each and every 
 of these individual can achieve their full human potential and 
 have the quality of life they deserve 
   accord to the spina bifida association of america spina bifida be 
 the most common permanently disable birth defect compatible with 
 life literally translate as ` ` split spine,&#x27;&#x27 spina bifida occur when 
 a baby&#x27;s neural tube fail to develop or close properly typically 
 occur within the day of pregnancy while the neural tube 
 be form spina bifida often develop before a woman even know she 
 be pregnant 
   child bear with spina bifida typically undergo dozen of surgery 
 before they reach the age of and during their lifetime someone 
 with spina bifida will face at least a $ in medical expense 
 include multiple surgery 
   despite these challenge and thank to advance in research and 
 medicine along with policy supportive of child with this 
 condition nearly third of americans currently live with spina 
 bifida have make it to adulthood and while these stride be certainly 
 worth celebrate people with spina bifida particularly adults-- 
 continue to face a crisis of care that could be largely prevent with 
 the right resource and policy 
   while we have a coordinate system of care design to treat child 
 with spina bifida in the u.s. there be no equivalent for adult the 
 result be that adult face a ` ` care cliff&#x27;&#x27 and enter a very fractured 
 medical system where they be unable to find physician willing or even 
 knowledgeable enough to provide treatment as spina bifida be stil 
 largely teach in medical school as a pediatric condition and 
 education have fail to keep pace with the rapid rise in the adult 
 spina bifida population thousand of adult be leave with few option 
 other than to seek care in the emergency room or continue to see their 
 pediatric care team until insurance will no long cover their care 
 because of their age and to make matter bad many of these adult 
 rely on medicaid as their insurance provider so even if they have the 
 mean to travel to an adult specialist if they be locate in another 
 state as be often the case their coverage be deny across the 
 country there be more than pediatric clinic devote to care 
 for child with spina bifida there be only whose focus be on 
 adult 
   at the federal level we could make dramatic improvement in the 
 ability of adult with spina bifida to access quality care by 
 increase the funding of the cdc&#x27;s national spina bifida program the 
 only federal program task with improve the care and outcome for 
 people live with spina bifida in the spina bifida program 
 create a national spina bifida patient registry to collect the 
 scientific datum need to evaluate exist medical service for spina 
 bifida patient and to provide clinician researcher patient and 
 family a window into what care model be effective and what 
 treatment be not make a measurable difference build on this in 
 the spina bifida program fund the development of a spina bifida 
 collaborative care network to identify and to disseminate good 
 practice for the care of people with spina bifida at all age 
 however with only $ in annual funding there be only 
 patient in the national registry limit the ability of 
 medical professional to glean knowledge that would advance research in 
 area critical to improve quality of life even modest increase to 
 this funding would make an enormous difference 
   additionally we should urge nih to work collaboratively across their 
 many division to well understand spina bifida as spina bifida can 
 affect every organ and every system in the human body a collaborative 
 effort undertake by nih could result in research that would lead to 
 well care for both this generation and future generation of spina 
 bifida patient moreover the new designation of those with 
 disability as a health disparity create a new opportunity to harness 
 federal resource for the spina bifida community by ensure their 
 representation in nih research and thereby recognize those with this 
 complex condition in a new and critical light 
   we be so fortunate today that our country be benefit from the 
 talent and contribution of the generation of adult live with 
 spina bifida today i honor and celebrate all of they along with 
 their care partner and also remember those we have lose to this 
 condition i urge my colleague to not only increase funding for the 
 national spina bifida program but to work together so that these 
 americans receive the care and treatment all of we want for our 
 family and love one

                       wednesday october 

   ms. norton mr. speaker today i introduce the federal gift shop tax 
 act which would allow state and local government to impose a sale 
 tax at gift shop on federal property these government would be able 
 to generate million of dollar in new tax revenue 
   when the federal government engage in activity that be not 
 inherently governmental such as operate a gift shop there be no 
 reason to exempt customer purchase from a sale tax the item sell at 
 federal gift shop such as jewelry apparel accessory game and 
 book be subject to a sale tax if sell on private property 
 customer be often unaware of the exemption from a sale tax at gift 
 shop on federal property so the introduction of a sale tax be 
 unlikely to have a significant impact on gift shop sale it would 
 however create a valuable revenue stream for state and local 
 government in addition state and local government often provide 
 uncompensated service on federal property such as fire service and 
 allow they to impose a sale tax at gift shop on federal property 
 would allow they to recoup some of these cost 
   this bill be of particular importance to the district of columbia 
 which be home to a number of gift shop on federal property such as at 
 the smithsonian institution and the john f. kennedy center for the 
 performing arts 
   i strongly urge my colleague to support this bill
