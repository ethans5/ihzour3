 national institutes of health 
   f&amp;a cost help keep the light on at research facility across the 
 country these cost be essential reimbursement for operational 
 expense incur by university and other research institution for 
 conduct research on behalf of the government this amendment would 
 greatly affect the ability of research institution to operate cutting- 
 edge laboratory and maintain utility such as heating or hazardous 
 waste disposal 
   this amendment would reduce critical scientific research that 
 directly contribute to our ability to save life and reduce 
 suffering for the community we serve most medical breakthrough be 
 federally support and take place at medical school teaching 
 hospital and other research institution across the country without 
 the federal government&#x27;s reimbursement of f&amp;a cost institution would 
 be force to scale back research that may help develop the next vaccine 
 or cure for cancer alzheimer&#x27;s and other health threat or the next 
 technological innovation that will create new business or medical 
 device 
   as a result of these cut americans will have to wait long for 
 cure and our country will cede scientific breakthrough to foreign 
 competitor such as china which be heavily invest in this space 
 this would undermine our nation&#x27;s economic competitiveness and erode 
 the united states&#x27 longstanding commitment to medical research that have 
 yield countless benefit to society and our well being 
   in summary cut essential f&amp;a cost for scientific research would 
 result in slow scientific progress long wait for cure few
