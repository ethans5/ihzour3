        dear members of congress we write to urge you to oppose 
      the weakening of a law that protect the million of sport 
      fan and spectator who attend professional and collegiate 
      sporting event each year the current statutory ban on 
      aircraft include unmanned aircraft system ` ` uas&#x27;&#x27 or 
      drone fly over large stadium sporting event throughout 
      the country provide necessary safety and security 
      protection against real and potential threat 
        we be deeply concerned about section of the house 
      version of the federal aviation administration ` ` faa&#x27;&#x27 
      reauthorization act if adopt the language would establish 
      a broad and complex waiver program that would permit 
      countless aircraft to fly near and over stadium during 
      game put million of fan at risk and unnecessarily 
      so congress wisely eliminate a similar waiver program back 
      in after discover troubling and persistent failure 
      gap and vulnerability in the process for conduct 
      background check and issue waiver 
        the faa establish flight restriction over large 
      stadium sporting event immediately follow the terrorist 
      attack of september in response to concern about 
      terrorist use aircraft as weapon congress subsequently 
      twice codify and strengthen these restriction provide 
      specific criterion for aircraft operation permit within 
      the flight restrict area section would effectively 
      eliminate the specific criterion and replace it with an open- 
      end waiver program 
        the long stand congressionally mandate flight 
      restriction enhance the safety and security of large stadium 
      event while minimize the disruption to the national 
      airspace system ` ` nas&#x27;&#x27 specifically airspace over large 
      stadium with a seating capacity of people or more 
      and where nfl mlb and ncaa division football game or 
      major motor speedway event such as nascar and indycar 
      race be take place be close to all aircraft from 
      hour before until hour after a major sporting event the 
      flight restriction extend to nautical mile from the 
      center of the stadium and from the surface to foot 
      above the stadium the flight restriction do not apply to 
      authorized aircraft such as department of defense law
