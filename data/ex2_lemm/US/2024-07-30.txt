 treasury department police officer and the public by allow all the 
 officer include those who work at the bureau of engraving and 
 printing bep to carry their government firearm home 
   bep officer be not allow to take their government firearm home 
 however bep officer can be target because they wear uniform to and 
 from work many bep officer carry personal firearm to and from work 
 because they be not allow to take their government firearm home 
 and some be force to leave those personal firearm in their car 
 while they be on duty create a possibly dangerous situation 
   allow bep officer to carry their government firearm home will 
 put they in the same position as mint officer although both agency 
 be under the treasury department under treasury department rule mint 
 officer be allow to carry their government firearm home while bep 
 officer be not there be no meaningful distinction between officer 
 for these agency they should be treat equally 
   this bill would allow all police officer in the treasury department 
 to carry their government firearm home to protect officer and the 
 public eliminate separate carrying rule for the treasury 
 department&#x27;s different law enforcement agency 
   i ask my colleague to support this bill
